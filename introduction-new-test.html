    Welcome to an abundent book on humor! This is a readably massive book on humor&mdash;there are 200 sections that use 1000 examples, 200 figures. This is an essential book on humor. 
    
    This book focuses on "humor dynamics"&mdash;that is, humor over time. We frown as we hear a joke, pause to think, laugh a bit, feel lightly amused for a while, forget about it, think about it later and laugh, tell a friend and have them get angry at us. There's a lot going on here! Understanding all of this is the goal of this book&mdash;humor dynamics. 
        
<p>As we do this, we'll learn how to generate humor with the help of things we don’t always think of as “humor”—like arguments, compliments, favors, gifts, gratitude, insults, looks, needling, rough-housing, teasing, timing, and so on. Sometimes we can also generate humor by choosing to do nothing at all.</p>
    

<p>Humor has a reputation for being unteachable or unlearnable—but it's not! Like anything else, humor is something that can be taught and learned. That's because humor happens as a coherent process—we can learn the universal pattern to humor, which lets us better predict, describe, and use humor.</p>

<p>This universal pattern of humor has been in front of us all our lives, which is why it'll seem both familiar and surprising at the same time. Since we've been observing humor all our lives, we have all the data we need to make sense of humor—we're usually just need some catalytic insight to put all these observations into the same system.</p>

<p>To provide this insight, this book will be both analytic and narrative. We'll use an analytical model of humor to stay organized in our thinking, while grounding this model to hundreds of narrative stories about daily life. Together, these two approaches will help us arrive at an elegant, comprehensive, and practical way of thinking about humor.</p>

<p>All this will be fun, in a serious way. Understanding humor is like putting together an enormous puzzle—a puzzle where the clues have been scattered everywhere, across all the hours of all our days. As these pieces come together, we'll not only better understand ourselves and others—we'll feel more freedom of action in the world.</p>

<p>We'll dive right in. Good luck! by the end, you'll know more about humor than just about anyone—and see firsthand that the more we know about humor, the more true improvement we find in the quality of our lives.</p>

<p>By the end, we'll want to be able to easily answer questions like: "why did I find that funny?" or "how could someone possibly laugh at that?!"</p>

<p>We'll learn other things too—including about how humor relates to things like seriousness, "darkness," appropriateness, connection, meanness, insight, and so on. In other words—we'll be learning a lot!</p> 


Welcome to The Humor Book!


Hey! I'm Hadrian. I've been working on this book for several years, and I'm excited to be able to share it with more people! 


(That's me, the author!)

I started this book when I realized there weren't many good teaching 
guides to humor—and the ones that did exist tended to be incoherent or 
narrow. Above all, I thought that they didn't really capture the full order and beauty there was to humor.

We'll be coming to grips with this order and beauty throughout this book, and it will be wildly fun. We'll find coherence where we thought was randomness, and potency in ourselves where we thought were limitations.

So what is this book about?

This book answers an initially puzzling question:"why do we sometimes laugh, and sometimes don't laugh?" 

More broadly, this book is about all the questions we have about smiling and laughing—all the when, what, why, who, how, how much, how long, so what, what if, and so on. These answers together comprise what we'll be calling "humor." 

At the outset, it's worth noting that this book is about much more than just comedy. We do sometimes laugh at jokes—but then again, we also sometimes laugh at insults, feasts, gifts, hugs, weather, vegetables, and so on. So why stick with jokes, when we could stick with laughter? 

When
 we explain laughter, this will explain why we sometimes laugh at 
jokes—but also why we sometimes laugh at insults, feasts, gifts, 
hugs—and everything else besides. We'll find the simplest answer that 
explains the most things.

Elephant in the room 
One of the challenges of learning about humor is just how big it is. It's a bit like the story of the Blind Mice and the Elephant, where each blind mouse declares what they think it is they're touching:


One blind mouse runs up the leg and says “it’s a tree trunk!” 
Another goes up the tail, and says “it’s a rope!” 
The last clambers around the ear and says “it’s a curtain!”
This is like humor, where at at different times, we come across humor as:

sometimes comedy, sometimes tragedy
sometimes frivolous, sometimes important
sometimes mean, sometimes kind
sometimes related to anxiety, sometimes to confidence
sometimes related to success, sometimes to failure
sometimes related to jokes, sometimes to straight-talk
sometimes about truth, sometimes about lies
sometimes about insight, and sometimes about randomness
(and so on)

What sort of elephant is this? In some ways, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle in front of us but no box. We have to arrange the pieces harmoniously together, and then see what the picture is.

Preconceived notions

As we get closer to assembling this Big Picture of humor, we'll be untangling many of our tangled knots about humor. These knots are fallacies in our informal logic—many of which we may recognize:

"I can't teach others humor. Therefore humor can't be taught."
"Some people are naturally funny. Therefore I can't be funnier."
"Comedians are funny. Therefore, comedians are the standard to which we should all compare our humor skills too." 
"Some humor is trivializing. Therefore, all humor is trivializing."
"We sometimes laugh at jokes. Therefore everything we laugh at is a joke."
"While my mom and I laugh around each other a lot, she's never told a single joke. Therefore, she's bad at humor."
"Funny movies sometimes have clever and witty scripts. Therefore, to make people laugh, I'd have to be clever and witty."
"People laughed when I spoke up. Therefore I should feel shame." 
(and so on)
When put starkly like this, it's often easy to see these conclusions don't follow. These are the kinds of things we'll want to unlearn—a process that will make our thinking much lighter, truer, and powerful.

We'll be dispelling myths around humor—like that humor can't be taught. As these myths are broken down, we'll feel a bit like we're opening the curtains to the world—something that lets in more light and gives us a beautiful view.

You'll have no fun in this book 

To set expectations—this is a serious book! The goal is foremost to be learning humor, in a way that takes root in us. This will be rewarding hard work—we'll finish with new insights and abilities. But it'll be more like reading a textbook than reading a comedy.

To do this, we'll be learning an analytical model of humor. We'll expand this into an observational system to make sense of what's happening around us, and why. Then, we'll use this model as a methodology for producing smiles and laughs—and, finally, to draw inferences about what the absence or presence of laughter means about people, events, and places.

We'll go through all of this step-by-step until we're comfortable with an elegant, organized, and productive worldview of humor.

Fieldwork in humor 

My experiences as an after school teacher, barista, canvasser, cashier, dance teacher, facilitator, greeter, tutor, and so on make up the base observations used in this book. This starts the book from a specific place about what humor is, and what it looks like.

When we think about who makes people laugh and smile, we often think about comedians—but cashiers and waiters also try to make people laugh too! These are "real life" humorists who sink or swim on their ability to produce smiles and laughs, often in challenging emotional terrain.

We'll study comedians some in this book, but we'll mostly focus on these more day-to-day interpersonal interactions. These will get us closer to the questions that will be most insightful to answer.

Have you ever made someone laugh by comforting them? 
Can you dress normally but in a way that you know will make someone laugh when they see you? 
Have you ever bonded with someone by laughing over a shared accident?
Have you ever teased someone, knowing they would laugh and not cry? 
Have you been with a friend when they heard good news, and laughed with them? 
Have you ever watched someone calm someone by making them laugh? 
Have you ever seen strangers smile together and cease being strangers?
Have you ever gotten someone to do something not by saying "please," but by smiling?
What's going on here? By focusing on these kinds of questions, we'll start getting at the central mystery humor.

Research
This book is more or less a stand-alone product of my observations of the world. I otherwise did very little academic research on this book, so it's not a good way to get acquainted with the (sometimes very weird) lineage of academic humor scholarship.

The notable exception to this was Warren Shibles' Online Humor Reference Guide, which made up the nucleus of what I've written in this book. The Online Humor Reference Guide is one of the weirdest books ever written, and I'm grateful I stumbled across it in high school. It turned me into a kind of sleeper agent for humor ethnography.

For years, I assumed that everyone walked around with competing theories and models of humor in their head. It wasn't until I finally got around to university as an adult student that I realized not many people had a good idea about why people laughed!

It was an absence that had negative ramifications for their awareness, influence, inference-drawing, friend-making, scholarship, teaching, and so on. And so I realized there was a need for an accessible, practical, sturdy, and straightforward book about humor—something for everyone.

This book is for you

Institutions have never really treated humor as importantly as it is. What's the ratio of people who read a Shakespeare play to people who read a how-to book on humor in high school?

We live with the consequences of this, because a collective understanding of humor is something that filters down to us everywhere in our lives. And a weak understanding of humor leads to problems, while a strong understanding of humor leads to solutions. 

Our individual understanding of humor matters too, since our humor is like an aura of ability. It's how we form acquaintances and grow closer to them—how we make successful arguments—how we ask for and give aid—interpret the world around us.
Humor is important! And so this book is for thoughtful architects, advocates, cashiers, coaches, civil engineers, facilitators, high schoolers, historians, mathematicians, parents, professors, teachers, therapists, and so on. Since humor is for everyone, this book is for you.

It's almost time to start

Look, I'm so excited you're about to start! I've had a wonderful time putting this book together, and the process of doing so has certainly changed my own life. It's my hope that you'll find re-encountering humor in this way to be something that provides you with long-lasting wonder as well.


Welcome to The Humor Book!


This is a teaching guide to humor. Essentially, we’re going to be looking humor right in the face—and seeing what this does to us. (Spoiler: it does good things!)

We’ll be coming to grips with the order and beauty of humor, and as we do so, we’ll be shining a light on our own potency—in how we make sense of the world, interact with others, and create and find happiness.

So what is this book about?
This book is about the universal pattern to why we laugh, and why we don’t laugh.("Humor.") That means this means this book is about more than just comedy. We sometimes laugh at jokes, sure—but we also sometimes laugh at hugs too.

We want to explain all laughter—and all absences of laughter—in the same pattern. This will explain why we laugh when told a joke—but also why we laugh whenever.

—It's almost time to start
Look, I'm so excited you're about to start! I've had a wonderful time putting this book together, and the process of doing so has certainly changed my own life. It's my hope that you'll find re-encountering humor in this way to be something that provides you with long-lasting wonder as well.


To recapitulate, this book detailed an analytical model of emotions, with an emphasis on humor. We described humor as an emotion that behaved in discoverable patterns—and described emotions as a way we communicate evaluatory information with ourselves and others. 

For most readers, the ideas in this book are both familiar and surprising at the same time. We’ve observed everything mentioned in this book, but these observations weren’t always coherently organized. Essentially, the goal of this book is to provide enough catalytic insight that we can organize our own observations in elegant ways. 

A model isn’t successful when it has no flaws. Instead, a model is successful when it improves on what model we were using before. The goal of our model is to increase our accuracy and confidence in describing and predicting humor in our day-to-day lives. 

The end goal of the model isn’t the model itself—that would be treating the means as the ends. Instead, the model is like a ladder to reach greater intuitive capability with humor and with people. In that sense, the ladder doesn’t matter at all. If it helps us get to where we’re going, we’ll eventually set aside the ladder.

Finally, we used this model to find operationalizable definitions for things like learning, joy, health, and so on. Despite the obvious importance of these ideas, they’re often left vague or undefined. Attempts to define these things are often ignored out of habit.  

When we pull back the blinds to look at humor, we’re letting in more light from the window—and find that the whole thing may be vaster and more varied that we had thought, in ways we already knew, but had never really stopped to think about.

Owen: “Okay! That’s the end of the book!” 
Zoe: *waves* “Bye!” 
Emma: *beams* “Byeee!” 




By finishing this book, you now know more about humor than almost anyone else alive! That’s pretty cool. Many people are taught many amazing and complicated things, like astrophysics or ancient Assyrian—but access to practical information about emotions are hard to come by. This is particularly true of humor, which is rarely described as an emotion.

Opens the door of humor a bit wider—makes us think that the whole thing of the thing might be vaster and far more varied that we had thought, in ways we already knew, but had never really stopped to think about. Light from the window. As we followed the consequences of this model, we connected humor to ideas of joy and health.
