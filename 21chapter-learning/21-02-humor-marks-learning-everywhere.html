<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>




<p>We often associate learning with teaching—like Justin leading a discussion. But since we learn when we feel humor, we can learn everywhere—like when watching a movie or when talking with friends.</p> 

<p>In the movie below, two friends are having an earnest discussion about manners. When the characters (and Emma) feel humor, they feel an argument has been supported and they gain a new perspective:</p>

 
<p>Emma is watching Pulp Fiction.</p>

<p>Two hitmen—Jules and Vincent—are talking about how Antoine gave Marsellus’ wife a foot massage, so Marsellus threw him out the window. The hitmen are arguing about whether Marsellus overreacted or not. Jules says a foot massage isn’t intimate—it’s nothing. Vincent disagrees, and says a foot massage is in the same ballpark as any sexual act.</p>

<p>Jules: (Incredulous) “It ain't no fucking ballpark! Now look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touching his wife’s feet and sticking your tongue in her holiest of holies ain’t the same ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fucking sport. Look. Foot massages don’t mean shit.”</p>

<p>Vincent: (Unperturbed) (challenging) “Have you ever given a foot massage?”</p>

<p>Jules: *scoffs* (Bravado) “Don’t be telling me about foot massages. I’m the foot fucking master.”</p>

<p>Vincent: *setting up his argument* “Given a lot of them?”</p>

<p>Jules: “Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I don’t tickle or nothing.” </p>

<p>Vincent: *wryly* “Would you give a guy a foot massage?”</p>

<p>Emma: *smiles* (&larr;Emma feels Vincent has supported his argument and given new perspectives)</p>

<p>Jules: *pause* “Fuck you.”</p>

<p>Vincent: *smirks* (&larr;Vincent feels he has supported his argument that a foot massage is intimate) (Pressing advantage) “You give them a lot?”</p>

<p>Jules: “Fuck. You.” *keeps walking*</p>

<p>Vincent: *smirking* (mocking) “You know, I’m kind of tired, I could use a foot massage myself.”</p>

<p>Jules: *annoyed* “You best back off, I’m getting a little pissed here.” (&larr;no humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jules does not feel Vincent has supported his argument and Vincent has not gained a new perspective) “Here’s the door.”</p>

<p>The hitmen check their watches. It’s not time to go in and execute the targets yet. They step away from the door and resume their conversation.</p>

<p>Jules: (Rebutting) “Now look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antoine off a building into a glass-motherfucking-house. That shit ain’t right.</p>

<p>Vincent: I ain’t saying it’s right. But you're saying a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm saying it does. Now look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages—and they all meant something. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fucking cool about them. This sensual thing's going on that nobody's talking about, but you know it and she knows it, fucking Marsellus knew it—and Antoine should’ve known fucking better. That's his fucking wife, man. He ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit. You know what I’m saying?”</p>

<p>Jules: *pauses* *thinks about it* (Conceding) “It’s an interesting point.” *thumps Vincent’s chest approvingly* “C’mon. Let’s get into character.” (&larr;humor tells like touching others, social tightening, relaxed posture, informal movement, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;humor outcomes like eased tension, symbolized close ties, supported argument, reduced defensiveness, revealed personal view, handled complaints, been acceptably criticized, controlled situation, avoided conflict, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;humor family words acceptance, appreciation, connection, insight, reconciliation, realization, release, revelation, relief, safety, and so on)</p>

<p>Emma: *smiling* “Quentin Tarantino’s a genius.”</p>



<p>When Jules feels humor on the topic ‘the intimacy of foot massages,’ he’s learned something—his humor was part of a new perspective emerging in coexistence with other perspectives.</p>


<p>Jules’ humor doesn’t mean his entire worldview flipped and he now wholeheartedly embraces the new perspective. Instead, his humor just means he came to terms with the existence of that perspective—he gained a new perspective, in part because he felt Vincent supported an argument.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">Jules’ humor is about his own perspective and his relation to content. That means we can use his humor to learn about him and his evaluations—but we can’t really use his humor to directly learn about the quality of the perspective itself, or the quality of the supporting arguments.</p>

 

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><headline>Humor bush.</headline> An existing humor bush helped Jules and Vincent incorporate new perspectives—similar to how a humor bush helped Justin and his class incorporate new perspectives.</p>
    
    <p>They had the interpersonal tools and circumstances to contest, examine, and potentially give credence to new framings around each other, since they could characterize their relationship with each other as tensions easily reduce, close ties are often symbolized, conflict easily avoided, new perspectives often given, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>By contrast, if Jules was talking to a stranger he might simply have cut the discussion off as soon as he got angry, and not felt any need to try to synchronize with the stranger.</p>
