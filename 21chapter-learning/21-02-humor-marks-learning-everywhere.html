<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor shows learning everywhere</h1>

<p>We <term>learn</term> in more places than just around professors, because we feel <em>humor</em> in more places than around professors.</p>


<p>When we feel humor when watching a movie or by talking with friends, we're also learning:</p>

<p>When Jules feels humor on the topic ‘the intimacy of foot massages,’ he’s learned something related to that topic—his humor was part of a new perspective, emerging in coexistence with other perspectives.</p>


<p>Jules’ humor doesn’t mean his entire worldview flipped and he now wholeheartedly embraces the new perspective. Instead, his humor just means he came to terms with the <sem-weak>existence</sem-weak> of that perspective—he <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, he felt Vincent <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Jules’ humor is about his own perspective and his relation to content. That means we can use his humor to learn about him and his <term>evaluations</term>—but we <outcome-contrast>can’t</outcome-contrast> really use his humor to directly learn about the <em>quality</em> of the perspective itself, or the quality of the supporting arguments.</p>
</div>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Humor bush.</headline> Jules and Vincent's existing humor bush helped them incorporate new perspectives—similar to how Justin and his class's humor bush helped them incorporate new perspectives.</p>
    
    <p>Their humor bush was why Jules and Vincent could characterize their overall relationship with each other as <humor-outcome>tensions <outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> reduce</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>close ties are <outcome-contrast>often</outcome-contrast> symbolized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>conflict <outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> avoided</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives <outcome-contrast>often</outcome-contrast> given</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>This humor bush meant they had developed the interpersonal commitment and familiarity to be able to contest, examine, and potentially give credence to new framings when around each other.</p>
    
    <p>By contrast, if Jules was talking to a stranger or new coworker, Jules might simply have cut the discussion off as soon as he got angry&mdash;and not felt any commitment from the past to try to synchronize to a new evaluatory perspective.</p>
