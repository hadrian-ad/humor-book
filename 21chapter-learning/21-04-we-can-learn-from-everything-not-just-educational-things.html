<p>Fitted humor shows that we’re incorporating new framings or perspectives, which is true whether or not the humor is associated with formal learning or schools.</p>

   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think something is “educational” (Clouds over the Atlantic), and other things aren’t (Pulp Fiction). But when there’s fitted humor, it’s all the same process of learning—whether or not it’s associated with schools or universities.</p>

<p>In all these examples, people feel tension when they encounter new framings or perspectives. Humor shows that this tension isn’t ongoing, but has been resolved. These new perspectives or framings can happen anywhere—and collectively contribute to our overall opinion of something.</p> 

<p>Since humor has a communicative function, humor tells are the expression of learning.</p>
