<p>While we <term>can</term> learn from educational books, homework assignments, instructive fables, podcasts, and so on, we don't <em>always</em>&mdash;and we don't <sem>only</sem> have to learn from these things.</p>

<p>Fitted humor shows that we’re incorporating new framings or perspectives, no matter what the subject or circumstance:</p>

<p>In all these examples, people feel tension when they encounter new framings or perspectives. Humor shows that this tension isn’t ongoing, but has been resolved. This learning can happen anywhere&mdash;whether associated with school subjects or not.</p> 

<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Mistake handlers.</headline> We find mistakes inherently interesting&mdash;which means we find interesting the people who can take mistakes and

        </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>This is part of the appeal of many authors, comedians, life coaches, podcasters, scientists, spiritualists, teachers, video essayists, and so on: they deal with mistakes in various ways, which we experience as learning.</p> 
    
    <p>We’re drawn toward people who make us feel the most fitted humor the most frequently—since fitted humor means we see them as elegantly handling mistakes, putting us in the Goldilocks zone of humor between mistake-predominant <callback>(<emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>confusion</emotions>, <emotions>worry</emotions>, and so on)</callback> and OK-predominant <callback>(<emotions>boredom</emotions>, <emotions>daydreaming</emotions>, <emotions>unenthusiastic</emotions>)</callback>. We experience this as learning and growing&mdash;as humor.</p>
    
        <p>We don’t always think to notice this humor until it’s pointed out—but then we see it everywhere. When our partner:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            listens to their favorite podcast, they'll often <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            reads a nonfiction book that interests them, they’ll come to tell us about a passage <callback>(<humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>)</callback>

    </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>This in turn grows a humor bush with those things, creating a positive overall opinion of them. We have a positive opinion of things that we feel grow our range of perspetives&mdash;that cause us to learn.</p>

    A deeper look (Conspiracy theories)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">

   <p>We learn by feeling humor—even if what we’re learning is “wrong.” This is most obvious with conspiracy theories, which are initially captivating because of how much humor we feel from them. We feel humor because we encounter a lot of new perspectives from them!</p>

<p>That's because conspiratorial thinking involves <sem-weak>many</sem-weak> things that deviate from what we expect—and often in a way that at first seems to have no consequences. We feel humor when we hear someone say Elvis was actually an English aristocrat <callback>(large mistake)</callback> and know it's nonsense <callback>(large OK)</callback>.

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">Humor doesn't show the quality or comparative accuracy of these perspective&mdash;humor just shows these perspectives are concordantly coming into coexistence with all the other ones.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When hear that Elvis was an English aristocrat, we smile at that perspective, and we add it into the pile of perspectives&mdash;and probably never consider it as a "good" perspective for anything other than making people laugh or prompting imaginary universes.</p>
    
    </div>

<p>We often come across insincerely held conspiracy theories in spectator entertainment. The humor we feel toward them is obvious:</p>



<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Heather always loved <book-title>The Da Vinci Code</book-title>. It's about a global conspiracy to hide the fact that Jesus had an heir and a bloodline that the church has spent centuries hiding. It's just a fun twist on the world!</narration> <notes>(&larr;Heather incorporates a new framing&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
</div>



<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Owen is watching <book-title>Avenger League: Animated</book-title>. One of the superheroes, Question, is a conspiracy theorist—the others think he's crazy but he's often right.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Question:</speaker> <action>*mumbling*</action> <speech>“The plastic tips on the end of shoelaces are called aglets. Their true purpose is sinister.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Owen incorporates a new framing&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
</div>



<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Justin reads <book-title>Foucault’s Pendulum</book-title>. It’s about historians who mock conspiracy theorists by inventing their own. The problem is, no matter how wild their fake conspiracy becomes, it increasingly seems real to them.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Justin smiles as more historical characters are fit together into a vast web of invented conspiracy.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Justin incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
</div>



<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Dave sends Justin a satirical article.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Article:</speaker> <speech>“Historians Admit To Inventing Ancient Greeks.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Justin reads through it, delighted.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Justin incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
</div>


<p>Heather, Owen, Justin, and Dave are incorporating new framings—they're learning—even if these framings are ultimately surreal and not useful in a conventional sense.</p>

<p>The same process happens when we encounter conspiracy theories that are presented more sincerely:</p>



<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration><narration>Justin sees a friend post an article about how Franklin Roosevelt was actually a Japanese secret agent. Justin laughs aloud.</narration></narration> <notes><notes>(&larr;Justin incorporates a new framing&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>He opens the blog post and reads it, fascinated. It’s filled with bizarre rantings about how Paul Newman is still alive, and had killed Kennedy, and how politicians have all been decapitated and had their heads reattached. There’s no trace of self-awareness in the post.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Justin has a confused, delighted smile the whole time.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Justin incorporates a new framing&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p> </div>


<p>Justin feels humor—which doesn’t mean he "believes" these new <term>sincerely</term>-offered framings, any more than he believed the <em>insincerely</em>-offered framings in his novel.</p> 

<p>His humor just marks that he incorporated new perspectives and new framings, which doesn't directly tell us anything about his relation to these framings&mdash;other than the fact that they've been encountered vividly, and in a way he flows with instead of fights with.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Justin feels it's a large mistake to have someone say Roosevelt was a Japanese secret agent. At the same time, he also has a large OK, since the whole thing strikes him as bizarre and dissociated. He laughs as he concordantly metabolizes this new framing.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">In other contexts, the OK might not be large enough to generate humor, and Justin would reject the framing&mdash;like if millions of people were believing this was true. He's still exposed to this new perspective, but he no longer concordantly incorporates it.</p>
</div>


<p>This is all just a normal part of how we work and relate to the world—which is why it’s the same pattern for jokes. When we laugh at the punchline of a joke, it's not that we "believe" the framing or take it seriously—we've just incorporated a new framing:</p>



<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“… and that’s why they called him moo-shroom!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe incorporates a new framing, which doesn’t mean she thinks this framing is useful)</notes> <speech>“That’s terrible, Owen!”</speech></p>
</div>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(fake seriousness)</internalaction> <speech>“You know about the Marx brothers, Groucho, and so on? Well it turns out there was a sister, too, she wasn't famous but was a track coach. Her name was Anja...”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <action>*groans*</action> "Anja Marx?"
    <notes>(&larr;Zoe incorporates a new framing, which doesn’t mean she thinks this framing is useful)</notes></p>
</div>


<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer are watching an old movie.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*leans over*</action> <internalaction>(insincerely)</internalaction> <speech>“What if Paul Newman killed Kennedy?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> *laughs* <notes>(&larr;Jennifer incorporates a new framing, which doesn’t mean she thinks this framing is useful)</notes> “What?!”</p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    </div>

<p>When people get caught up in exclusionary, isolated, in-bred, or stagnant thinking <callback>(“conspiracy theories”)</callback>, They're usually first drawn to those framings by the humor they felt when first engaging with it.</p> 

<p>They start with podcasts or videos that make them feel humor. These are tailored to produce mistakes and OKs for skeptical people, with plenty of hedging and performance to ensure that evaluations shift in a way that generates humor.</p> 



<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Justin is listening to RealTawk. The host is some kind of clown, fat with a booming voice and an friendly-but-disconnected flow to his talk.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Host:</speaker> <speech>“Wanna hear something crazy? Paul Newman! With the rifle! I mean, it sounds crazy. But when you actually look at where he was in 1963, it is interesting how things don't add up. I mean, I don't think he actually did it—crazy!—but it would be interesting to find out what he was doing that year. What are you hiding, Newman?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;host hedges framing to better shift mistakes and OKs into humor)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Justin smiles.</narration></p>
</div>

<p>Of course, eventually what’s initially <term>unexpected</term> <sem>becomes</sem> <em>expected</em>. <callback>("Of course it's <outcome-contrast>plausible</outcome-contrast> Paul Newman killed Kennedy, that's just fact.")</callback> To get more humor, you have to creep the mistake even larger. <callback>("Of course Paul Newman <outcome-contrast>probably</outcome-contrast> killed Kennedy")</callback>

    <p>Eventually, someone starts defending those framings from their previous framings. If someone tells them that Paul Newman <sem-weak>didn't</sem-weak> kill Kennedy, this perspective has a high mistake and low-OK to them&mdash;and they feel anger instead of humor.</p> 

<p>At this point, their lack of humor on these topics shows their inability to tolerate alternative framings&mdash;they can't concordantly incorporate other perspectives.</p>

<p>This process often stands out to us when it involves <term>conspiracy</term> theories. But it’s just a process that happens <em>everywhere</em> in our lives—since this is all just a feature of how we learn and adhere to things. Humor measures our rigidity or flexibility with framings and perspectives.</p>

<p>That’s why we’ll see similar things happening all over the place, like with:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>professional historians and cherished academic theories</li>
    <li>amateur historians and cherished counter-academic theories</li>
    <li>meritocratists and ideas that outcomes are solely reflective of personality</li>
    <li>nationalists and mythologies about nations</li>
    <li>gaming forums and ideals about a franchise</li>
    <li>ideologues and central tenets of that ideology</li>
    <li>depressed people and ideas about worthlessness</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>In each case, we’ll see a similar pattern. Humor is initially involved in learning and incorporating new framings—like an academic theory. But eventually, it becomes fixed. When presented with a framing from <sem>outside</sem> that framing, academically-involved peole may feel mistake-predominant emotions instead of humor.</p> 

<p>At this point, they’ve fallen into a sandtrap where their existing framings hinder their ability to incorporate new framings.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The point isn't that all new framings need to be seen as more useful or preferable to the framing we're using.</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">Instead, the point is to see how the lack of humor shows a rigid relation between people and framings—something shared between all kinds of dogmatic people.</p>
</div>


<p>This all happens in a shared system where humor is almost like the ball-bearings between our ability to switch framings.</p> 
   <!--
   <p>And as we’ll talk more about later, humor is involved in observing or repairing distortions or inflexibility about how we frame and think about things. But to do so, we have to understand the broader picture&mdash;the role humor plays in opinions and learning.</p>
