<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>



<p>We can look at examples where the presence of humor shows the presence of learning, and the absence of humor shows an absence of learning:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma enter the library, and glance at an illuminated manuscript from the 15th century on display.</narration></p>
    
    
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Hold up. Does that dude have a violin on his head?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma notices a mistake)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>They gather around the case.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor tells like focus on present, social tightening, loss of situational awareness, and so on)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*squinting*</action> <speech>“I guess it depends on when it’s from. When were violins invented anyway?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“What’s happening here? Why are there so many flowers?”</speech> <action>*half-smiles*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*Examining*</action> <speech>“Two people are fighting, one’s bloody… and running away?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“The guy on the left looks sad, and the guy on the right’s like, dude, what the fuck?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Treachery? Regret?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*looking closer*</action> <speech>“The guy on the left is holding the bottom of his sword. Do you think they ever held their blade like that, or is that just bad drawing?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“I guess if you had armored gloves, you could do it.”</speech> <internalaction>(thoughtfully)</internalaction> <speech>“It’s probably hard to do an upward swing otherwise, now that I’m thinking about it.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*satisfaction*</action> <speech>“Right under Violin-Man’s neck-thing! Blurgh!”</speech> <action>*mimes blood gushing*</action> <action>*smiles*</action></p>
    
    <p><narration>They move on in a better mood.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Emma incorporate new perspectives&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>There was fitted, low-intensity humor throughout the example, with an instance of more intense, less-fitted humor at the end. (“Blurgh!”)</p>

<p>The humor and the interpretation of the manuscript went hand-in-hand, which we can see by contrasting this with them not feeling humor:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">   
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma enter the library, and glance at an illuminated manuscript on display. They keep walking.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Emma don’t incorporate new perspectives&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes></p>
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma enter the library, and glance at an illuminated manuscript on display. Emma becomes enraged.</narration></p> 
    
    <p>Emma: <internalaction>(seething)</internalaction> <speech>“I hate these things.”</speech> </p>
    
     <p><narration>She can’t settle for an hour.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t incorporate new perspectives&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>

     <p>
         Zoe: <internalaction>(interested)</internalaction> <speech>“What do you think’s happening here?”</speech>
     </p> 
     
     <p><narration>Emma taps her foot impatiently, hanging back, trying to telegraph that they should move on.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t incorporate new perspectives&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma enter the library, and glance at an illuminate manuscript on display. They start joking about Violin-Head, and make up a stupid backstory for him. They double over laughing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;since most humor isn’t on topic ‘manuscript,’ Emma and Zoe aren’t incorporating new perspectives about the manuscript)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
<p>We can see more examples of humor marking learning:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma are doing Justin’s assigned reading: a 1915 booklet of pro-suffrage satirical poetry called Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times, which mocks inadequate arguments against women’s suffrage.</narration></p>
    
    <p>One satire presents the anti-suffragette arguments as absurd by using the same arguments to say women shouldn’t ride trains:</p>
    
    Why We Oppose Women Travelling in Railway Trains
    
    By Alice Duer Miller
    
    1. Because travelling in trains is not a natural right.
    
    2. Because our great-grandmothers never asked to travel in trains.
    
    3. Because woman’s place is the home, not the train.
    
    4. Because it is unnecessary; there is no point reached by a train that cannot be reached on foot.
    
    5. Because it will double the work of conductors, engineers and brakemen who are already overburdened.
    
    6. Because men smoke and play cards in trains. Is there any reason to believe that women will behave better?
    
    <p>Zoe: <action>*smiling*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe is incorporating new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <speech>“I like this one!”</speech></p>
    
    <p>Emma: <internalaction>(skeptical)</internalaction> <speech>“I get it, but train travel just doesn’t really do it for me.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma hasn’t comfortably incorporated new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p>Zoe: <speech>“I guess the today we’d have to imagine they’re talking about opposing women riding busses or cars instead.”</speech></p>
    
    <p>Emma: <speech>“Oh.”</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <speech>“Well, that’s even more ridiculous.”</speech></p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is doing homework and is reading about cells.</narration></p>
    
    <p>“Cells are small, but not unimaginably so. Cells are about one thousand times smaller in length than objects in our everyday world. Typical cells in our bodies are about ten micrometers in length—roughly one thousand times smaller than the last joint in your finger. A thousand-fold difference in length is not difficult to visualize: a grain of rice is about one thousand times smaller in length than the room you are sitting in. Imagine your room filled with rice grains, and this will give you an idea of the billion or so cells that make up your fingertip.”</p>

Video games use very, very simplified controls for vehicles. But even in these games, the vehicle you’re most likely to crash is a helicopter!”</speech></p>

    <p><speaker>Host:</speaker> <speech>“Point being, rotary-wing assets are expensive to maintain, both from maintaining the equipment and skills needed to use them. So why don’t countries get rid of them? Well, until you have something that can do their task better, you’re kind of stuck with them. If you’re deploying soldiers mountain top to mountain top, your choice is either donkeys or helicopter—and until that changes, most militaries will stick with helicopters, no matter their expense.”</speech></p>

    </div>
    
    <p>We have words like insight, learning, perspective-incorporation, teaching, understanding, and so on—and the connection between them all is humor.</p>

   <div class="vignette">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We learn on the topic that generates humor. If Trevor is interested in military helicopters, he wants to feel appreciation, insight, realization, and so on—but specifically on topics related to ‘military helicopters,’ and not ‘apples’ or ‘fantasy novels.’</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If a podcast makes him feel humor by irrelevant asides on apples or fantasy novels, Trevor will feel unfitted humor—it’s not on relevant topics. This means it woudl't be helping him incorporate new framings about what he’s trying to learn.</p>  
    </div>

<p>This is why we have a universal preference for the option of learning that produces more fitted humor. </p>

<p>When we have a choice, we always choose documentaries, non-fiction books, podcasts, and so on that we hope will make us feel connection, delight, insight, realization, and so on.</p>

 

<p>If we’re using something to learn that doesn’t let us feel delight, insight, realization, success, and so on we give them up or resent them.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Quality.</headline> Sometimes we think the amount we learn isn’t tied to humor, but to the quality of information. But it’s obvious the quality of information doesn’t matter so much—500 pages of raw data that we can’t make sense of doesn’t help us learn anything, no matter how impeccable the data is.</p>
    
    <p>In a less extreme example, a think tank report may have more dense and precise information in it than a podcast—but that doesn’t mean that everyone would learn more from the report than the podcast. Instead, everyone learns more from the option they feel more fitted humor at.</p>
    
    <p>Who feels fitted humor at something changes person-by-person. Trevor may feel more humor from the podcast—but a defense economist may feel more humor from the think tank report. That’s because a defense economist would have the context to feel insight or realization at a graph showing a 4.3% increase in global expenditure on rotary-wing aircraft—while Trevor won't.</p>
