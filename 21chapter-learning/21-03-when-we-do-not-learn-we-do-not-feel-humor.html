<h1 id="exclude-navigation">The absence of humor shows the absence of learning</h1>



<p>We can look at examples where the presence of humor shows the <term>presence</term> of learning, and the <outcome-contrast>absence</outcome-contrast> of humor shows an <em>absence</em> of learning:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma enter the library, and glance at an illuminated manuscript from the 15th century on display.</narration></p>

    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Hold up. Does that dude have a violin on his head?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma notices a mistake)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>They gather around the case.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor tells like <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*squinting*</action> <speech>“I guess it depends on when it’s from. When were violins invented anyway?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“What’s happening here? Why are there so many flowers?”</speech> <action>*half-smiles*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*Examining*</action> <speech>“Two people are fighting, one’s bloody and... running away?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“The guy on the left looks sad, and the guy on the right’s like, dude, what the fuck?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Treachery? Regret?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*looking closer*</action> <speech>“The guy on the left is holding the bottom of his sword. Do you think they ever held their blade like that, or is that just bad drawing?”</speech></p>

    </div>
    
<p>There was fitted, low-intensity humor throughout the example, with an instance of more intense, less-fitted humor at the end. <callback>(“Blurgh!”)</callback></p>

<p>To see how the humor and the interpretation of the manuscript went hand-in-hand, we can use contrasting examples of them <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feeling humor:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">   
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma enter the library, and glance at an illuminated manuscript on display.

    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma enter the library, and glance at an illuminate manuscript on display. They start joking about Violin-Head, and make up a stupid backstory for him.

    </div>
    
<p>We can see more examples where humor marks learning:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma are doing Justin’s assigned reading: a 1915 booklet of pro-suffrage satirical poetry called <book-title>Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times</book-title>, which mocks inadequate arguments against women’s suffrage.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>One satire presents the anti-suffragette arguments as absurd by using the same arguments to say women shouldn’t ride trains:</narration></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">Why We Oppose Women Travelling in Railway Trains</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">By Alice Duer Miller</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">1. Because travelling in trains is not a natural right.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">2. Because our great-grandmothers never asked to travel in trains.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">3. Because woman’s place is the home, not the train.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">4. Because it is unnecessary; there is no point reached by a train that cannot be reached on foot.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">5. Because it will double the work of conductors, engineers and brakemen who are already overburdened.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">6. Because men smoke and play cards in trains. Is there any reason to believe that women will behave better?</p>
    
    <p>Zoe: <action>*smiling*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe is incorporating new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe learns&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <speech>“I like this one!”</speech></p>

    <p>Zoe: <speech>“I guess the today we’d have to imagine they’re talking about opposing women riding busses or cars instead.”</speech></p>
    
    <p>Emma: <speech>“Oh.”</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma learns&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <speech>“Well, that’s even more ridiculous.”</speech></p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is doing homework and is reading about cells.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">“Cells are small, but not unimaginably so. Cells are about one thousand times smaller in length than objects in our everyday world. Typical cells in our bodies are about ten micrometers in length&mdash;roughly one thousand times smaller than the last joint in your finger. A thousand-fold difference in length is not difficult to visualize: a grain of rice is about one thousand times smaller in length than the room you are sitting in. Imagine your room filled with rice grains, and this will give you an idea of the billion or so cells that make up your fingertip.”</p>
    
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Zoe smiles at the analogy. This is really interesting!</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe learns&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

        <p>We have words like insight, learning, perspective-incorporation, teaching, understanding, and so on&mdash;and the connection between them all is fitted <sem>humor</sem>.</p>
