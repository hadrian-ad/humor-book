<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>



<p>We can look at examples where the presence of humor shows the <term>presence</term> of learning, and the <outcome-contrast>absence</outcome-contrast> of humor shows an <em>absence</em> of learning:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma enter the library, and glance at an illuminated manuscript from the 15th century on display.</narration></p>

    <p><narration>They gather around the case.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor tells like <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on)</notes></p>

    </div>
    
<p>There was fitted, low-intensity humor throughout the example, with an instance of more intense, less-fitted humor at the end. <callback>(“Blurgh!”)</callback></p>

<p>To see how the humor and the interpretation of the manuscript went hand-in-hand, we can use contrasting examples of them <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feeling humor:</p>

<p>We can see more examples where humor marks learning:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma are doing Justin’s assigned reading: a 1915 booklet of pro-suffrage satirical poetry called <book-title>Are Women People? A Book of Rhymes for Suffrage Times</book-title>, which mocks inadequate arguments against women’s suffrage.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>;sOne satire presents the anti-suffragette arguments as absurd by using the same arguments to say women shouldn’t ride trains:</narration></p>

    <p class="bookquote">1. Because travelling in trains is not a natural right.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">2. Because our great-grandmothers never asked to travel in trains.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">3. Because woman’s place is the home, not the train.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">4. Because it is unnecessary; there is no point reached by a train that cannot be reached on foot.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">5. Because it will double the work of conductors, engineers and brakemen who are already overburdened.</p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">6. Because men smoke and play cards in trains. Is there any reason to believe that women will behave better?</p>

    <p class="bookquote">“Cells are small, but not unimaginably so. Cells are about one thousand times smaller in length than objects in our everyday world.

A thousand-fold difference in length is not difficult to visualize: a grain of rice is about one thousand times smaller in length than the room you are sitting in. Imagine your room filled with rice grains, and this will give you an idea of the billion or so cells that make up your fingertip.”</p>

    <p>We have words like insight, learning, perspective-incorporation, teaching, understanding, and so on—and the connection between them all is fitted <sem>humor</sem>.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We learn on the <sem>specific topic</sem> that generates humor. So if Trevor is interested in military helicopters, he wants to feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, and so on—specifically <term>on</term> topics related to ‘military helicopters,’ and not <em>off</em>-topic on things like ‘apples’ or ‘fantasy novels.’</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If a podcast makes Trevor feel humor by making irrelevant asides on apples or fantasy novels, the humor will be unfitted—since his humor isn't on relevant topics. The irrelevent topics means he wouldn't be incorporating new framings about what he’s trying to learns.</p>  
    </div>

<p>When we have a choice, we always choose documentaries, non-fiction books, podcasts, and so on that we hope will make us feel <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>If we’re using something to learn that <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> let us feel <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on&mdash;we give them up or resent them.</p>

<p>This is why we have a universal preference for the option of learning that produces more fitted humor. Trevor will avoid the think tank report <callback>(no humor)</callback>, books for children <callback>(no humor)</callback>, and choose something that makes him feel humor on relevant topics&mdash;something that helps him learn.</p>


 



 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Quality.</headline> Sometimes we think the amount we learn isn’t tied to our frequency and intensity of fitted humor, but instead to the quality of information. But that's obviously not quite right when we think about it.</p> 
    
    <p>Giving a kid who can't read a 500 page report  wouldn't help them learn much on that topic&mdash;no matter how immaculate the anaylis is in that report. For the same reason, giving a 500 page report to an unmotivated adult also won't help them learn much on that topic.</p> 
    
    <p>Instead, it's the relation of the person to the content that determines learning&mdash;not content by itself. This is why how much someone learns from a podcast compared to a technical report depends on the user.</p> 
            
    <p><term>Trevor</term> may feel more humor from the <term>podcast</term>—but a <em>defense economist</em> may feel more humor from the <em>think tank report</em>. That’s because a defense economist would have the context to see a graph showing a 4.3% increase in global expenditure on rotary-wing aircraft as a mistake that's OK, and feel <emotions>insight</emotions> or <emotions>realization</emotions>—while Trevor won't.</p>
