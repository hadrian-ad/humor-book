<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>




We learn by feeling humor—even if what we’re learning is “wrong.” This is most obvious with conspiracy theories, which are initially captivating because of how much humor we feel from them—how much we learn from them.

That's because conspiratorial thinking involves many things that deviate from what we expect—and often in a way that at first seems to have no consequences, like if we know it's nonsense. 

This is obvious when we come across insincere conspiracy theories used in spectator entertainment:



Heather always loved The Da Vinci Code. It's about a global conspiracy to hide the fact that Jesus had an heir and a bloodline that the church has spent centuries hiding. It's just a fun twist on the world! (&larr;Heather incorporates a new framing&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)



Owen is watching Avenger League: Animated. One of the superheroes, Question, is a conspiracy theorist—the others think he's crazy but he's often right.

Question: *mumbling* “The plastic tips on the end of shoelaces are called aglets. Their true purpose is sinister.”

Owen: *laughs* (&larr;Owen incorporates a new framing&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)



Justin reads Foucault’s Pendulum. It’s about historians who mock conspiracy theorists by inventing their own, but slowly come to believe their own conspiracy theories themselves.

Justin smiles as more historical characters are fit together into a vast web of invented conspiracy. (&larr;Justin incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)



Dave sends Justin a satirical article.

Article: “Historians Admit To Inventing Ancient Greeks.”

Justin reads through it, delighted. (&larr;Justin incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)

Heather, Owen, Justin, and Dave are incorporating new framings ("learning")—even if these framings are ultimately surreal. 

The same process happens when we encounter conspiracy theories that are presented more sincerely:



Justin sees a friend post an article about how Franklin Roosevelt was actually a Japanese secret agent. Justin laughs aloud. (&larr;Justin incorporates a new framing&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)

He opens the blog post and reads it, fascinated. It’s filled with bizarre rantings about how Paul Newman is still alive, and had killed Kennedy, and how politicians have all been decapitated and had their heads reattached. There’s no trace of self-awareness in the post.

Justin has a confused, delighted smile the whole time. (&larr;Justin incorporates a new framing&harr;&#xFE0E;humor) 

Justin feels humor—which doesn’t mean he “believes” these new framings. His humor just marks that he learned or incorporated new framings—which doesn't directly tell us anything about his relation to these framings, other than the fact that they've been encountered vividly.

> Consider:

When Justin reads about Roosevelt being a Japanese secret agent, it’s a large mistake. He also has a large OK, since the whole thing strikes him as bizarre and dissociated. He laughs as he metabolizes this new framing.



In other contexts, the OK might not be large enough to generate humor—and Justin would reject the framing. For instance, if it was an effective propaganda piece being believed by tens of thousands of increasingly agitated people, Justin may feel a risk of negative personal consequences.

This is just a part of how we work and relate to the world—which is why it’s the same pattern for jokes. When we laugh at the punchline of a joke, it's not that we "believe" the framing or take it seriously—we've just incorporated a new framing:



Owen: “… and that’s why they called him moo-shroom!”

Zoe: *laughs* (&larr;Zoe incorporates a new framing, which doesn’t mean she thinks this framing is useful) “That’s terrible, Owen!”



Zoe and Emma are watching an old movie.

Emma: *leans over* (insincerely) “Did it ever occur to you that it was Paul Newman who killed Kennedy?”

Zoe: *laughs* (&larr;Zoe incorporates a new framing, which doesn’t mean she thinks this framing is useful) “What?!” 

People who get caught up in any kind of exclusionary, isolated, in-bred, or stagnant thinking (“conspiracy theories”) are usually initially drawn by the humor they feel when engaging with it. 

They start with podcasts or videos that make them feel humor—that produce mistakes that are OK. Often these are tailored for skeptical people, with plenty of hedging around the mistake and careful attention to the OK. This ensures they shift in a way that generates humor. 



Justin is listening to RealTawk.

Host: “Wanna hear something crazy? Paul Newman! With the rifle! I mean, it sounds crazy. But when you actually look at where he was in 1963, it is interesting how things don't add up. I mean, I don't think he actually did it—crazy!—but it would be interesting to find out what he was doing that year. What are you hiding, Newman?" (&larr;hedges framing to better shift mistakes and OKs into humor) 

Justin smiles.

Eventually, what’s initially unexpected becomes expected. ("Of course it's plausible Paul Newman killed Kennedy.") At this point, old framings start to be large mistakes with small OKs—where being confronted with old framings generate mistake-predominant emotions. (“Paul Newman didn't kill Kennedy. You sound unhinged!”) 

At this point, their lack of humor on these topics shows their inability to tolerate alternative framings—something that shows up frequently.

This process often stands out to us when it involves conspiracy theories, but it’s just a process that happens everywhere in our lives—since this is all just a feature of how we learn and evaluate the world around us. Humor marks our rigidity or flexibility with framings and perspectives.

That’s why we’ll see similar things happening all over the place, like with:

professional historians and cherished academic theories
amateur historians and cherished counter-academic theories
meritocratists and ideas about what they’re supposed to do in life
nationalists and mythologies about nations
gaming forums and ideals about a franchise
ideologues and central tenets of that ideology
depressed people and ideas about worthlessness
(and so on) 

In each case, we’ll see a similar pattern. Humor is initially involved in learning and incorporating new framings—like an academic theory. But eventually, it becomes fixed, and when presented with a framing from outside that framing, academically-involved peole can feel mistake-predominant emotions instead of humor. 

At this point, they’ve fallen into a sandtrap where their existing framings hinder their ability to incorporate new framings.

> Consider:

It's not that these all framings need to be seen as more useful or preferable to the framing we're using. Instead, it's to see how the lack of humor shows a rigid relation to some kinds of framings—something shared between all kinds of dogmatic people.

The point of all this isn’t exactly to say that all perspectives or framings are equal. Instead, the point is to think about the shared system in which all this happens—and the role humor has in all of this. 

And as we’ll talk more about later, humor is involved in observing or repairing distortions or inflexibility about how we frame and think about things.
