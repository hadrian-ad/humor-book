<p>Last chapter, we looked at how fitted humor and humor bushes together constituted our <a href="../20chapter-opinions/20-00-opinions.html">opinion</a> of something. In this chapter, we'll look at how fitted humor and humor bushes are involved in <vocab>learning</vocab>.</p>

<p>Humor is how we learn—when we learn, we feel humor. More specifically, humor is the process of incorporating new perspectives or framings:</p>

<p>In order to effectively create new perspectives and framings in his students, Justin thinks of his teaching as a series of humor attempts. When he does this, he’s better able to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (perspectives)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>share new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on. 
    </p>

<p>This is why his successful teaching generates humor, while his unsuccessful teaching does not.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When the class <term>doesn’t</term> feel humor, it’s a bit like pouring water over a stone—the potential new framings or perspectives are <sem-weak>there</sem-weak>, they just slide off them. When the class <em>does</em> feel humor, we know our class is actually incorporating new framings.</p> 
        
    </div> 


 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Learning.</headline> We don’t always notice the relation between humor and learning, in part because we often only notice humor where we expect to find it. We'll scan ourselves for humor while watching a <term>show</term>, but not while doing <em>math homework</em>.</p>
    
    <p>But once it’s pointed out, we notice that we <sem-weak>do</sem-weak> feel humor from solving math problems. This isn't surprising&mdash;since <sem>any</sem> kind of problem generates mistakes and lowers our OK.</p>
    
    <p>As we come to understand and eventually solve a problem, we shrink the mistake and raise our OK, and eventually they'll balance. This is true for bouldering, jokes, math problems, logic puzzles, box packing, riddles, way-finding, and so on&mdash;all of which generate humor for similar reasons.</p>
    
    <p>When we don't feel humor at math homework, it's because it's rote busywork to us, or because we're flailing through it. But when we're actually overcoming problems and gaining insight&mdash;when we're learning and incorporating new perspectives&mdash;we feel humor.</p>
