<p>Last chapter, we looked at how fitted humor and humor bushes together constituted our opinion of something. In this chapter, we'll look at how fitted humor and humor bushes are involved in learning.</p>

<p>Humor is how we learn—when we learn, we feel humor. More specifically, humor is the process of incorporating new perspectives or framings:</p> 

No humor shows no framings have been incorporated

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*lecturing*</action> <action>*reading off slides*</action> <speech>“Joseph Conrad who wasn’t actually a native speaker of English was one of the finest novelists in English literature and was famous for his maritime perspective and exploration of commercial and cultural systems that would later be called globalization…”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*thinking*</action> <speech>“This is so dull!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels no humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma doesn’t incorporate a new perspective)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*thinking*</action> <speech>“Wait—English wasn’t his first language?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe catches a mistake, but doesn’t have time or help to match it with an OK)</notes></p>

Emma?”</p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Uhh… not English?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“Right! Any guesses? Owen?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“… German?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“Good guess! But no!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin primes for an even bigger mistake)</notes> <action>*class is listening*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor tells like loss of situational awareness, social tightening, focusing on present)</notes> <speech>“It was Polish!

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“What do you think about that—Minh?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <speech>“Um. It’s surprising.”</speech> <action>*smiles sheepishly*</action> <notes>(&larr;Minh feels humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Minh incorporates a new perspective)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah. That would be like if someone in this room decided to start learning Polish today—and then went on to become the best Polish author in history!”</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <action>*class smiles and briefly chatter*</action> <notes>(&larr;class feels humor&harr;&#xFE0E;incorporates a new perspective)</notes></p>

<p>In order to effectively create new perspectives and framings in his students, Justin thinks of his teaching as a series of humor attempts. When he does this, he’s better able to acceptably criticize (perspectives), share new perspectives, support arguments, reveal personal views, and so on. 
    </p>

<p>This is why his successful teaching generates humor, while his unsuccessful teaching doesn’t.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <div class="considertext">When the class doesn’t feel humor, it’s a bit like pouring water over a stone—the potential new framings or perspectives just slide off them. When the class does feel humor, we know our class actually incorporated new framings. Humor is the process and expression of incorporating new framings.</div>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Learning.</headline> We don’t always notice the relation to humor and learning, in part because we don’t always notice humor outside of where we expect to find it.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, we don’t expect humor to be associated with math homework, and so don’t notice it—but once it’s pointed out, we do notice we feel humor from solving math problems. More specifically, we feel humor when we’re actually learning from the homework—and not just doing busywork or flailing through it.</p>
    
    <p>It's not surprising that we’d feel humor from a math problem. Any kind of problem sets up mistakes. As we work through mistakes, the mistake is eventually matched with an OK—which is why math problems and jokes generate humor for similar reasons.</p>
