<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>




<p>Last chapter, we looked at how fitted humor and humor bushes together constituted our opinion of something. In this chapter, we'll look at how fitted humor and humor bushes are involved in learning.</p>

<p>We can see the connection between humor and learning by seeing Justin leading a discussion in his class:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    
    <p><narration>Justin has been having his class read the classic novel Clouds over the Atlantic, and starts a discussion about the women’s suffrage movement. To prompt the class to think about universal suffrage, Justin asks the class whether they think sixteen-year-olds should be able to vote.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Most of the class doesn’t really have a strong opinion, but Trevor, who’s older than the rest of the undergraduates in the class, is appalled.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(appalled)</internalaction> <speech>“What? Sixteen-year-olds shouldn’t be able to vote!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(amused)</internalaction> <speech>“Why not?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“For a lot of reasons!"</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“What’s one?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“Well, for one, sixteen-year-olds aren’t responsible!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“So only responsible people should vote.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“I don’t know. Maybe.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“But responsibility is different than age, right? So if you’re concerned about ‘responsibility,’ why bring age into it?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“But age is a fairly applied proxy for responsibility…”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“Ah!”</speech> <internalaction>(friendly irony)</internalaction> <speech>“You know, if we changed the law to prevent people under forty from voting, that would be both fairly applied, and even better at removing more irresponsible voters. Do you think that’s a good idea?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Some of the class are amused.</narration> <notes>(&larr;class feel an argument has been supported)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <internalaction>(contrarily)</internalaction> <speech>“Maybe.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(amused)</internalaction> <speech>“What if I said you couldn’t vote, on the argument that I thought most people your age were irresponsible? That would be unfairly punishing you based on my general opinion of others.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“But that’s a totally different thing. I’m twenty-six. I have life experience. But sixteen-year-olds don’t even have mature brains. It’s just how things are.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(delighted)</internalaction> <speech>“So this circles back to women’s suffrage! In the 19th and 20th century, there never were coherent arguments against the expansion of voting rights. When a man said it was about responsibility, women would point out that not all men were responsible, but that many women were. So why bring gender into it? So in the end, the public arguments always rested on assumed biological factors, and the assumed importance of them.”</speech> *waving arms* <speech>“’Well, their brains aren’t right!’ End of argument.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>The class smiles.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels Justin supported an argument, shared a new perspective)</notes> <speech>“I think you’re twisting things. That’s a false analogy.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <action>*leans against desk*</action> <speech>“Maybe, maybe not! But it’s a useful analogy—Emma just mentioned that she couldn’t understand how so many men and women could be opposed to women’s suffrage. But we already can understand it, because we feel similar things today when we talk about letting sixteen-, thirteen-, ten-year-olds vote! We start relying on similar arguments, often because we feel that it’s ludicrous, we feel dread or a loss of control, that the social order will be upended—we say it’s unnecessary because of course the needs of sixteen-year-olds are already considered by eligible voters, that they are biologically in need civic caretakers. These feelings have been felt whenever the enfranchisement was about to expand—whether to men without property, Black men, or to women. So, Trevor, I know I was being a bit unfair back there—but I wanted to show that we can feel something similar to what anti-suffragettes felt back then. Emma, does that maybe help you understand their mindset more?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Emma shrugs and gives a half-smile. Some people in the class whisper to each other.</narration> <notes>(&larr;class expresses humor tells like expansive posture, relaxed posture, smiling, focusing on present, higher energy, social tightening, efforts to spread humor, and so on)</notes></p>

<p>Above, Justin helped his class tolerate and understand an additional framing of things—something that was made possible through fitted humor. Under the hood, Justin was treating this discussion as a humor attempt—he was introducing mistakes on active topics, and worked to shift them to match an OK.</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When we feel humor, we’re incorporating new perspectives. But just because we gain new perspectives doesn’t mean those perspectives will be important to us. Instead, the humor is just both the process and signal of noting, tolerating, and understanding new perspectives.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>If Justin’s class didn’t feel humor, they wouldn’t really be learning in a way that we’d characterize as insight, realization, revelation, and so on. We can see this when we imagine Justin’s class feeling the inverse of humor tells, humor family words, and humor outcomes:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <ul>If the class showed inverse humor tells, they would have low energy, tension, sluggish thinking, focus on the future (or past), pessimism, social avoidance, social fragmentation, formal behavior, disguising personal views, and so on.</ul>
     
    <ul>If the class showed inverse humor family words, then instead of feeling acceptance, they’d feel refusal; instead of accomplishment, failure; instead of appreciation, frustration; instead of insight, boredom, instead of realization, retrenchment; instead of relief, stress, and so on.</ul>
     
    <ul>If the class showed inverse humor outcomes, they’d feel that arguments have not been supported, tension has not been eased, new perspectives have not been given, complaints have not been handled, new topics of conversation have not been opened, conflict has not been avoided, and so on.</ul> 
    </ul>
    
<p>When a class has inverse humor tells, we have a variety of words to describe them—daydreaming, inattentive, lazy, listless, unenthusiastic, unmotivated, and so on. The more encompassing way of describing these classes is just that there’s a lack of fitted humor.
    </p>
    
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">Justin’s pre-existing humor bush with his class allowed the discussion to be successful, since that kind of discussion only works when the class has some rapport, some ability to reveal personal views, some ability to be acceptably criticized, some ability to handle complaints, and so on.</p>

<p class="considertext">Without this humor bush, the class will be uncooperative and uninterested. Trevor felt comfortable revealing a personal view and trying to acceptably criticize (an idea)—just like Justin felt comfortable handling Trevor’s criticism. This comfort was pre-established through a humor bush.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Memorization.</headline> Humor family words and humor outcomes are what distinguishes learning from something like memorization. For instance, we may have to memorize useless facts to pass a driver’s license examination. (“Begin braking at least 300 feet from a stop sign…”)</p> 
    
    <p>If we want, we can define this as “learning”—but at the same time, the experience of this memorization is different than when we feel an argument has been supported, new perspectives have been gained, other ideas have been acceptably criticized, complaints about other ideas have been handled, rapport has been created with us, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>When we feel humor on a topic, we’re learning about that topic—we learn by feeling humor. Fitted humor shows we feel acceptance, achievement, comfort, insight, realization, revelation, safety, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>In this way of thinking, we learn most when we set down the book and feel relief then we do when we're actually trying to commit abstract facts to memory.</p>
