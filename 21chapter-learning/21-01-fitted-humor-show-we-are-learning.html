<h2 id="exclude-navigation">Fitted humor marks learning</h2>

<p>We can see Justin leading a discussion in his class to see the connection between humor and learning:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    
    <p><narration>Justin's class has been reading the classic novel, <book-title>Clouds over the Atlantic</book-title>. Exploring the themes of the book, he starts a discussion about the women’s suffrage movement.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>To prompt the class to think about universal suffrage, Justin asks the class whether they think sixteen-year-olds should be able to vote.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Most of the class doesn’t really have a strong opinion, but Trevor, who’s older than the rest of the undergraduates in the class, is appalled.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(appalled)</internalaction> <speech>“What? Sixteen-year-olds shouldn’t be able to vote!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(amused)</internalaction> <speech>“Why not?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“For a lot of reasons!"</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“What’s one?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“Well, for one, sixteen-year-olds aren’t responsible!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“So only responsible people should vote.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“I don’t know. Maybe.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“But <term>responsibility</term> is different than <term2>age</term2>, right? So if you’re concerned about ‘responsibility,’ why bring age into it?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“But age is a fairly applied proxy for responsibility…”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“Ah!”</speech> <internalaction>(friendly irony)</internalaction> <speech>“You know, if we changed the law to prevent people under forty from voting, that would be both fairly applied, and even better at removing more irresponsible voters. Do you think that’s a good idea?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Some of the class are amused.</narration> <notes>(&larr;class feel an <humor-outcome>argument has been supported</humor-outcome>&larr;class incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;class learns&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <internalaction>(contrarily)</internalaction> <speech>“Maybe.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(amused)</internalaction> <speech>“What if I said <sem-weak>you</sem-weak> couldn’t vote, on the argument that I thought most people your age were irresponsible? That would be unfairly punishing you based on my general opinion of others.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“But that’s a totally different thing. I’m twenty-six. I have life experience. But sixteen-year-olds don’t even have mature <sem-weak>brains</sem-weak>. It’s just how things are.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(delighted)</internalaction> <speech>“So this circles back to <sem-weak>women’s</sem-weak> suffrage! In the 19th and 20th century, there never were coherent arguments against the expansion of voting rights. When a man said it was about responsibility, women would point out that not all men were responsible, but that many women were. So why bring gender into it? So in the end, the public arguments always rested on assumed biological factors, and the assumed importance of them.”</speech> <action>*waving arms*</action> <speech>“’Well, their <em>brains</em> aren’t right!’ End of argument.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>The class smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;class feel an <humor-outcome>argument has been supported</humor-outcome>&harr;&#xFE0E;class incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;class learns&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels Justin <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>shared a new perspective</humor-outcome>&harr;&#xFE0E;Trevor incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;Tervor learns&harr;&#xFE0E;humor))</notes> <speech>“I think you’re twisting things. That’s a false analogy.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <action>*leans against desk*</action> <speech>“Maybe, maybe not! But it’s a <sem-weak>useful</sem-weak> analogy&mdash;Emma just mentioned that she couldn’t understand how so many men and women could be opposed to women’s suffrage. But we already <em>can</em> understand it, because we feel similar things today when we talk about letting sixteen-, thirteen-, ten-year-olds vote! We start relying on similar arguments, often because we feel that it’s <sem-weak>ludicrous</sem-weak>, we feel <sem-weak>dread</sem-weak> or a <sem-weak>loss of control</sem-weak>, that the social order will be <sem-weak>upended</sem-weak>&mdash;we say it’s unnecessary because of course the needs of sixteen-year-olds are <sem-weak>already</sem-weak> considered by eligible voters, that they are <sem-weak>biologically</sem-weak> in need civic caretakers. These feelings have been felt <sem-weak>whenever</sem-weak> the franchisement was about to expand&mdash;whether to men without property, Black men, or to women. So, Trevor, I know I was being a bit unfair back there&mdash;but I wanted to show that we <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> feel something similar to what anti-suffragettes felt back then. Emma, does that maybe help you understand their mindset more?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Emma shrugs and gives a half-smile. Some people in the class whisper to each other.</narration> <notes>(&larr;class expresses humor tells like <emotion-tell>expansive posture</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>relaxed posture</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>smiling</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>focusing on present</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>higher energy</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>social tightening</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>efforts to spread humor</emotion-tell>, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;class incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;class learns&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
    
    </div>

<p>Above, Justin helped his class tolerate and understand additional framings of things&mdash;something that was made possible through fitted humor.</p> 

<p>Under the hood, Justin was treating this discussion as a humor attempt&mdash;he was introducing mistakes on active topics, and worked to shift them to match an OK.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When we feel humor, we’re incorporating new perspectives. But just because we <humor-outcome>gain new perspectives</humor-outcome> doesn’t mean those perspectives will be important to us. We incorporate new perspectives that we think are terrible all the time!</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Humor doesn't indicate quality or importance of a perspective. Instead, the humor is both the process and signal of noting, tolerating, and understanding new perspectives.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>If Justin’s class <outcome-contrast>didn’t</outcome-contrast> feel humor, they wouldn’t really be learning in a way that we’d characterize as <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>We can see this when we imagine Justin’s class feeling the <em>inverse</em> of humor tells, humor family words, and humor outcomes:</p>

<div class="list-in-text">
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>If the class showed <em>inverse</em> <strong>humor tells</strong>, they would have <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>low</outcome-contrast> energy</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>tension</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>sluggish</outcome-contrast> thinking</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>focus on the <outcome-contrast>future</outcome-contrast> (or past)</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>pessimism</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>social <outcome-contrast>avoidance</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>social <outcome-contrast>fragmentation</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>formal</outcome-contrast> behavior</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>disguising</outcome-contrast> personal views</emotion-tell>, and so on</li>.
         
        <li>If the class showed <em>inverse</em> <strong>humor family words</strong>, then instead of feeling <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, they’d feel <emotions><outcome-contrast>refusal</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>failure</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>frustration</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>boredom</outcome-contrast></emotions>, instead of <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>retrenchment</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>stress</outcome-contrast></emotions>, and so on.</li>
         
        <li>If the class showed <em>inverse</em> <strong>humor outcomes</strong>, they’d feel that <humor-outcome>arguments have <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>tension has <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been eased</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives have <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been given</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>criticisms have <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been handled</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new topics of conversation have <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been opened</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>conflict has <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been avoided</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
</div>
    
<p>We have a variety of words to describe a class with inverse humor tells&mdash;daydreaming, inattentive, lazy, listless, unenthusiastic, unmotivated, and so on. We can describe these classes in an encompassing way by simply saying these classes have a lack of fitted humor.
    </p>
    
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Justin’s discussion with the class was successful in part because he had a pre-existing humor bush with them. That kind of discussion works when the class has <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> ability to reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> ability to be acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> ability to handle complaints</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Trevor felt comfortable <humor-outcome>revealing a personal view</humor-outcome> and trying to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (an idea)</humor-outcome>&mdash;just like Justin felt comfortable <humor-outcome>handling Trevor’s criticism</humor-outcome>. This comfort was pre-established through a humor bush. Without this humor bush, the class will be uncooperative and uninterested.</p>
</div>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Concord.</headline> Before, we talked about how humor was the mechanism of <em>concordant</em> influence&mdash;with concord etymologically meaning  <callback>"hearts (moving) together."</callback></p> 
    
<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">
            Concordant influence <callback>(humor influence)</callback> was in-between coercive influence <callback>(mistake-predominant influence)</callback> and inertial influence <callback>(OK-predominant influence)</callback>
        </p>
   </div>

    
    <p>Concord is what makes humor outcomes humor outcomes. We can be <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>forced</outcome-contrast> to gain perspectives</humor-outcome> by touching a hot stove, or by memorizing pointless facts for a driver's license examination. These are coercive or inertial ways of "learning"&mdash;but in this book, there's only one concordant way to learn: humor.</p>      
    <p>Humor is how we feel an <humor-outcome>argument has been (concordantly) supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives have been (concordantly) gained</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>other ideas have been (concordantly) criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>complaints about other ideas have been (concordantly) handled</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>rapport has been (concordantly) created with us</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
        <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is reading a book about Aesopian fables.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><narration>A trumpeter marches into battle in the vanguard of an army, and uses his music to instill his comrades with courage. But in the course of battle, the trumpeter is captured and taken prisoner. Later, a council is assembled to decide what to do with the prisoners.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Trumpeter:</speaker> <action>*begging*</action> <speech>"Do not put me to death. Not only have I not killed anyone, I don't even have any weapons! I carry with me only my trumpet."</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Council:</speaker> <speech>"That is only the more reason why we should take your life. For though you did not fight yourself, you stirred up others to do so."</speech></p>

    <p class="vig-or">- OR -</p>
    
<p>
      <narration>  Zoe frowns. Killing seems so severe here. She prefers the animal fables that have a more abstract feeling to them.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> incorporate new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe <outcome-contrast>doesn't</outcome-contrast> learn&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
  </p>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>It's this concord that produces feeling of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on, which constitute the mechanism of accepting a flow into new perspectives, outside of coercion or inertia.</p>
