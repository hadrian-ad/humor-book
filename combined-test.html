       <p class="overtitle">Humor is an Emotion</p>
       
</div>
    

    
    <p>
        Humor is an <vocab>emotion</vocab>. We can add this into our model:
    </p>
    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is an <i>emotion</i> that occurs when a mistake is evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    <p>
        We usually think of things like <emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>happiness</emotions>, <emotions>sadness</emotions>, and so on as emotions—but we don’t always think of <emotions>humor</emotions> explicitly as an emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
        But humor behaves just like other emotions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We can feel <emotions>humor</emotions> grow over time, like over the course of a funny story—in the same way we can feel <emotions><outcome-contrast>anger</outcome-contrast></emotions> grow over time, like over the course of an infuriating story.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have physical reactions when we feel <emotions>humor</emotions>, like smiles or laughs—in the same way we have physical reactions when we feel <emotions><outcome-contrast>sadness</outcome-contrast></emotions>, like sighing or tears.
        </li>
        <li>
            We sometimes have bursts of unexpected <emotions>humor</emotions>, which seem to come out of nowhere—in the same way we sometimes have bursts of unexpected <emotions><outcome-contrast>grief</outcome-contrast></emotions> or <emotions><outcome-contrast>irritation</outcome-contrast></emotions>, which seem to come out of nowhere.
        </li>
        <li>
            <emotions>Humor</emotions> has dimensions of intensity and duration to it—in the same way <emotions><outcome-contrast>sadness</outcome-contrast></emotions> or <emotions><outcome-contrast>anger</outcome-contrast></emotions> has dimensions of intensity and duration to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Babies go through periods of <emotions>humor</emotions>—in the same way they go through periods of <emotions><outcome-contrast>boredom</outcome-contrast></emotions> or <emotions><outcome-contrast>irritation</outcome-contrast></emotions>.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are videos oriented around making us feel <emotions>humor</emotions>—in the same way there are videos oriented around making us feel <emotions><outcome-contrast>anger</outcome-contrast></emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>“aww,”</outcome-contrast></emotions> <emotions><outcome-contrast>amazement</outcome-contrast></emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>empowerment</outcome-contrast></emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>fear</outcome-contrast></emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>frustration</outcome-contrast></emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>mystery</outcome-contrast></emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>grief</outcome-contrast></emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>sadness</outcome-contrast></emotions>, and so on.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">
        (and so on)
    </p>
    <p>
        Since humor behaves similarly to things like anger and sadness, we’ll be calling humor an emotion.
    </p>
    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is an <i>emotion</i> that occurs when a mistake is evaluated as OK.
    </p>

    

<div class="box">   
      <p><headline>Demystifying humor.</headline> Sometimes, without really thinking about it, we put humor into its own category:
        </p>
<img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-0-images/2-0-1-humor-excluded.png" title="Humor excluded" style="max-width: 18rem;"
        
        alt="This diagram shows humor as somewhere outside a cluster of what we typically think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, shame.">
        <p>
            If humor’s separated from everything else, it becomes mysterious or hard to think about. But it’s less mysterious once we put similar things together:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-0-images/2-0-2-humor-included.png"
        style="max-width: 11rem;"
        title="Humor included"
        
        alt="This diagram evolves the previous diagram by putting humor in the same cluster of what we typically think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, shame."
        
        style="max-width: 13rem;">
        <p>
            By plugging humor into our existing understanding of our emotional lives, we’ll have a greater intuitive understanding of humor.

<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Our model requires a person</h1>
<!--    02.10 -->

<p>Since humor is an emotion, a <vocab>specific person</vocab> feels humor. Different people may feel different things—so one person may feel <emotions>humor</emotions>, while someone else may feel something else:</p>
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Xiaowei is dropping his friend Lina off at their high school for the opening day of her play.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <speech>"Break a leg! Also: You look nervous as hell!"</speech></p>
        <p><narration>Lina gives him the finger on the way out.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Lina does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel humor)</notes> <narration>Xiaowei laughs and gives the finger back.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Xiaowei feels humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Elias stops by to give Jessica and Emma a ride, but Jessica is running a bit behind. When she finally comes out of the bathroom, Elias makes a belittling comment about the slogan on Jessica’s shirt.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Elias feels humor)</notes></p>
        <p><narration>It makes Jessica laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels humor)</notes> <narration>It makes Emma furious.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Bleary-eyed from staying up late, Zoe starts giggling.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels humor)</notes> <narration>Emma puts her head in her hands.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(despairing)</internalaction> <speech>“We’ll never finish,”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Amber visits Jennifer, and laughs at the cat wedged in a cardboard box.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Amber feels humor)</notes></p> 
        
        <p><narration>But Jennifer has seen the cat there so often, she no longer notices anything.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Since these outcomes are different for each person, we’ll need to be thoughtful about which perspective we’re looking at:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">    
            <li>Humor is an emotion <term>Xiaowei</term> feels when <em>he</em> evaluates a mistake as OK.</li>
            
        <li>Humor is an emotion <term>Yasmin</term> feels when <em>she</em> evaluates a mistake as OK.</li>
            
            <li>Humor is an emotion <term>Jessica</term> feels when <em>she</em> evaluates a mistake as OK.</li>
            
            <li>Humor is an emotion <term>Zoe</term> feels when <em>she</em> evaluates a mistake as OK.</li>
            
            <li>Humor is an emotion <term>Amber</term> feels when <em>she</em> evaluates a mistake as OK.
                </li>  </ul>
           
    <p>Because of this, we can update our model:</p>
    <p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion that <i>someone</i> feels when <i>they</i> evaluate a mistake as OK.</p>
              
                         
    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">
    Humor is just one possible emotional outcome
</h1>
    <p>Last chapter, we looked at evaluations as leading to either <emotions>humor</emotions> or <outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> <emotions> humor</emotions>:

                                      <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor and jokes aren't the same thing</h1>
   
    <p>Sometimes we think of jokes and humor as the same thing. But they're not—for the same reason insults and <emotions>anger</emotions> are different.</p>
    <p>“Insult” makes us think of a comment, while “<emotions>anger</emotions>” makes us think of an emotion:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-3-images/2-3-0-anger-insult.png" title="Insults and anger are different" alt="This venn diagram shows two circles: insult (comment) and anger (emotion)" 
    style="max-width: 20rem;">
    
    <p>Insults and <emotions>anger</emotions> sometimes coincide, but they're distinct things. There can be insults without <emotions>anger</emotions>, just like there can be <emotions>anger</emotions> without insults:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-3-images/2-3-1-anger-insult-overlap.png" title="Insults and anger sometimes overlap, but are distinct" alt="This venn diagram shows that the two circles, insult (comment) and anger (emotion), sometimes intersect but they don't always. There are insults that don't involve anger, just like there is anger that don't involve insults."
    
    style="max-width: 18rem;">
    
    <p>It’s the same thing for jokes and <emotions>humor</emotions>. They sometimes coincide—but they’re distinct things. There can be jokes without <emotions>humor</emotions>, and <emotions>humor</emotions> without jokes:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-3-images/2-3-2-humor-joke-overlap.png" title="Jokes and humor are different" alt="This venn diagram shows has an analagous set-up to the previous diagrams, this time using joke (comment) as one category, and humor (emotion) as the other. These sometimes intersect, but don't always."
    
    style="max-width: 20rem;">


    <p>The complication is that we sometimes call jokes “humor.” In this case, we have the same-sounding word for <sem>both</sem> comments and emotions. There's humor and <emotions>humor</emotions>:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-3-images/2-3-3-humor-humor-overlap.png" title="Humor (comment) and humor (emotion) are different" alt="This venn diagram shows how the humor (comment) category and the humor (emotion) category don't always intersect."
    
    style="max-width: 20rem;">

    
        <p>This can make us think of these two things as more similar than they are. But humor <callback>(comment)</callback> and <emotions>humor</emotions> <callback>(emotion)</callback> aren’t the same thing—for the same reason insults and <emotions>anger</emotions> aren’t the same thing!</p>
    
                                       
<h1 id="exclude-navigation">"Humor" refers to an emotion</h1>
   
     <p>Humor is a broad word in our day-to-day conversations. At different times, we use the word “humor” to refer to a kind of:</p>
<ul class="close-list">
    <li><strong>comment</strong> <callback>(compliment, insult, <strong>humor</strong>, question, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>genre</strong> <callback>(drama, horror, <strong>humor</strong>, thriller, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>personality trait</strong> <callback>(gentleness, <strong>humor</strong>, temper, thoughtfulness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>quality</strong> <callback>(aggressive, beauty, <strong>humor</strong>, meanness, persuasiveness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>emotion</strong> <callback>(anger, <strong>humor</strong>, listlessness, sadness, and so on)</callback></li></ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>We see this fluidity of meaning all the time:</p>
    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe and Emma do a double take on a joke scribbled on a white board.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(disapprovingly)</internalaction> <speech>“Distasteful humor.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a comment or joke)</notes></p></div>
    
    <div class="vignette"><p><speaker>Amber:</speaker> <action>*to clerk*</action> <speech>“Hey, excuse me, I’m looking for the new Gram Bridgette book—is that in the memoir or humor section?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a genre)</notes></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Owen fills out his dating profile.</narration> 
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“The most important quality in a partner? Humor. For sure.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a trait)</notes> <action>*checks box*</action></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Timothy takes his residents on rounds.</narration></p> 
    <p><speaker>Timothy:</speaker> <speech>“Having a humorous name like Dr. Ailes is usually a good icebreaker.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a quality)</notes></p> 
    <p><narration>The residents chuckle loudly.</narration></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Emma goes to Zoe’s house for Thanksgiving. Everyone laughs a lot.</narration></p> 
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(pleased)</internalaction> <speech>“There’s a lot of humor at your house!”</speech>  <notes>(&larr;“humor” as an emotion)</notes> </p></div>

    <p>Most of the time, this fluidity of meaning is a source of utility and rich meaning. But at the same time, if we're not careful, this fluidity can also cause us unnecessary confusion.</p> 
    <p>We'll avoid this confusion by <sem>only</sem> using "humor" to refer to an emotion in this book.
     
       <div class="consider">  
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">There’s nothing wrong with other ways we define or use the word humor. But it <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> be wrong to be inconsistent in how we're using the word "humor." We don't want to mean one thing by "humor" in one sentence, and another thing the next.</p>  
        
        <p class="considertext">       
        So this book will stick consistently to one definition of humor, which will prevent us from flipping back and forth between meanings.

  We'll focus on humor, not genres

<p>
	Instead of talking about humor, we sometimes drift into talking about "farces," "jokes," "irony," and so on instead. But this can distract us from understanding why we sometimes laugh, and why we sometimes don’t. 
</p>
<p>
	Like anything else, comedies, farces, jokes, irony, satires, witty remarks, and so on <sem>can</sem> generate <emotions>humor</emotions>—but they don’t always. Someone may or may not see mistakes in them, which they may or may not evaluate as OK:

<p>
	So while our evaluations of jokes, comedies, wittiness, satire, and so on <term>can</term> lead to humor—our evaluations can <em>also</em> lead to any other emotion as well:

<p>
	Since we’re focusing on humor in this book, we won’t focus on jokes or satire—since those things aren’t humor. Humor is a particular emotional outcome&mdash;and we'll stay focused on why this outcome is or isn't reached.
</p>

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">
	Consider:</p>
<p class="considertext">
	We'll be learning why <sem-weak>anything</sem-weak> does or doesn't lead to an outcome of humor. This is inclusive to jokes and satire—but inclusive to everything else besides. We won't need to focus on jokes to understand humor.</p> 
	
    </div>
    

 <div class="box">    

<p><headline>Jokes and tentpoles.</headline> We sometimes idiomatically use “joke” as a tentpole word for humor—where everything that causes us to laugh is called a joke. But just because we have idiomatic ways of talking doesn't mean we should take those expressions at face value. <callback>("Everything we laugh at is a joke.")</callback></p>
    
<p>It's easy to see why we shouldn't take this literally. The reasoning would go like this:  <callback>"we sometimes laugh at jokes. Therefore <sem>everything</sem> we laugh at is some kind of joke."</callback> To see this as bizarre, we can create new variations: <callback>"we sometimes buy coffee. Therefore, <sem>everything</sem> we buy is some kind of coffee.”</callback></p>

 <p>For the same reason it would be strange to frame all <term>buying</term> around <term>coffee</term>—it would be strange to frame all <em>laughing</em> around <em>jokes</em>.</p>

Small amounts of humor matter
</h1>
<!--    02.60 -->

<p>
	Sometimes, we only notice humor when it’s unambiguous and most of our emotional state—like when we’re laughing at a movie:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Emma and Owen are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title>.</narration></p> 
	
	<p><narration>Chief is hired to work at a warehouse, but his attempt to move crates of lobsters goes horribly, horribly wrong. Emma and Owen laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;only humor)</notes>

    style="max-width: 17rem;">
       
<p>
	Even though we sometimes seem to feel “one” emotion, most emotions happen in a mix—like when Jennifer feels humor and anger in her emotional state: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Jennifer looks up from her tablet. Where’s Riley? Her heart sinks in fear. She checks the street, then runs around the house. She sees Riley squatting quietly next to an anthill, and Jennifer puts a hand over her heart and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>

   style="max-width: 24rem;">

<p>
	Above, Jennifer isn’t feeling humor and anger in equal proportions—instead, she feels a lot of humor and a small amount of anger in her emotional state. 
</p>
<p>
	We can see this in other examples as well:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Trevor walks into class and trips, and the cereal he’s carrying falls down his shirt.</narration></p>

	In complicated emotional states,  small amounts of humor mingle with more prominent feelings of bitterness, disappointment, sadness, and so on:

	Most of the humor we feel in our lives isn’t unadulterated humor. Instead, most of the humor we feel is just small twinges of humor, often as part of more complicated emotional moments.
</p>

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">
	Consider:
</p>
<p class="considertext">
	Small amounts of humor matter to how we describe our emotional state. This is like how an all-blue panel is very different than a similar panel with an orange dot in the middle.</p>
<img class="img-indent" src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-6-images/2-6-7-blue.png" title="Comparison of blue boxes" alt="Two blue squares are contrasted, one all-blue and the other all-blue with an orange dot in it."

style="max-width: 14rem;">

<p class="considertext">
We'd be suspicious of someone who insisted the orange wasn't relevant, simply because both are <sem2>mostly</sem2> blue. The overall composition matters, not just the majority color.</p>

<p class="considertext">
	It's the same for our emotional state. For similar reasons, we can't just ignore small amounts of humor and still be accurate to our experiences. 
	
</p>

</div>

 <div class="box">    
		<p><headline>Brownies and importance.</headline> Sometimes we assume that the more <term>intense</term> an emotion is, the more that emotion <em>matters</em>—like that a twinge of humor wouldn't matter much if it happens alongside much more intense anger. We may even think we don’t even need to account for that humor at all.</p>
	<p>
		But we can use a comparison to food to see that that isn’t quite right. If we eat an orange-zest brownie, we wouldn’t say the orange-zest is unimportant just because chocolate is by far the most prominent flavor. And we definitely wouldn't say we <sem-weak>only</sem-weak> taste chocolate.</p>
		
	<p>
		It’s the same for our emotions. We can't ignore small amounts of humor, since that flavors the entire experience. That’s why this book will be as inclusive of these small twinges of humor as it will be to intense moments of humor.

<div class="content-example">
   
   <p>This book's instigating source was Warren Shibles' <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;which is without a doubt one of the strangest books ever written.</p>
 
  <p>Shibles was an autistic philosopher who wrote prolifically on topics of love, humor, emotions, lies, metaphor, death, ethics, time, and more&mdash;and made almost no impression on anyone at all.</p>
          
   <p>An exception would be the author of this book&mdash;who ran into <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> as a teenager and thereafter became unescapably interested in humor. From this ususual starting place, the next decade and a half was spent taking notes on smiles and laughs and pondering it all.</p> 
          
      
    <p>The author is indebted to Shibles' ideas, as well as the example he set in terms of clarity and independence of thought. While much of this book is something the author incubated over a long time, it certainly would not exist without Shibles' book and pioneering self-publishing efforts.</p>
           
    <p>Finally, this book also takes his approach to "philosophical psychology"&mdash;learning about the world by organizing our experiences in a way that's both coherent and penetrating.</p>
     
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">The alternative is to think we need something to justify our own observations, like clinical psychology or evolutionary biology&mdash;essentially a pole we knot one end of our thinking too.</p>
            
        <p class="considertext">As useful as that is in some contexts, that can be overapplied. This is usually obvious to us in other areas&mdash;if we want to watch video essays on how beautiful movies are composed, it's often enough that they simply talk about movies.</p>
             </div> 
             
   <p>Outside of Shibles, the nutrients for this book came from a broad range of books and experiences. While these were generally not specifically about humor, many of them provide important clues and indications to the bigger story of humor&mdash;something we'll be talking about as we go through this book.</p>
