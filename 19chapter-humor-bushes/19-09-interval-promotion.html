    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">13. Evaluatory information</h1>



Moment of humor have both intensity and fittedness. Sometimes we prioritize fittedness (charm) and sometimes we prioritize intensity (comedy)—and these priorities shape how we judge humor.



But sometimes we prioritize another measure: status. When we prioritize status (promotion), we start judging humor as good or bad in sometimes strange ways:

 

Owen sees Zoe smile as she reads a paperback romance she got at the public library. (&larr;Zoe feels humor) Owen looks at the cover. There’s a dark-haired duke on a castle balcony with a sunset behind him.

Owen: *thinking* “Lame.” (&larr;Owen prioritizes a measure of status, even over his observation of Zoe’s humor)





 

Owen flips through the book and finds himself amused at the dialogue between the haughty Duke and the spirited new royal horse trainer. (&larr;Owen feels humor) Embarrassed that he’s enjoying himself, Owen puts it back. (&larr;Owen prioritizes a measure of status, even over his own humor)



Owen felt humor himself, and he saw Zoe feel humor—which means the novel had decent intensity, fittedness, or both. It’s not until Owen gives primacy to his own ideas about status that he decides that it’s “bad” humor.

There are a few problems with prioritizing status—like that status is somewhat tangential to the experience—a bit like judging someone’s cooking by how much we like their kitchen decor.

Another problem is that status is often entirely in our own heads—Owen is probably the only one of his social circle who worries that tolerating or briefly enjoying a romance novel is status-decreasing. 

This means Owen prioritizes his status for an audience of one: he’s essentially trying to impress himself!

> Consider:

If we get into a habit of prioritizing personal ideas about status, even when no one cares, we can develop a strange relation to humor. 

 

We find people who prioritize status over fittedness or intensity to be dull, excruciating, narrow, self-serving, socially insecure, uncurious, uninteresting, and so on—just like others think about us, when we prioritize status ourselves!

The point isn’t that Owen should read books he doesn’t want to. Instead, the point is that he doesn’t need to have a backlash against himself for simply enjoying paging through a book—and he doesn’t need to look down on Zoe for enjoying what she enjoys. Owen would be judging her based on his own ideas of status—which doesn’t really accomplish anything.

Owen doesn’t gain anything by prioritizing status when around Zoe—but he and Zoe do gain something when he doesn’t prioritize status. If Owen feels humor when Zoe feels humor, they can grow a mutual humor bush:

 

Owen: (sincerely) *smiling* “Looks like a fun book!”

Zoe: *smiles* “It is fun.” (&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)

- OR -
Owen: *smiling* “Good book?”

Zoe: *smiles* “Shameless.” (&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)

- OR -
 Owen: *smiling* “The dialogue in this book is outrageous!”

Zoe: *smiles* “Isn’t it?!” (&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)

Mutual humor increases their ability to mutually characterize their relationship with mutual humor family words. When around each other, Zoe and Owen often feel acceptance, connection, belonging, delight, generosity, welcome, and so on. They grow a humor bush, and Owen will accrue greater respect from the people around him.

> Consider:

Owen gains respect by equal-ranking Zoe, which is what accrues respect. He'd be treating Zoe the way he would want to be treated himself—since Owen wouldn’t want her to feel condescension toward him for enjoying what he enjoyed, or for her to feel shame for briefly enjoying something he enjoyed.

If Owen doesn’t equal-rank others, and prioritizes his personal ideas of status over everything else, he’ll have to live with an internal censor in his head—one that’s constantly screening his humor for status; fighting against moments of humor; and prompting feelings of anger or guilt. This can pointlessly curtail the range and vividness of his experiences and relationships—without any benefit.
