    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor bush is average amount of humor felt over time</h1>

<p>A humor bushes can track the cumulative amount of humor we feel <term>generally</term>, but we can also think of the cumulative amount of humor we have <em>specifically</em>&mdash;we can think of <sem>individual topics</sem> as having a humor bush too.</p>

<p>For instance, when Zoe’s topic ‘taking the bus’ is active, the topic tracks the average humor felt over time:</p>

<p>Humor bushes are useful when we want to think about humor over a various time scales—so not just the average humor Zoe feels over <term>two minutes</term> as she boards the bus, but also the average humor she's felt over <em>several years</em> of riding the busses near campus.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We can segment humor bushes by smaller topics too&mdash;like by breaking down 'taking the bus' into 'taking route 11' and 'taking route 47.' These smaller topics will have their own humor bushes.</p>
        
    <p class="considertext">If route 11 is always crowded and she has to stand, while she gets to sit with Emma on route 47, 'taking route 47' will have a larger humor bush than 'taking route 11.'</p> </div>
