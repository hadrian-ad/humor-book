    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor bush is average amount of humor felt over time</h1>

<p>A humor bushes can track the cumulative amount of humor we feel <term>generally</term>, but we can also think of the cumulative amount of humor we have <em>specifically</em>&mdash;we can think of <sem>individual topics</sem> as having a humor bush too.</p>

<p>For instance, when Zoe’s topic ‘taking the bus’ is active, the topic tracks the average humor felt over time:</p>

<p>Humor bushes are useful when we want to think about humor over a various time scales—so not just the average humor Zoe feels over <term>two minutes</term> as she boards the bus, but also the average humor she's felt over <em>several years</em> of riding the busses near campus.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">When we think about different topics having their own humor bushes, we can compare them.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">For instance, if we seperate the topic 'taking the bus' into topics for different bus routes, we'll be able to order those topics by size of humor bush.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If Zoe has to stand on a crowded bus when she takes route 11, 'route 11' will have a small humor bush. But if she takes route 43 with Emma on their way to their favorite class, 'route 43' may have a large humor bush.</p> </div>
