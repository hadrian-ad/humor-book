<p>All emotions have emotion bushes. Below, Jennifer can grow a <term>humor</term> bush or an <em>anger</em> bush:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Jennifer sees Riley tugging on an old fence post.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <speech>"Oh, don’t do that, Riley—if it falls over... SPLAT!!"</speech> <action>*tapping Riley’s head*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Riley:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <speech>"So don't do it any more, okay?"</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Riley:</speaker> <speech>“Okay.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer grows the humor bush in her relationship with Riley)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>

    <p><narration>Jennifer sees Riley tugging on a post.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*snapping*</action> <speech>“Don’t do that!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Riley stops. </narration><notes>(&larr;Jennifer grows the <outcome-contrast>anger</outcome-contrast> bush in her relationship with Riley)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
<p>In both examples, Jennifer reaches her short-term goal of stopping Riley from fiddling with the post—but she does so by growing different emotion bushes.</p>

<p>The size of an emotion bush is the average amount of that emotion over time. To find the humor bush or anger bush, we’d take this one moment of humor or anger with Riley—along with every other moment of humor or anger. This lets us find the average size of a particular emotion bush.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">While “emotion bush” a new phrase, the idea is familiar—because we already track emotion bushes! It's why we can make an ordered list of who irritates us the most at work <callback>(comparing size of anger bushes)</callback>, just like we can intuitively order extended relatives by how much humor they help us feel <callback>(comparing size of humor bushes)</callback>.</p>
     
    
    <p class="considertext">We can do this is because we always have a comparative sense of how much humor—or any emotion—we’ve felt toward someone overall.</p>
