<p>Different relationships have different sizes of humor bushes. For instance, Trevor and his twelve-year-old nephew Sebastian have a small humor bush:</p>


<p>Since they only have a small humor bush, we’d characterize their overall relationship as having some rapport, low-ish tension, control of the situation mostly in the hands of the one with more status, some petty conflict, and so on.</p>

   <div class="consider"> 
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t necessarily what happens moment-to-moment. Sometimes Trevor and Sebastian mutually feel intense humor. We’d use stronger intensities of humor outcomes to characterize them in that particular moment—“in this moment, they feel strong rapport.”</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">But overall, if they only occasionally feel humor around each other, we’d characterize their relationship with low-intensity humor outcomes.</p>
</div>

<p>By contrast, Emma and Zoe have a large humor bush:</p>



<p>In this case, we’d characterize their overall relationship as having full rapport, no tension, able to mutually control situations, never in conflict, and so on.</p>
