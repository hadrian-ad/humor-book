    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">Relationships are characterized by the size of a humor bush</h2>



<p>Different relationships have different sizes of humor bushes. For instance, Trevor and his twelve-year-old nephew Sebastian have a <sem-weak>small</sem-weak> humor bush:</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>Since they only have a small humor bush, we’d characterize their overall relationship as <humor-outcome>having <outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>low-ish </outcome-contrast>tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>control of the situation mostly in the hands of the one with <outcome-contrast>more status</outcome-contrast></humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some petty</outcome-contrast> conflict</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

   <div class="consider"> 
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t necessarily what happens moment-to-moment. Sometimes Trevor and Sebastian mutually feel intense humor. We’d use stronger intensities of humor outcomes to characterize them in that particular <term>moment</term>&mdash;<callback>“in this moment, they feel strong rapport.”</callback></p>
    
    <p class="considertext">But if they only <sem-weak>occasionally</sem-weak> feel intense mutual humor around each other, we’d characterize their <em>overall</em> relationship with low-intensity humor outcomes&mdash;<callback>"in general, they feel some rapport"</callback></p>
</div>

<p>By contrast, Emma and Zoe have a <sem-weak>large</sem-weak> humor bush:</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left: " 
     >



<p>In this case, we’d characterize their overall relationship as <humor-outcome>having <outcome-contrast>full</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>able to <outcome-contrast>mutually</outcome-contrast> control situations</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> in conflict</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="considertext">
 Humor is the mechanism of concordant influence&mdash;which means a humor bush is a measure of concord.</p> 
    
      <p class="considertext">When people together <humor-outcome>have <outcome-contrast>full</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>are able to <outcome-contrast>mutually</outcome-contrast> control situations</humor-outcome>, and so on&mdash;they have a high degree of overall concord.
