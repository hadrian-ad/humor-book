<p>So far, we’ve mostly been looking at how we'd describe <term>single</term> instances of humor. In this chapter, we’ll be looking at a longer timescale—how we’d describe <em>many</em> moments of humor.</p>

<p>For instance, over a given  period, we might have one instance of fitted humor—or dozens:</p>

    alt="This image introduces humor bush diagrams. These are circles representing time, with dots in them representing moments of fitted humor. There is one circle with one dot, labeled 'one moment of fitted humor over time' and another circle with many dots labeled 'many moments of fitted humor over time.'";
    title="Humor bush diagram I";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: 1rem;" 
     >
      

<p>We’ll call this humor over time a <vocab>humor bush</vocab>:</p>

 <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-00-humor-bushes/19-00-1-humor-bush-big.png

    alt="This image extends the diagram by adding a drawing of a bush. This is placed underneath a circle of time with dots of fitted humor in it. The bush represents that circle, and is labeled 'humor bush'.";
    title="Humor bush diagram II";
    style="max-width: 11rem; margin-left: 1rem;" 
     >

<p>Humor bushes can be large or small, depending on how many instances of humor we have with someone over time:</p>

 <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-00-humor-bushes/19-00-2-humor-bush-small.png

    alt="This image extends the diagram by adding a second bush for a second circle. A circle of time with few dots of fitted humor in it get a drawing of a small humor bush, while a circle of time with many dots of fitted humor in it gets a drawing of a large humor bush.";
    title="Humor bush diagram III";
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left:1rem; " 
     >

<p>Humor bushes can change over time. If the proportion of humor to time grows, the humor bush grows:</p> 

 <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-00-humor-bushes/19-00-3-humor-bush-change.png

    alt="This image extends the diagram by connecting the two circles with an arrow representing time. The circle fills up with fitted humor moments, and the humor bush gets larger. An annotation says humor bushes cchange in size over time.";
    title="Humor bush diagram IV";
    style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left:1rem; " 
     >

<p>We’ll be talking about humor bushes throughout this chapter.</p>
