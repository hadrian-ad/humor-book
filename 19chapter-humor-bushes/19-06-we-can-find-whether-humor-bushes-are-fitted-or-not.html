    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">Humor bushes are fitted by need for concord</h2>


<p>Humor bushes are fitted within different ranges for any pair of people&mdash;so not just between us and our romantic partner and our students, but also between us and our:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>corrections officer</li>
    <li>food vendor</li>
    <li>lifting buddy</li>
    <li>professor we’re working for</li>
    <li>adolescent child’s romantic partner</li>
    <li>social media audience</li>
    <li>medical specialist</li>
    <li>homeless patron</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>In each of these relationships, there’s both a humor dress code for <term>specific</term> instances&mdash;<callback>“is this <outcome-contrast>specific</outcome-contrast> humor attempt fitted?”</callback>&mdash;as well as a humor dress code for humor in <term2>general</term2>&mdash;<callback>“is this <outcome-contrast>overall</outcome-contrast> amount of humor fitted?”</callback></p>

<p>To find humor bush dress codes, we take our humor outcomes one-by-one. For each one, we’d think about what degree of characterization would be fitted or unfitted.</p>

<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We’d ask <callback>“to what degree should we characterize our relationship with our doctor (or neighbor, lover, trainer, or so on) with a humor outcome? Should we <humor-outcome>&lt;never&#47;occasionally&#47;often&#47;always&gt; symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>?"</callback></p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">So with our life partner we may think we should <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>always</outcome-contrast> symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>. With our neighbor, just <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>often</outcome-contrast> symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>. With our doctor, just <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>occasionally</outcome-contrast> symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>. This characterization of fitted <vocab>frequency</vocab> helps us think about the fittedness of humor bushes.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Then we’d go through other humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on. As we go through each humor outcome, we’ll arrive at an intuitive sense of what would be too much or too little.</p>

<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Standards.</headline> The humor dress code is set by our need for efficiency and cohesion&mdash;which is true for <term>individual</term> moments of humor as well as for <term2>collective</term2> moments of humor.</p> 
           
        <p>We can use efficiency and cohesion to think about the humor dress code for humor bushes. How much efficiency and cohesion do we need with our coworkers or clients&mdash;not just in specific moments, but <em>overall?</em> How would the humor bush dress code change when someone stops being our client, and we just become friends?</p>    
     
        <p>We can often think about the humor dress code of groups or places. We can ask: <callback>“how cohesive and effective does a tour bus have to be?”</callback>&mdash;or a classroom, waiting room, or so on. This can help us estimate the upper <weak-sem>and</weak-sem> lower ranges for the dress code of humor bushes.</p>
