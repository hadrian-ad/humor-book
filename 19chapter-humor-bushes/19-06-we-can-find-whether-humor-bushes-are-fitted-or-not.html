    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can find whether humor bushes are fitted or unfitted</h1>


<p>We can think about what the range of fitted humor bushes are for any pair of people—not just between us and our romantic partner and our students, but also between us and our:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>corrections officer</li>
    <li>food vendor</li>
    <li>lifting buddy</li>
    <li>professor we’re working for</li>
    <li>adolescent child’s romantic partner</li>
    <li>social media audience</li>
    <li>medical specialist</li>
    <li>homeless patron</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>In each of these relationships, there’s both a humor dress code for <term>specific</term> instances—<callback>“is this <outcome-contrast>specific</outcome-contrast> humor attempt fitted?”</callback>—as well as a humor dress code for humor in <em>general</em>—<callback>“is this <outcome-contrast>overall</outcome-contrast> amount of humor fitted?”</callback></p>

<p>To find humor bush dress codes, we can take our humor outcomes one-by-one. For each one, we’d think about what degree of characterization would be fitted or unfitted.</p>

<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We’d ask <callback>“to what degree should we characterize our relationship with our doctor (or neighbor, lover, or so on)? Should we &lt;never / occasionally / often / always&gt; symbolize close ties?"</callback></p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">So with our lover we may think we should <outcome-contrast>always</outcome-contrast> symbolize close ties. With our neighbor, just <outcome-contrast>often</outcome-contrast>. With our doctor, just <outcome-contrast>occasionally</outcome-contrast>. This characterization of fitted <sem>frequency</sem> helps us think about the fittedness of humor bushes.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Then we’d go through other humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on. As we go through each humor outcome, we’ll arrive at an intuitive sense of what would be too much or too little.</p>
    </div>
 

 

<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Standards.</headline> The humor dress code is set by our need for efficiency and cohesion—which is true for individual moments of humor as well as for humor bushes. We can use this to think about the humor dress code for humor bushes, especially for groups.
        </p>
        
    <p>We do this by asking <callback>“how cohesive and effective does a tour bus have to be?”</callback>—or a classroom, waiting room, or so on. This can help us estimate the upper and lower ranges for the dress code of humor bushes.</p>
    
    <p>It also helps us think about how this changes overtime. The dress code for a humor bush will change when someone stops being our client, and we start becoming friends outside of any commercial relation—since our need for efficiency and cohesion changes.</p>
