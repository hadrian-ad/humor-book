<p>While we’ve been thinking about a relationship between people as having one humor bush, there’s really two humor bushes involved—a humor bush for each person in the relationship. That’s because not everyone feels humor equally.</p>

<p>For instance, Trevor makes his twelve-year-old nephew <term>Sebastian</term> feel a lot of humor, but Sebastian rarely makes <em>Trevor</em> feel humor.</p>

 

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“Hey, do you want to watch me play StormConQuest?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Sebastian:</speaker> <action>*tries to hide delight and wonder*</action> <speech>“Yes!”</speech> <action>*runs to den*</action> <notes>(&larr;Trevor often makes Sebastian feel humor)</notes></p>

<p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
<p><speaker>Sebastian:</speaker> (nervous) <speech>“Um, do you want to watch me play StormConQuest?"</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> *checks phone* <speech>“Not right now. Maybe later, okay?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sebastian rarely makes Trevor feel humor)</notes></p> 


<p>Over time, this leads to <term>asymmetric</term> humor bushes:</p>

<p>When there are asymmetric humor bushes, we can’t mutually characterize their relationship with humor outcomes:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Trevor can <humor-outcome><sem>easily</sem> build rapport (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome>, but Sebastian <humor-outcome><sem>struggles</sem> to build rapport (with Trevor)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>Trevor can <humor-outcome><sem>easily</sem> open new topics of conversation (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome>, but Sebastian <humor-outcome><sem>struggles</sem> to open new topics of conversation (with Trevor)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>Trevor <humor-outcome><sem>easily</sem> avoids conflict (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome>, but Sebastian <humor-outcome><sem>struggles</sem> to avoid conflict (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>By contrast, a <em>mutual</em> humor bush is when people make each other feel humor equally:</p>

 <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-07-each-person-has-humor-bush/19-07-1-two-humor-bushes-trevor-yasmin.png
    

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>
    Trevor and Yasmin make each other feel similar amounts of humor. This means we can characterize their overall relationship as <humor-outcome>having strong rapport (with each other)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>able to open almost any topic of conversation (with each other)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>able to avoid conflict most of the time (with each other)</humor-outcome>, and so on. Unlike in an asymmetric humor bush, these characterizations go both ways.
    </p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="consider">We said that Sebastian <humor-outcome><term>struggles</term> to avoid conflict (with Trevor)</humor-outcome>, while <humor-outcome>Trevor <em>easily</em> avoids conflict (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome>. This means that if <term>Sebastian</term> is escalating conflict, it’s easy for Trevor to avoid it—but if <em>Trevor</em> is escalating conflict, it’s hard for his nephew to avoid it. By contrast, Trevor and Yasmin are about equally capable of avoiding conflict with each other.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Sizes.</headline> Mutual humor bushes can be both large or both small, depending on how frequently and intensely both people feel humor around each other:</p>

    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

    
    <p>For instance, Yasmin has a large mutual humor bush with Trevor, but a small mutual humor bush with her coworker Frank. They’re both mutual humor bushes—to characterize them accurately, we specify whether mutual humor bushes are large or small.</p>
