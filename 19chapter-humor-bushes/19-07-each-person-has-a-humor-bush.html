<p>While we’ve been thinking about a relationship between people as having one humor bush, there’s really two humor bushes involved—a humor bush for each person in the relationship. That’s because not everyone feels humor equally.</p>

<p>For instance, Trevor makes his twelve-year-old nephew <term>Sebastian</term> feel a lot of humor, but Sebastian rarely makes <em>Trevor</em> feel humor.</p>

 

<p><speech>Trevor:</speech> “Hey, do you want to watch me play StormConQuest?”</p>

<p><speech>Sebastian:</speech> <action>*tries to hide delight and wonder*</action> “Yes!” <action>*runs to den*</action> (&larr;Trevor often makes Sebastian feel humor)</p>

<p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
<p><speech>Sebastian:</speech> (Nervous) “Um, do you want to watch me play StormConQuest?</p>

<p><speech>Trevor:</speech> *checks phone* “Not right now. Maybe later, okay?” (&larr;Sebastian rarely makes Trevor feel humor)</p> 

<p>Over time, this leads to asymmetric humor bushes:</p>



<p>When there are asymmetric humor bushes, we can’t mutually characterize their relationship with humor outcomes:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Trevor can easily build rapport (with Sebastian), but Sebastian struggles to build rapport (with Trevor)</li>
    <li>Trevor can easily open new topics of conversation (with Sebastian), but Sebastian struggles to open new topics of conversation (with Trevor)</li>
    <li>Trevor easily avoid conflict (with Sebastian), but Sebastian struggles to avoid conflict (with Sebastian)</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>By contrast, a mutual humor bush is when people make each other feel humor equally:</p>


<p>
    Trevor and Yasmin make each other feel similar amounts of humor. This means we can characterize their overall relationship as having strong rapport (with each other), able to open almost any topic of conversation (with each other), able to avoid conflict most of the time (with each other) and so on. Unlike in an asymmetric humor bush, these characterizations go both ways.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="consider">We said that Sebastian struggles to avoid conflict (with Trevor), while Trevor easily avoids conflict (with Sebastian). This means that if Sebastian is escalating conflict, it’s easy for Trevor to avoid it—but if Trevor is escalating conflict, it’s hard for his nephew to avoid it. By contrast, Trevor and Yasmin are about equally capable of avoiding conflict with each other.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Sizes.</headline> Mutual humor bushes can be both large or both small, depending on how frequently and intensely both people feel humor around each other:</p>
    
    
    <p>For instance, Yasmin has a large mutual humor bush with Trevor, but a small mutual humor bush with her coworker Frank. They’re both mutual humor bushes—to characterize them accurately, we specify whether mutual humor bushes are large or small.</p>
