    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Each person has a humor bush</h1>


<p>While we’ve been thinking about a relationship between people as having <term>one</term> humor bush, there’s really <em>two</em> humor bushes involved—a humor bush for <sem>each person</sem> in the relationship. That’s because not everyone feels humor equally.</p>

<p>For instance, <term>Trevor</term> makes his twelve-year-old nephew <term>Sebastian</term> feel a lot of humor, but <em>Sebastian</em> rarely makes <em>Trevor</em> feel humor.</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“Hey, do you want to watch me play <book-title>StormConQuest</book-title>?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sebastian:</speaker> <action>*tries to hide delight and wonder*</action> <speech>“Yes!”</speech> <action>*runs to den*</action> <notes>(&larr;Trevor often makes Sebastian feel humor)</notes></p>

    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    <p><speaker>Sebastian:</speaker> <internalaction>(nervous)</internalaction> <speech>“Um, do you want to watch me play <book-title>StormConQuest</book-title>?"</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*checks phone*</action> <speech>“Not right now. Maybe later, okay?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sebastian rarely makes Trevor feel humor)</notes></p>
</div> 


<p>Over time, this leads to <vocab>asymmetric</vocab> humor bushes:</p>

<p>When there are asymmetric humor bushes, we can’t mutually characterize their relationship with humor outcomes:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Trevor can <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> build rapport (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome>, but Sebastian <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>struggles</outcome-contrast> to build rapport (with Trevor)</humor-outcome></li>
   
    <li>Trevor can <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> open new topics of conversation (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome>, but Sebastian <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>struggles</outcome-contrast> to open new topics of conversation (with Trevor)</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li>Trevor <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> avoids conflict (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome>, but Sebastian <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>struggles</outcome-contrast> to avoid conflict (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>By contrast, a <vocab>mutual</vocab> humor bush is when people make each other feel humor equally:</p>

    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>
    Trevor and Yasmin make each other feel similar amounts of humor. This means we can characterize their overall relationship as <humor-outcome>having strong <outcome-contrast>mutual</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>mutually</outcome-contrast> able to open almost any topic of conversation (with each other)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>able to avoid conflict <outcome-contrast>most of the time</outcome-contrast> (with each other)</humor-outcome>, and so on. Unlike in an asymmetric humor bush, these characterizations go both ways.
    </p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We said that Sebastian <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>struggles</outcome-contrast> to avoid conflict (with Trevor)</humor-outcome>, while <humor-outcome>Trevor <outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> avoids conflict (with Sebastian)</humor-outcome>. This asymmetric humor bush means that if <term>Sebastian</term> is escalating conflict, it’s easy for <term>Trevor</term> to avoid it—but if <em>Trevor</em> is escalating conflict, it’s hard for his <em>nephew</em> to avoid it.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">By contrast, the mutual humor bush means that Trevor and Yasmin are about <sem>equally</sem> capable of avoiding conflict with each other.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Sizes.</headline> Mutual humor bushes can be both large or both small, depending on how frequently and intensely both people feel humor around each other:</p>

    style="max-width: 17rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem;" 
     >

    
    <p>For instance, Yasmin has a <term>large</term> mutual humor bush with <term>Trevor</term>, but a <em>small</em> mutual humor bush with her coworker <em>Frank</em>. They’re both mutual humor bushes—and so to characterize them accurately, we specify whether a mutual humor bushes is large or small.</p>
