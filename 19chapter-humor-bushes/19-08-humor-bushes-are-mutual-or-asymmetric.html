    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor bushes are mutual or asymmetric</h1>



<p>Emma and Zoe feel equally frequent and intense humor around each other, so their humor bushes aren’t asymmetric, but mutual:</p>

<p>By contrast, the humor bushes are asymmetric when people <sem>don't</sem> equally feel humor around each other:</p>

<p>Sam and Jasper have asymmetric humor bushes. Since Jasper is a stand-up comic, Sam lights up every time he thinks about Jasper. But since Jasper has never formally met Sam, Jasper never thinks about Sam—let alone feels humor from him.</p>  

<p>Humor bushes can be mutual or asymmetric, but whether this is good or bad depends on the situation.</p>

<p>Sometimes an asymmetric humor bush is part of how we do our job. For instance, a Heather wants her students to feel more humor than she makes them feel in return:</p>

  <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric/19-08-2-teacher-student-asymmetric.png

    style="max-width: 26rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: .5rem;" 
     >


 

<p>Heather wants to be able to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (students)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support their arguments (to the students)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>(have more) control of a situation, deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, and so on—but she doesn’t want to let the students do the same to her in the same proportion.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Just because two sides laugh a lot doesn’t mean there are mutual humor bushes. Heather might make herself laugh, along with her students—but this is Heather growing a humor bush with <term>herself</term>, and not the <em>students</em> growing a humor bush with her.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>Other times, asymmetric humor bushes aren’t as positive—like how Elias often helps Jessica feel humor, but less often lets Jessica help him feel humor:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*to Emma*</action> <internalaction>(happily)</internalaction> <speech>“Elias is so funny.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Always cracks himself up, does he?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma notices Elias laughs because of himself more than he laughs because of Jessica)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>When someone isn’t aware of the asymmetry, it can be a sign of manipulation—or a source of inaccurate observations:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
       <p>Barista flashes Owen a grin.</p> 
        
        <p><speaker>Barista:</speaker> <speech>“The usual for our best customer?”</speech></p>
        
        <p>Owen: <internalaction>(delighted)</internalaction> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“You know me too well!”</speech> 
        
         <p><narration>She goes to make the maple cappuccino.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(thinking)</internalaction> <speech>“That barista and I have chemistry! Wonder if she’s single?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen mistakes an asymmetric humor bush for a mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
        
        </div>

  <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric/19-08-4-owen-barista.png
    

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 26rem; margin-left: 1rem" 
     >



<p>Owen’s error is in thinking that <term>his</term> humor bush is the same size as the <em>barista’s</em> humor bush—but since Owen feels much higher intensity and longer duration humor then the barista does, they actually have asymmetric humor bushes.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Owen and the barista do feel mutual humor together—but their mutual <sem>humor bush</sem> is capped at the smallest bush of the two.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">We can use a quantification metaphor to think about this. If Owen has a “7” humor bush with the barista, and the barista has a “3” humor bush with Owen, the mutual humor bush is capped at the lowest (3) and not the highest (7).
        </p>

    <p class="considertext">If Owen thinks they mutually share 7, not 3, he can lose track of their actual social relationship.</p>
