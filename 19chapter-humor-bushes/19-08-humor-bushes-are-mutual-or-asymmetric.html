<p>Emma and Zoe feel equally frequent and intense humor around each other, so their humor bushes aren’t asymmetric, but mutual:</p>

 

<p>By contrast, the humor bushes are asymmetric when people don't equally feel humor around each other:</p>



<p>Sam and Jasper have asymmetric humor bushes. Since Jasper is a stand-up comic, Sam lights up every time he thinks about Jasper. But since Jasper has never formally met Sam, Jasper never thinks about Sam—let alone feels humor from him.</p>  

<p>Humor bushes can be mutual or asymmetric, but whether this is good or bad depends on the situation.</p>

<p>Sometimes an asymmetric humor bush is part of how we do our job. For instance, a Heather wants her students to feel more humor than she make them feel in return:</p>

 

<p>Heather wants to be able to acceptably criticize (students), support their arguments (to the students), (have more) control of a situation, deal with taboo topics, and so on—but she doesn’t want to let the students do the same to her in the same proportion.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Just because two sides laugh a lot doesn’t mean there are mutual humor bushes. Heather might make herself laugh, along with her students—but this is Heather growing a humor bush with herself, and not the students growing a humor bush with her.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>Other times, asymmetric humor bushes aren’t as positive—like how Elias often helps Jessica feel humor, but less often lets Jessica help him feel humor:</p>

 

<p>Jessica: *to Emma* (happily) “Elias is so funny.”</p>

<p>Emma: (annoyed) “Always cracks himself up, does he?” (&larr;Emma notices Elias laughs because of himself more than he laughs because of Jessica)</p>



<p>When someone isn’t aware of the asymmetry, it can be a sign of manipulation—or a source of inaccurate observations:</p>

 

<p>Barista flashes Owen a grin. “The usual for our best customer?”</p>

<p>“You know me too well!” Owen says delighted, smiling stupidly. She goes to make the double-shot cappuccino.</p>

<p>Owen: (thinking) “That barista and I have chemistry! Wonder if she’s single?” (&larr;Owen mistakes an asymmetric humor bush for a mutual humor bush)</p>



<p>Owen’s error is in thinking that his humor bush is the same size as the barista’s humor bush—but since Owen feels much higher intensity and longer duration humor then the barista does, they actually have asymmetric humor bushes.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">Owen and the barista do feel mutual humor together—but their mutual humor bush is capped at the smallest bush of the two.</p>

 

<p class="considertext">We can use a quantification metaphor to think about this. If Owen has a “7” humor bush with the barista, and the barista has a “3” humor bush with Owen, the mutual humor bush is capped at the lowest (3) and not the highest (7).
    </p>




 

<p class="considertext">If Owen thinks they mutually share 7, not 3, he can lose track of their actual social relationship.</p>

 

 

<p><headline>Webs of humor bushes.</headline> We could set people into a web of relations, with one of the general attributes of each connection being a humor bush.</p>


<p>Humor is an important quality in the relations between people—something we’ll notice in our thinking all the time.</p>
