    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">Humor bushes are mutual or asymmetric</h2>



<p>Emma and Zoe feel equally frequent and intense humor around each other, so their humor bushes aren’t asymmetric, but mutual:</p>

     >

 

<p>By contrast, the humor bushes are asymmetric when people <em>don't</em> equally feel humor around each other:</p>

  <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric/19-08-1-jasper-sam-asymmetric.png

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: ;margin-top: .5rem;" 
     >




<p>Sam and Jasper have asymmetric humor bushes. Since Jasper is a stand-up comic, Sam lights up every time he thinks about Jasper. But since Jasper has never formally met Sam, Jasper never thinks about Sam&mdash;let alone feels humor from him.</p>  

<p>Humor bushes can be mutual or asymmetric, but whether this is fitted or unfitted depends on the situation.</p>

<p>Sometimes an asymmetric humor bush is part of how we do our job. For instance, a Heather wants her students to feel more humor than they make her feel in return:</p>

  <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric/19-08-2-teacher-student-asymmetric.png
    

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 26rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: .5rem;" 
     >


 

<p>Heather wants to be able to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (students)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support her arguments (to the students)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>(have more) control of a situation, deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, and so on&mdash;but she doesn’t want to let the students do the same to her in the same proportion.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>Just because two sides laugh doesn’t mean there are mutual humor bushes. Heather might make <sem-weak>herself</sem-weak> laugh, along with her students&mdash;but this is <term>Heather</term> growing a humor bush with <term>herself</term>, and not the <term2>students</term2> growing a humor bush with <term2>Heather</term2>.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>Other times, asymmetric humor bushes aren’t as positive&mdash;like how Elias often helps Jessica feel humor, but less often lets Jessica help him feel humor:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*to Emma*</action> <internalaction>(happily)</internalaction> <speech>“Elias is so funny.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Always cracks himself up, does he?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma notices Elias laughs because of himself more than he laughs because of Jessica)</notes></p>

<p>When someone isn’t aware of the asymmetry, it can be a sign of manipulation&mdash;or a source of inaccurate observations:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
       <p><narration>The barista flashes Owen a grin.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><speaker>Barista:</speaker> <speech>“The usual for our best customer?”</speech></p>
        
        <p>Owen: <internalaction>(delighted)</internalaction> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“You know me too well!”</speech> 
        
         <p><narration>She goes to make the maple cappuccino.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(thinking)</internalaction> <speech>“That barista and I have <sem-weak>chemistry</sem-weak>! Wonder if she’s single?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen mistakes an asymmetric humor bush for a mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
        
        </div>

  <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric/19-08-4-owen-barista.png
    

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 26rem; margin-left: 1rem" 
     >



<p>Owen’s error is in thinking that <term>his</term> humor bush is the same size as the <term2>barista’s</term2> humor bush&mdash;but since Owen feels much higher intensity and longer duration humor then the barista does, they actually have asymmetric humor bushes.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>Owen and the barista do feel <em>mutual</em> humor together&mdash;but their mutual humor bush is capped at the smallest bush of the two.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>To use a quantification metaphor, if Owen has a “7” humor bush with the barista, and the barista has a “3” humor bush with Owen, the mutual humor bush is capped at the lowest (3) and isn't the highest (7).
        </p>

    <p>If Owen thinks they mutually share 7, not 3, he can lose track of their actual social relationship.</p>

<p>Moments of humor have both intensity and fittedness. Sometimes we prioritize <term>fittedness</term> <callback>("charm")</callback> and sometimes we prioritize <term2>intensity</term2> <callback>("comedy")</callback>&mdash;and these priorities shape how we judge humor.</p>

<p>But sometimes we prioritize another measure: <vocab>status</vocab>. When we prioritize status <callback>("promotion")</callback>, we start judging humor as good or bad in sometimes strange ways:</p>

<p>Above, Owen felt humor himself, and he saw Zoe feel humor&mdash;which means the novel had decent intensity, fittedness, or both. It’s not until Owen gives priority to his own ideas about <sem-weak>status</sem-weak> that he decides that it’s “bad” humor.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with prioritizing status. One is that status is often tangential to the experience&mdash;a bit like judging someone’s cooking by how much we like their kitchen decor.</p>

<p>Another problem is that status is often entirely in our own heads&mdash;Owen is probably the only one of his social circle who worries that tolerating or briefly enjoying a romance novel is status-decreasing.</p> 

<p>This means Owen is prioritizing his status for an audience of one. He’s essentially trying to impress himself!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>If we get into a habit of prioritizing personal ideas about status, even when no one cares, we can develop a strange relation to humor.</p> 
    
     
    
    <p>We tend to see people who prioritize status over fittedness or intensity to be dull, excruciating, narrow, self-serving, socially insecure, uncurious, uninteresting, and so on.</p> 

<p>In the same way we feel this about <term>others</term>, others feel this about <term2>us</term2>!</p>
</div>


<p>The point isn’t that Owen should read books he doesn’t want to&mdash;the point is that he doesn’t need to have a backlash against himself for simply enjoying paging through a book. And he doesn’t need to look down on Zoe for enjoying what she enjoys.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    <p>If Owen looked down on Zoe, he would be judging <term>her</term> based on <term2>his own</term2> ideas of status&mdash;which doesn’t really accomplish anything.</p>
</div>

<p>Owen doesn’t gain anything by prioritizing status when around Zoe&mdash;but he and Zoe <em>do</em> gain something when he <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> prioritize status. If Owen feels humor when Zoe feels humor, they can grow a mutual humor bush:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(sincerely)</internalaction> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Looks like a fun book!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“It is fun.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Good book?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Shameless.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“The dialogue in this book is outrageous!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Isn’t it?!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
</div>


<p>When Owen and Zoe grow a mutual humor bush through mutual humor, they grow their ability to mutually characterize their relationship with mutual humor family words&mdash;like <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>This mutual humor allows Owen to accrue greater respect from the people around him. By not prioritizing status, he opens the possibility of this mutual humor.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>Owen gains respect by treating Zoe the way he would want to be treated himself.</p>
    
     <p>Owen wouldn’t want Zoe to feel shame for briefly enjoying something he enjoyed, or for her to feel condescension toward <sem-weak>him</sem-weak> for enjoying what he enjoyed<p>
    
    <p>This equal-ranking is a foundational condition for mutual humor bushes.</p>
</div>


<p>If Owen doesn’t treat others as equals, and prioritizes his personal ideas of status over everything else, he’ll have to live with an internal censor in his head&mdash;one that’s constantly screening his humor for status, fighting against moments of humor, prompting feelings of anger or guilt, and so on.</p> 

<p>This can pointlessly curtail the range and vividness of his experiences and relationships&mdash;without any benefit.</p>
