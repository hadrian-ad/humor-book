    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor bushes are mutual or asymmetric</h1>



<p>Emma and Zoe feel equally frequent and intense humor around each other, so their humor bushes aren’t asymmetric, but mutual:</p>

     >

 

<p>By contrast, the humor bushes are asymmetric when people <sem>don't</sem> equally feel humor around each other:</p>

    style="max-width: ; margin-left: ;margin-top: .5rem;" 
     >




<p>Sam and Jasper have asymmetric humor bushes. Since Jasper is a stand-up comic, Sam lights up every time he thinks about Jasper. But since Jasper has never formally met Sam, Jasper never thinks about Sam—let alone feels humor from him.</p>  

<p>Humor bushes can be mutual or asymmetric, but whether this is fitted or unfitted depends on the situation.</p>

<p>Sometimes an asymmetric humor bush is part of how we do our job. For instance, a Heather wants her students to feel more humor than they make her feel in return:</p>

  <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric/19-08-2-teacher-student-asymmetric.png
    

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 26rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: .5rem;" 
     >


 

<p>Heather wants to be able to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (students)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support her arguments (to the students)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>(have more) control of a situation, deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, and so on—but she doesn’t want to let the students do the same to her in the same proportion.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Just because two sides laugh doesn’t mean there are mutual humor bushes. Heather might make <sem-weak>herself</sem-weak> laugh, along with her students—but this is <term>Heather</term> growing a humor bush with <term>herself</term>, and not the <em>students</em> growing a humor bush with <em>Heather</em>.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>Other times, asymmetric humor bushes aren’t as positive—like how Elias often helps Jessica feel humor, but less often lets Jessica help him feel humor:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*to Emma*</action> <internalaction>(happily)</internalaction> <speech>“Elias is so funny.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Always cracks himself up, does he?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma notices Elias laughs because of himself more than he laughs because of Jessica)</notes></p>

<p>When someone isn’t aware of the asymmetry, it can be a sign of manipulation—or a source of inaccurate observations:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
       <p><narration>The barista flashes Owen a grin.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><speaker>Barista:</speaker> <speech>“The usual for our best customer?”</speech></p>
        
        <p>Owen: <internalaction>(delighted)</internalaction> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“You know me too well!”</speech> 
        
         <p><narration>She goes to make the maple cappuccino.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(thinking)</internalaction> <speech>“That barista and I have <sem-weak>chemistry</sem-weak>! Wonder if she’s single?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen mistakes an asymmetric humor bush for a mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
        
        </div>

  <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric/19-08-4-owen-barista.png
    

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 26rem; margin-left: 1rem" 
     >



<p>Owen’s error is in thinking that <term>his</term> humor bush is the same size as the <em>barista’s</em> humor bush—but since Owen feels much higher intensity and longer duration humor then the barista does, they actually have asymmetric humor bushes.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Owen and the barista do feel <sem>mutual</sem> humor together—but their mutual humor bush is capped at the smallest bush of the two.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">To use a quantification metaphor, if Owen has a “7” humor bush with the barista, and the barista has a “3” humor bush with Owen, the mutual humor bush is capped at the lowest (3) and not the highest (7).
        </p>

<p>But sometimes we prioritize another measure: <vocab>status</vocab>. When we prioritize status <callback>(promotion)</callback>, we start judging humor as good or bad in sometimes strange ways:</p>

<p>Above, Owen felt humor himself, and he saw Zoe feel humor—which means the novel had decent intensity, fittedness, or both. It’s not until Owen gives priority to his own ideas about status that he decides that it’s “bad” humor.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with prioritizing status. One is that status is somewhat tangential to the experience—a bit like judging someone’s cooking by how much we like their kitchen decor.</p>

<p>Another problem is that status is often entirely in our own heads—Owen is probably the only one of his social circle who worries that tolerating or briefly enjoying a romance novel is status-decreasing.</p> 

<p>This means Owen is prioritizing his status for an audience of one. He’s essentially trying to impress himself!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If we get into a habit of prioritizing personal ideas about status, even when no one cares, we can develop a strange relation to humor.</p> 
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">We find <term>other</term> people who prioritize status over fittedness or intensity to be dull, excruciating, narrow, self-serving, socially insecure, uncurious, uninteresting, and so on. It's the same way people feel about <em>us</em>, when we prioritize status!</p>
</div>


<p>The point isn’t that Owen should read books he doesn’t want to. Instead, the point is that he doesn’t need to have a backlash against himself for simply enjoying paging through a book—and he doesn’t need to look down on Zoe for enjoying what she enjoys.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Owen would be judging <term>her</term> based on <em>his own</em> ideas of status—which doesn’t really accomplish anything.</p>
</div>

<p>Owen doesn’t gain anything by prioritizing status when around Zoe—but he and Zoe <term>do</term> gain something when he <em>doesn’t</em> prioritize status. If Owen feels humor when Zoe feels humor, they can grow a mutual humor bush:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(sincerely)</internalaction> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Looks like a fun book!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“It is fun.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Good book?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Shameless.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“The dialogue in this book is outrageous!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Isn’t it?!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
</div>


<p>When Owen and Zoe grow a mutual humor bush through mutula humor, they grow their ability to mutually characterize their relationship with mutual humor family words&mdash;since Zoe and Owen often feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. It's mutual humor that allows Owen to accrue greater respect from the people around him.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Owen gains respect by treating Zoe the way he would want to be treated himself.  Owen wouldn’t want her to feel condescension toward him for enjoying what he enjoyed, or for her to feel shame herself for briefly enjoying something he enjoyed.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This equal-ranking is a foundational condition for mutual humor bushes.</p>
</div>


<p>If Owen doesn’t equal-rank others, and prioritizes his personal ideas of status over everything else, he’ll have to live with an internal censor in his head—one that’s constantly screening his humor for status; fighting against moments of humor; and prompting feelings of anger or guilt. This can pointlessly curtail the range and vividness of his experiences and relationships—without any benefit.</p>
