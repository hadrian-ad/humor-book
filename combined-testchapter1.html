<p>Humor happens in a <vocab>universal pattern</vocab>. We can put this pattern most simply as:</p> 


<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
</p>

<p>
    We'll explain this in detail soon. But first we'll get a general sense of how this pattern works:

  </p>
</div>



<p>
    In each example, someone found something humorous or not based on their evaluation of a mistake as OK or not OK.
    </p>
    
<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as OK.

    We're using words like "mistake" and "OK" in new ways. We'll be looking more precisely at what these words mean over the next few sections.

   In this book, mistakes aren't something “bad”—they're just mistakes in our expectations:

    The examples above aren’t <term>examples</term> of <term>humor</term>—we're just looking at <em>examples</em> of what we're calling <em>mistakes</em>. Mistakes are just <sem-weak>one part</sem-weak> of our pattern of humor. 
    </p>

    <p class="consider">
        Consider:
        </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        We labeled mistakes above based on the perspective of the people <sem>in</sem> the examples. The <term>characters</term> thought they were mistakes&mdash;which may or may not overlap with what we, as <em>readers</em>, feel are mistakes. We’ll do this throughout this book.
        </p>
</div>


<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Expectations.</headline> 
            A more formal term for a mistake would be a <vocab>deviation from our expectations</vocab>. We have <term>expectations</term> for how things should be, and sometimes things <em>deviate</em> from those expectations.
            </p>
            
                <p>
        This isn't about whether something is good or bad—instead, it's about whether something conforms to our expectations.
        </p>
    
    <div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">
        For instance:
        </p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">
        Since we expect an egg to have <term>one</term> yolk, it’s a deviation from our expectations to find an egg with <em>two</em> yolks—or an egg with <em>no</em> yolk.</p> 
        
        <p class="for-instance-text">Similarly, if we thought we knew the <term>billing</term>, it’s a deviation from our expectations to get an unexpected <em>fee</em>—or get an unexpected <em>discount</em>.
        </p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">
        It doesn’t matter whether we feel these deviations from our expectations are good or bad. A mistake is when our expectations don't match what we actually encounter.

        </div>
    <p>
        For now, we’ll be using these terms interchangeably <callback>(mistake = deviation from our expectations)</callback>. We’ll mostly use “mistake,” since it’s shorter and less cumbersome.

<p>
	In this chapter, we’ll look at <vocab>humor family words</vocab>. These are contextual variations of the word  humor: 
</p>
<h2>Humor family words</h2>
<ul class="close-list">
<li>acceptance</li>
<li>accomplishment</li>
<li>achievement</li>
<li>appreciation</li>
<li>belonging</li>
<li>comfort</li>

<li>release</li>
<li>revelation</li>
<li>relief</li>
<li>safety</li>
<li>success</li>
<li>welcome</li>
    </ul>
<p>
	Humor family words are moments where we feel humor:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Justin and Heather are mountain biking when Justin flips on a root and tumbles down a small hill.</narration> <speech>“Oh my god! Justin! Are you okay?”</speech> <narration>Heather calls, jumping off her bike and scrambling down to the body and bike below.</narration>
</p>
<p>
	<narration>Justin stirs and sits up.</narration> <speech>“Oof,”</speech> <narration>he says, adjusting his helmet shakily.</narration> <speech>“I’m fine!”</speech>
</p>
<p>
	<narration>They look at each other and start giggling with relief.</narration>
	<notes>(&larr;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;realization, relief, release, safety&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
</p>
    </div>
<p>
	We can describe Heather and Justin’s humor as <emotions>humor</emotions>—but also as humor family words, like <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.  
</p>
<p>	
	The generic word "humor" by itself doesn't imply any context:

<p>
   When we want to give more situational context, we replace humor with a humor family words—like <emotions>relief</emotions>:

      <p class=listbox-headline>Humor family words</p>
      
  	<p>
    <i>acceptance, accomplishment, achievement, appreciation, belonging, comfort, connection, delight, forgiveness, generosity, insight, joy,

	Since at first it can seem odd to think of humor family words <sem>as</sem> humor, we'll go through some of our humor family words one-by-one.</p> 
	
	<p>We'll see that these words are all humor—all moments where we evaluate mistakes as OK:
</p>
	
<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title. <i>“Wherever You Go, There You Are.”</i> She thinks about that for a second, puzzled.</narration></p> 
	
	<p><narration>Then something clicks. She laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;realization&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> 
</p>
</div>
<p>
	Zoe laughs after reading a book title: her mistakes and OKs shift in a way that generates humor. In context, we can describe this specific instance of humor as
	<emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on. These are all different words that describe the same thing: humor.

<p>
	When mistakes are balanced with an OK, we often describe this humor in context as <emotions>realization</emotions>:
