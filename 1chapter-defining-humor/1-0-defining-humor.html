  Defining humor as a pattern
<!--    01.00 -->
</h1>

<p>There's a <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> to when there's humor. Put most simply, it's:</p> 


<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
</p>

<p>
    We'll explain this all in detail soon. But first, we'll get a general sense of this pattern through some examples:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Minh is playing with his baby nephew. Minh covers his face with his hands, and the baby’s mouth drops, confused.</narration></p>
        
        <p><narration>Minh pulls his hand aside.</narration> <speech>“Peek-a-boo!”</speech> <narration>he cries.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>The baby laughs with delight.</narration> <notes>(&larr;baby evaluates the mistake of disappearing and reappearing as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin evaluates the mistake of clarity as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
	       <p><narration>Owen gets Emma and Zoe the same gift. They each open it at the same time.</narration></p> 	   
	       
	       <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*holds up figurine*</action> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma evaluates the mistake of not knowing as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <speech>"What is it?"</speech></p>
	       <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*turns her figurine over*</action> <action>*frowns*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe evaluates the mistake of not knowing as <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> OK&harr;&#xFE0E;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes> <speech>"Yeah... what is it?"</speech></p>
	   </div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor walks into class and trips, and the cereal he’s carrying falls down his shirt. At first his classmates are shocked. But when they see that he’s not hurt, they smile and laugh with relief.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor’s classmates evaluate the mistake of falling as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
    </p>   
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor, on the other hand, is embarrassed. His shirt is dirty, and he stalks to the bathroom, decidedly unamused.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor evaluates the mistake of falling as not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Riley sees a squirrel on a pumpkin and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Riley evaluates the mistake of a squirrel on a pumpkin as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Sam:</speaker> <narration><internalaction>(baffled)</internalaction></narration> <speech>“What’s so funny?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam evaluates his confusion as mistake that’s not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Jennifer sees the squirrel and laughs too.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer evaluates the mistake of a squirrel on a pumpkin as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    In each example, someone found something humorous or not based on their evaluation of a mistake as OK or not OK.
    </p>
    
<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We're using words like "mistake" and "OK" in new ways. We'll be looking more precisely at what these words mean here over the next few sections.
