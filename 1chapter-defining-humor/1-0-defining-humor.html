  A pattern to humor
<!--    01.00 -->
</h1>

<p>Sometimes we think humor happens at random&mdash;but it doesn't. There's a <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> to humor.</p> 


<p>
    The shortest way of describing the pattern to humor is like this:
</p>

<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
</p>

<p>
    We'll explain this all in detail soon. But first, we'll get a general sense of this pattern through some examples:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Minh is playing with his baby nephew. Minh covers his face with his hands, and the baby’s mouth drops, confused.</narration></p>
        
        <p><narration>Minh pulls his hand aside.</narration> <speech>“Peek-a-boo!”</speech> <narration>he cries.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>The baby laughs with delight.</narration> <notes>(&larr;baby evaluates the mistake of disappearing and reappearing as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor walks into class and trips, and the cereal he’s carrying falls down his shirt. At first his classmates are shocked. But when they see that he’s not hurt, they smile and laugh with relief.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor’s classmates evaluate the mistake of falling as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
    </p>   
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor, on the other hand, is embarrassed. His shirt is dirty, and he stalks to the bathroom, decidedly unamused.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor evaluates the mistake of falling as not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes>
  </p>
</div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin evaluates the mistake of clarity as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Riley sees a squirrel on a pumpkin and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Riley evaluates the mistake of a squirrel on a pumpkin as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Sam:</speaker> <narration><internalaction>(baffled)</internalaction></narration> <speech>“What’s so funny?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam evaluates his confusion as mistake that’s not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Jennifer sees the squirrel and laughs too.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer evaluates the mistake of a squirrel on a pumpkin as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
    </p>
</div>

<p>
    In each example, someone found something humorous or not based on their evaluation of a mistake as OK or not OK.
    </p>
    
<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    In the next few sections, we'll be looking at words like "mistake" and "OK" more closely.
