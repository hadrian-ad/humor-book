     <p>In this chapter, we'll be looking at the <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we feel humor. We can put this pattern most simply as:</p> 


<p class="lesson">
    Humor is mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
</p>

<p>
    We'll explain this in detail soon. But first we'll get a general sense of how this pattern works:

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor walks into class and trips, and the cereal he’s carrying falls down his shirt.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>At first his classmates are shocked. But when they see that he’s not hurt, they smile and laugh with relief.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor’s classmates evaluate a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
    </p>   
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor, on the other hand, is embarrassed. His shirt is dirty, and he stalks to the bathroom, decidedly unamused.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor evaluates a mistake as not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes>
  </p>

<p>
    In each example, someone felt humor or not based on their evaluation of a mistake as OK or not OK.
    </p>
    
    <p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion that someone feels whey they evaluate a mistake as OK.</p>
    
<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We're using words like "mistake" and "OK" in new ways. We'll be looking more precisely at what these words mean over the next few sections.
