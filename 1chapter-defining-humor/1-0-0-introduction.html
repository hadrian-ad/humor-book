<h1>1. Patterns</h1>

<p>In this chapter, we'll begin looking at <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> there's humor. </p>
   
<p>For instance, we may see the signs below and laugh at them&mdash;but we also may <sem-weak>not</sem-weak> laugh at them:</p>
             <img src="../images/0c-images-welcome/0-0-welcome/0-funny-signs.png" 
	        
	        style="max-width: 33rem; margin-left: 1rem;"
	        
	        alt="This image is a composite of three different photos. Each photo shows atypical signage.
	        
	        Photo 1 has chalk writing above a hard-to-read danger sign, so it now reads 'unreadable signs cause ... danger.'
	        
	        Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
	        
	        Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
	        
	        At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"
	        
	        title="why are things funny?">

	   <p>Similarly, we may recieve the same gift, but there won't be humor equally:</p>
	   
	   <div class="vignette">
	       <p><narration>Owen gets Emma and Zoe the same gift. They each open it at the same time.</narration></p> 	   
	       
	       <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*holds up figurine*</action> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>"What is it?"</speech></p>
	       <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*turns her figurine over*</action> <action>*frowns*</action> <notes>(&larr;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes> <speech>"Yeah... what is it?"</speech></p>
	   </div>

	   
    <p>There's a shared pattern to when there's humor. We'll be looking at this pattern the rest of this chapter.</p>
    
    <!--
    <p>we'll always involve people&mdash;so not just <term>signs</term> themselves, but <em>people</em> looking at the signs.</p>
 
    
    <p>We'll be going over humor dynamics from beginning to end, so that you'll finish substantially better at observing, describing understanding, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

<p>It'll be at least somewhat fun and very interesting&mdash;you'll see!</p>


       
       <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Jennifer and Sam take their daughter Riley to a zoo. They see a sign that says GOATS HAVE NO MANNERS.</narration></p>
           
           <p><speaker>Jennifer &amp; Sam:</speaker> <action>*laugh*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
           
             <p><speaker>Riley:</speaker> <speech>"What? What?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;no humor)</notes></p>   </div> 
          
<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Dave taxis through another country and laughs at a stop sign that's not in English.</narration> <notes>(&larr; humor)</notes></p>
        
        <p><narration>The taxi driver doesn't laugh and bites back annoyance.</narration> <notes>(&larr;no humor)</notes></p>
           </div> 
	        
<p>Sometimes we think humor happens at random&mdash;but it doesn't. There's a <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> to humor. We'll be talking about this pattern throughout this chapter.</p>
