<h1>Defining humor</h1>



<!--       
    <p>In this book, we'll be learning <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> humor happens, <term>what</term> this means, and <em>how</em> it all fits together with everything.</p>
     -->
      
<p>In this chapter, we'll begin defining humor:</p>  
       
       <div class="vignette">
          <p>
              <narration>Zoe, Emma, and Owen are walking through campus when they see a sign that says DANGER, with the warning whited out.</narration>
          </p> 
           
<p>
    <speaker>Chalk:</speaker> <speech>"Unreadable signs cause..."</speech>

       <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Jennifer and Sam take their daughter Riley to a zoo. They see a sign that says GOATS HAVE NO MANNERS.</narration></p>
           
           <p><speaker>Jennifer &amp; Sam:</speaker> <action>*laugh*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>

<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Dave taxis through another country and laughs at the stop sign.</narration> <notes>(&larr; humor)</notes></p>
        
        <p><narration>The taxi driver doesn't laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;no humor)</notes></p>
           </div> 
         
          
          
    <p>Some people might smile and laugh at the signs below. But why only <sem-weak>some</sem-weak> people, <sem-weak>some</sem-weak> of the time?</p>
        

	    <img src="../images/0c-images-welcome/0-0-welcome/0-funny-signs.png" 
	        
	        style="max-width: 33rem; margin-left: 1rem;"
	        
	        alt="This image is a composite of three different photos. Each photo shows atypical signage.
	        
	        Photo 1 has chalk writing above a hard-to-read danger sign, so it now reads 'unreadable signs cause ... danger.'
	        
	        Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
	        
	        Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
	        
	        At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"
	        
	        title="why are things funny?">
	        
<p>Sometimes we think there's no rhyme or reason to laughter. But there's a <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> to when we smile and laugh.</p> 
                       
<p>In this chapter, we'll introduce this pattern at its simplest, and we'll increasingly layer in more complexity to this pattern throughout this book.</p>

   <p><headline>Sequence.</headline> This book is designed to be read in order, so that we can layer in understanding based on what's come before. It's likely that at some point we'll read something and think <callback>"well, what about...?"</callback> </p>
   
   <p>We'll probably get to it soon! Just keep reading, and we'll get to implied considerations. </p>
