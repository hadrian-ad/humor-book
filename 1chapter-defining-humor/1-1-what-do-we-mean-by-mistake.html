    What do we mean by "mistake"?
</h1>

    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is a <strong>mistake</strong> that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this book, the word <term>"mistake"</term> doesn’t refer to something “bad”—it’s just a mistake in our expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
        A more formal term for a <term>mistake</term> would be a <term>"deviation from our expectations"</term>. We have expectations for how things should be, and sometimes things deviate from those expectations.
        </p>
<p>
    This isn’t about whether something is bad or good—it’s about whether something conforms to our expectations.
    </p>

<div class="for-instance">
<p class="for-instance">
    For instance:
    </p>
<p class="for-instance-text">
    Since we expect an egg to have one yolk, it’s a <term>deviation from our expectations</term> to find an egg with two yolks—or an egg with no yolk. Similarly, if we thought we knew the billing cost, it’s a <term>deviation from our expectations</term> to get an unexpected fee—or get an unexpected discount.
    </p>
<p class="for-instance-text">
    It doesn’t matter whether we feel these <term>deviations from our expectations</term> are good or bad. A <term>mistake</term> is only how our expectations compare to what we actually encounter.
    </p>
    </div>
<p>
    For now, we’ll be using these terms interchangeably (<term>mistake</term> = <term>deviation from our expectations</term>). We’ll mostly use “mistake,” since it’s shorter and less cumbersome.
    </p>
<p>
    We can look at some examples to see how we’ll be using <term>mistake</term> in this book:
    </p>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Justin and Heather are mountain biking when Justin flips on a root and tumbles down a small hill.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes> <speech>“Oh my god! Justin! Are you okay?”</speech> <narration>Heather calls, jumping off her bike and scrambling down to the body and bike below.</narration>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Timothy calls Jennifer.</narration> <speech>“Jennifer, I know Sam said otherwise, but I checked with the insurance company. They said the treatment is still experimental. They won’t cover it.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Yasmin realizes her boyfriend has been quiet for an hour. Didn’t he say he was just going to the kitchen for some leftovers? <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes> She suddenly has a bad feeling.</narration>

    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Lina gives him the finger on the way out.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Sam walks into the bedroom, tying his tie.</narration> <speech>“Jen, the kids were eaten by wolves.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Sabrina opens her email from her supervisor.</narration> <speech>“You’re being let go,”</speech> <narration>it says.</narration> <speech>“Don’t come in on Monday.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>

<p>
    The examples above aren’t examples of <term>humor</term>—they’re just examples of what we’re calling <term>mistakes</term>. 
    </p>
<p>
    The people in the examples had expectations, and something deviated from their expectations: a “mistake.”

        We labeled mistakes above based on the perspective of the people <em>in</em> the examples. These mistakes may or may not overlap with what we, as readers, feel are mistake. We’ll do this throughout this book.
