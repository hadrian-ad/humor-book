    What do we mean by "mistake"?
</h1>

       <p>
    The first part of our pattern of humor is a <vocab>mistake</vocab>.    </p>
   
    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is a <i>mistake</i> that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    
    <p>
   In this book, mistakes aren't something “bad”—they're just mistakes in our expectations:

    The examples above aren’t <term>examples</term> of <term>humor</term>—we're just looking at <em>examples</em> of what we're calling <em>mistakes</em>. Mistakes are just <sem-weak>one part</sem-weak> of our pattern of humor. 
    </p>


<div class="consider">
    
    <p class="consider">
        Consider:
        </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        We labeled mistakes above based on the perspective of the people <sem>in</sem> the examples. The <term>characters</term> thought they were mistakes&mdash;which may or may not overlap with what we, as <em>readers</em>, feel are mistakes. We’ll do this throughout this book.
        </p>
</div>


<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Expectations.</headline> 
            A more formal term for a mistake would be a <vocab>deviation from our expectations</vocab>. We have <term>expectations</term> for how things should be, and sometimes things <em>deviate</em> from those expectations.
            </p>
            
                <p>
        This isn't about whether something is good or bad—instead, it's about whether something conforms to our expectations.
        </p>
    
    <div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">
        For instance:
        </p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">
        Since we expect an egg to have <term>one</term> yolk, it’s a deviation from our expectations to find an egg with <em>two</em> yolks—or an egg with <em>no</em> yolk.</p> 
        
        <p class="for-instance-text">Similarly, if we thought we knew the <term>billing</term>, it’s a deviation from our expectations to get an unexpected <em>fee</em>—or get an unexpected <em>discount</em>.
        </p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">
        It doesn’t matter whether we feel these deviations from our expectations are good or bad. A mistake is when our expectations don't match what we actually encounter.
        </p>
        </div>
    <p>
        For now, we’ll be using these terms interchangeably <callback>(mistake = deviation from our expectations)</callback>. We’ll mostly use “mistake,” since it’s shorter and less cumbersome.
