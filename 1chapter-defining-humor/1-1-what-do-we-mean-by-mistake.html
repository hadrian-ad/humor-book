    What do we mean by "mistake"?
</h1>

    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is a <i>mistake</i> that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first part of our pattern of humor is a <vocab>mistake</vocab>. In this book, a mistake isn't something “bad”—it’s just a mistake in our expectations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A more formal term for a mistake would be a <vocab>deviation from our expectations</vocab>. We have expectations for how things should be, and sometimes things <sem>deviate</sem> from those expectations.
        </p>
        
            <p>
    This isn't about whether something is good or bad—instead, it's about whether something comforms to our expectations.
    </p>

<div class="for-instance">
<p class="for-instance">
    For instance:
    </p>
<p class="for-instance-text">
    Since we expect an egg to have <term>one</term> yolk, it’s a deviation from our expectations to find an egg with <em>two</em> yolks—or an egg with <em>no</em> yolk.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Similarly, if we thought we knew the <term>billing</term>, it’s a deviation from our expectations to get an unexpected <em>fee</em>—or get an unexpected <em>discount</em>.
    </p>
<p class="for-instance-text">
    It doesn’t matter whether we feel these deviations from our expections are good or bad. A mistake is only how our expectations compare to what we actually encounter.
    </p>
    </div>
<p>
    For now, we’ll be using these terms interchangeably <callback>(mistake = deviation from our expectations)</callback>. We’ll mostly use “mistake,” since it’s shorter and less cumbersome.
    </p>
<p>
    We can look at some examples to see how we’ll be using mistake in this book:
    </p>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Justin and Heather are mountain biking when Justin flips on a root and tumbles down a small hill.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes> <speech>“Oh my god! Justin! Are you okay?”</speech> <narration>Heather calls, jumping off her bike and scrambling down to the body and bike below.</narration>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Timothy calls Jennifer.</narration> <speech>“Jennifer, I know Sam said otherwise, but I checked with the insurance company. They said the treatment is still experimental. They won’t cover it.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Damien checks his pocket.</narration> <speech>“Where’s my wallet? Maybe I left it at the bus stop!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes> <narration>He gets off at the nearest stop and runs back, panicking.</narration>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Sara sits down disconsolately.</narration> <speech>“I can’t believe she’d cheat on me,”</speech> <narration>she says to herself.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Elias sees Jessica come in carrying a big box.</narration> <speech>“Jess, be careful, don’t knock the table…!”</speech> <narration>The table is bumped, and a clay statue falls over. One of the arms shatters.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Yasmin realizes her boyfriend has been quiet for an hour. Didn’t he say he was just going to the kitchen for some leftovers? <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes> She suddenly has a bad feeling.</narration>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Xiaowei is driving his friend Lina to the opening day of her play.</narration> <speech>“Break a leg!”</speech> <narration>Xiaowei says as he drops her off.</narration> <speech>“Also: You look nervous!”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Lina gives him the finger on the way out.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Sam walks into the bedroom, tying his tie.</narration> <speech>“Jen, the kids were eaten by wolves.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Sabrina opens her email from her supervisor.</narration> <speech>“You’re being let go,”</speech> <narration>it says.</narration> <speech>“Don’t come in on Monday.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>

<p>
    The examples above aren’t examples of <sem>humor</sem>—they’re just examples of the first part of our pattern of humor, which we're calling <vocab>mistakes</vocab>. 
    </p>
<p>
    The people in the examples had expectations, and something deviated from their expectations: a “mistake.”

    <p class="considertext">
        We labeled mistakes above based on the perspective of the people <sem>in</sem> the examples. These mistakes may or may not overlap with what we, as readers, feel are mistakes. We’ll do this throughout this book.
