    What do we mean by "mistake"?
</h1>

    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is a <i>mistake</i> that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    <p>
    The first part of our pattern of humor is a <vocab>mistake</vocab>. In this book, a mistake isn't something “bad”—it’s just a mistake in our expectations.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        A more formal term for a mistake would be a <vocab>deviation from our expectations</vocab>. We have <term>expectations</term> for how things should be, and sometimes things <em>deviate</em> from those expectations.
        </p>
        
            <p>
    This isn't about whether something is good or bad—instead, it's about whether something comforms to our expectations.
    </p>

<div class="for-instance">
<p class="for-instance">
    For instance:
    </p>
<p class="for-instance-text">
    Since we expect an egg to have <term>one</term> yolk, it’s a deviation from our expectations to find an egg with <em>two</em> yolks—or an egg with <em>no</em> yolk.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Similarly, if we thought we knew the <term>billing</term>, it’s a deviation from our expectations to get an unexpected <em>fee</em>—or get an unexpected <em>discount</em>.
    </p>
<p class="for-instance-text">
    It doesn’t matter whether we feel these deviations from our expections are good or bad. A mistake is when our expectations don't match what we actually encounter.
    </p>
    </div>
<p>
    For now, we’ll be using these terms interchangeably <callback>(mistake = deviation from our expectations)</callback>. We’ll mostly use “mistake,” since it’s shorter and less cumbersome.
    </p>
<p>
    We can look at some examples to see how we’ll be using mistake in this book:

<p>
    The examples above aren’t examples of <term>humor</term>—they’re just examples of the <sem>first part</sem> of our <em>pattern</em> of humor, which we're calling mistakes. 
    </p>
<p>
    The people in the examples had expectations, and something deviated from their expectations: a “mistake.”

    <p class="considertext">
        We labeled mistakes above based on the perspective of the people <sem>in</sem> the examples. The <term>characters</term> thought they were mistakes, which may or may not overlap with what <em>we</em>, as readers, feel are mistakes. We’ll do this throughout this book.
