<p>When do we smile and laugh? When we stop to think about it, we'll notice that we smile and laugh in a bewildering variety of contexts&mdash; including when we:</p>
      
   <ul class="close-list">
          <li> are given a compliment</li>
           <li>are insulted</li>
           <li>are hugged</li>
           <li>hear a joke</li>
           <li>receive a gift </li>
           <li>are kissed</li>
               <li>bike downhill</li>
           <li>come to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>put clothes on fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realize we've been foolish</li>
           <li>are pressured successfully</li>
           <li>feel a gust of wind</li>
           <li>finish a workout</li>
           <li>see a fox</li>
           <li>win a game</li>
           <li>lose badly</li>
           <li>enter a beautiful room</li>
           <li>see something disgusting</li>
           <li>recall an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
 
<p>To make matters more confusing, we sometimes <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> smile or laugh at these things. Other times, we even laugh at their opposites!</p>

<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We may laugh if we suceed <sem>or</sem> fail. On the other hand, we could also get upset when we succeed or fail instead.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">What's the pattern to all this, that explains the <term>presence</term> or <em>absence</em> of humor in <sem>all</sem> cases?</p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>In this chapter, we'll be looking at the <vocab>pattern</vocab> to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;which we can use to think through any instance of humor.</p> 
 
 <p>We'll introduce the basics of this pattern this chapter.</p> 
  
       
    <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Beginnings.</headline> Even though geometry starts at the beginning, it's not remedial instruction in "shapes"&mdash;it builds a practical foundation.</p> 
    
     <p> When students first take geometry, it can be strange to them to study something as simple and universal as a rectangle or triangle. And from one perspective, it's true&mdash;rectangles and triangles <sem-weak>are</sem-weak> simple, profoundly intuitive shapes.</p>
     
  <p>At the same time, there's more to learn about rectangles and triangles than students often suspect at the outset&mdash;and the study of angles and area opens up all kinds of practical skills.</p> 
     
      <p>We can think about smiling and laughing as similar.  Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction in humor. Instead, it's the beginning of something deeper than we might suspect at the outset&mdash;the "angles and area" to humor dynamics between people.</p>
      
      <p>This book assumes you have a lifetime of observations and experiences with humor, and then provides catalytic insight to organize it all in a coherent, workable system. </p>

   <div class="box">
        <p><headline>Scope.</headline> Even though we sometimes think about <term>humor</term> in terms of <term>comedy</term>, that can mistake a cart for a horse&mdash;a bit like trying to think about <em>eating</em> in terms of <em>restaurants</em>.</p>
        
        <p>If all restaurants disappeared tomorrow, people would still eat&mdash;just like if all comedies disappeared tomorrow, people would still laugh and smile. </p> 
        
        <p>This book will explain <sem>all</sem> instances of smiling and laughing&mdash;which will be inclusive to comedy, but also to everything else as well. </p>

<p>Let's look at a few examples:</p>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
 
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
       
                           
<div class="vignette">
 
<p>
 
    <narration>Alina is talking on the phone with her younger brother, Artem.</narration></p>
 	<p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“I’m sorry things are rough right now. Lots of people have troubles after high school. There’s no shame in being depressed. Listen, I have to go, but I’ll call you soon.”</speech> <action>*hangs up*</action> 

</p>

	<p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*sits back*</action> <internalaction>(thunderstruck)</internalaction> <speech>“I have depression!?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>“That makes so much sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”</speech>
 
</p> 
    </div>
                     
<p>Above, why did Yasmin and Artem laugh? We probably have an inuitive idea about this&mdash;but this intuition can be hard to put satisfyingly into words for even one instance of humor, let alone many.</p>
                                       
<p>Similarly, we know that humor marks an inflection of some kind in a situation&mdash;but this inflection too can be hard to express with confidence.</p> 
                     

   
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

    
            
 <p>We notice these dynamics all the time. People laugh or smile after:</p>
        
<p>Have you ever smiled or laughed after:</p>
          

       
       <p>Of course, people don't always laugh and smile at these things&mdash;so what's going on here? What's the shared pattern between all moments of smiling and laughing? And what <sem-weak>happens</sem-weak> in a situation because of humor?</p> 
          
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">When someone compliments us and we smile, something has happened in the situation. When we crest a hill and have a scenic view and we laugh, something has happened in the situation. What is it that's happening?</p>  
             
    </div>   
                        


   <p>         We'll start by describing the pattern to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;not just for jokes, but all across our lives. As we'll come to notice, we smile and laugh all across our lives:</p>
