       <p class="overtitle">Humor Pattern</p>
       
</div>

  <p>In this chapter, we'll be introducing the <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> of humor we'll be using throughout this book.</p>
   

    <p>Before looking at this pattern, we'll want to first notice <sem>all</sem> the places we smile or laugh. There's a bewildering variety! We might laugh when we:</p>
      
   <ul class="close-list">
          <li> are given a compliment</li>
           <li>are insulted</li>
           <li>are hugged</li>
           <li>hear a joke</li>
           <li>receive a gift </li>
           <li>are kissed</li>
               <li>bike downhill</li>
           <li>come to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>put clothes on fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realize we've been foolish</li>
           <li>are pressured successfully</li>
           <li>feel a gust of wind</li>
           <li>finish a workout</li>
           <li>see a fox</li>
           <li>win a game</li>
           <li>lose badly</li>
           <li>enter a beautiful room</li>
           <li>see something disgusting</li>
           <li>recall an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
 
<p>To make matters more confusing, we sometimes <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> smile or laugh at these things, or laugh at their opposites.</p>

<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we <term>fail</term>, we <sem-weak>may</sem-weak> laugh&mdash;but we may become angry instead. The same is true of its ostensible opposite: if we <em>succeed</em>, we <sem-weak>may</sem-weak> laugh&mdash;but in some cases we may become angry instead.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">What's the pattern to all this, that explains the presence or absence of humor in <sem>all</sem> cases?</p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>We can find an elegant pattern to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> there's humor&mdash;which can be used to think through any instance of smiling and laughing. We'll introduce the basics of this pattern this chapter.</p> 
  
   
<div class="box">
        <p><headline>Scope.</headline> We sometimes think about <term>humor</term> in terms of <term>comedy</term>. That's mistaking a cart for a horse&mdash;a bit like trying to think about <em>eating</em> in terms of <em>restaurants</em>.</p>
        
        <p>If all restaurants disappeared tomorrow, there would still be eating&mdash;just like if all jokes and funny movies disappeared tomorrow, there would still be smiling and laughing.</p> 
        
        <p>We're sometimes so focused on comedy that we lose track of all the places we smile and laugh&mdash;most of which have no relation to comedy. All this can lead to strange explanations of humor dynamics.</p>
        
        <p>In this book, we'll be explaining why we smile and laugh <sem>anywhere</sem>&mdash;which will be inclusive to comedy, but also to everything else as well.</p>

    <!--  
<p>Let's look at a few examples:</p>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
 
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
       
                           
<div class="vignette">
 
<p>
 
    <narration>Alina is talking on the phone with her younger brother, Artem.</narration></p>
 	<p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“I’m sorry things are rough right now. Lots of people have troubles after high school. There’s no shame in being depressed. Listen, I have to go, but I’ll call you soon.”</speech> <action>*hangs up*</action> 

</p>

	<p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*sits back*</action> <internalaction>(thunderstruck)</internalaction> <speech>“I have depression!?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>“That makes so much sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”</speech>
 
</p> 
    </div>
                     
<p>Above, why did Yasmin and Artem laugh? We probably have an inuitive idea about this&mdash;but this intuition can be hard to put satisfyingly into words for even one instance of humor, let alone many.</p>
                                       
<p>Similarly, we know that humor marks an inflection of some kind in a situation&mdash;but this inflection too can be hard to express with confidence.</p> 
                     

   
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

    
            
 <p>We notice these dynamics all the time. People laugh or smile after:</p>
        
<p>Have you ever smiled or laughed after:</p>
          

       
       <p>Of course, people don't always laugh and smile at these things&mdash;so what's going on here? What's the shared pattern between all moments of smiling and laughing? And what <sem-weak>happens</sem-weak> in a situation because of humor?</p> 
          
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">When someone compliments us and we smile, something has happened in the situation. When we crest a hill and have a scenic view and we laugh, something has happened in the situation. What is it that's happening?</p>  
             
    </div>   
                        


   <p>         We'll start by describing the pattern to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;not just for jokes, but all across our lives. As we'll come to notice, we smile and laugh all across our lives:</p>
