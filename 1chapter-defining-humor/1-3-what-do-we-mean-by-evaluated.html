<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>
<!--    01.30 -->

<p class="lesson">Humor is a mistake that’s <i>evaluated</i> as OK.</p>

    <p>The last part of our pattern is the word <vocab>evaluated</vocab>. In this book, we'll use the word similarly to how we use it in day-to-day conversation. </p>

<p>This word "evaluated" adds a person to our pattern: someone has to do the evaluating.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
        <p class="considertext">Does a book of jokes sitting on a shelf have any humor in it? Not according to our pattern of humor—since no one is currently <sem>evaluating</sem> the jokes. There can only be humor if someone is evaluating the jokes.</p>
</div>

    <p>The word evaluation is like a hinge, where mistakes can swivel to OK or to not-OK. This lets our pattern describe when humor does and <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> occur. We can see this in some examples:</p>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Timothy calls Jennifer.</narration> <speech>“Jennifer, I know Sam said otherwise, but I checked with the insurance company. They said the treatment is still experimental. They won’t cover it.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes></p>
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Jennifer is silent for a second. Then she laughs, exhausted.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is evaluated as OK)</notes> <speech>“That’s what I thought. If we hold a fundraiser, I think we should still be able to cover it.”</speech></p>
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Jennifer is silent for a second. Then she starts to cry.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the mistake is evaluated as not OK)</notes> <speech>“Oh my god. What are we going to do?”</speech></p>

<p>These examples help us see how an evaluation is something that someone does that pivots them toward humor or not-humor.

   <div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">Humor doesn't only happen—humor also <outcome-contrast>doesn't</outcome-contrast> happen. We’ll be learning as much about the humor that doesn’t happen as we do about the humor that does.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">That's because in order to understand why we sometimes laugh at jokes, hugs, failure, and so on—we also have to understand why we sometimes don’t laugh at them.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">By the end of this book, we’ll be as comfortable explaining the <term>presence</term> of laughter as we are explaining the <em>absence</em> of laughter.</p>

      <p><headline>Models.</headline> We introduced the bones of our <term>model definition</term> of humor. A model simplifies something more complex to help us approximate, characterize, describe, or predict outcomes. This is a lot like how maps are simplifications of what they're mapping.</p>
       
       <p>But no matter how useful a map is, it’s not actually the land its mapping. Our model definition of humor is similar: it’s not humor—just a model of it. As we add to this model, it'll become increasingly useful for creating, describing, and predicting humor at a day-to-day scale of thinking.</p>
