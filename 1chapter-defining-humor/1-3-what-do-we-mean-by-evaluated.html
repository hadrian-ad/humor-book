<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>
<!--    01.30 -->

 <p>The last part of our pattern is the word <vocab>evaluated</vocab>.</p>

<p class="lesson">Humor is a mistake that’s <i>evaluated</i> as OK.</p>



    <p>The word evaluation is like a hinge, where mistakes can swivel to OK or to not-OK. This lets our pattern describe when humor does and <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> occur:</p>

<p>These examples help us see how an evaluation is something that someone does that pivots them toward humor or not-humor.

        <p class="considertext">This word "evaluated" adds a person to our pattern: someone has to do the evaluating.</p>
       
       <p class="considertext">Does a book of jokes sitting on a shelf have any humor in it? Not according to our pattern of humor—since no one is currently <sem-weak>evaluating</sem-weak> the jokes. Humor is only possible if someone is evaluating the jokes.</p>

            <p>That's because we won't be able to fully understand why we sometimes laugh at jokes, hugs, failure, and so on without also have to understand why we sometimes <outcome-contrast>don’t</outcome-contrast> laugh at them.</p> 
            
            <p>That's why we’ll be as comfortable explaining the <term>presence</term> of laughter as we are explaining the <em>absence</em> of laughter by the end of this book.</p>

      <p><headline>Models.</headline> We introduced the bones of our <term>model definition</term> of humor.

       <p>But no matter how useful a map is, it’s not actually the land its mapping. Our model definition of humor is similar: it’s not humor—just a model of it. As we add to this model, it'll become increasingly useful for creating, describing, and predicting humor at a day-to-day scale of thinking.</p>

    <p>We're putting together a <vocab>model definition</vocab> of humor. A model is something that approximates, characterizes, describes, or predicts outcomes. Models do this by simplifying something more complex&mdash;like how maps work.</p>

<p>A map you can hold in your hand is a useful approximation of thousands of square miles of a country. But even if a map of a country is <term>useful</term>, that doesn't mean that map is actually the <term>country</term>. Similarly, a model of humor may be <em>useful</em>, but that doesn't mean the model is actually <em>humor</em>&mdash;just a model of it.</p> 

       <div class="consider">
     <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
           <p class="considertext">Sometimes we get so used to models that we start thinking they're actually the thing they're modeling&mdash;which is a bit like confusing a portrait of a person with the person themselves. If we do this, we may even make strange errors, like criticizing that person for not looking like their portrait.</p>
    
      </div>   
            
<p>Some models are very complex and require computing to use. But our particular model is meant to be used just with a bit of thought. Our final goal is to develop an intuitive use of this model, so it's not really something we have to think about.</p>

        <p>We introduced our model definition of humor. This model uses two input parameters: a mistake and an OK. We also described these inputs as coming from a person—they're evaluations.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <strong><a href="1-1-what-do-we-mean-by-mistake.html#exclude-navigation">mistake</a></strong> is something that deviates from our expectations. A mistake isn't "good" or "bad"—it's just about how something relates to our expectations.</li>
    <li>Our <strong><a href="1-2-what-do-we-mean-by-ok.html#exclude-navigation">OK</a></strong> is how secure we feel from personal negative consequences. An OK doesn't mean we're "okay with" something bad happening. It's just how we're relating ourselves to negative consequences.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="1-3-what-do-we-mean-by-evaluated.html#exclude-navigation">Evaluations</a></strong> create these mistakes and OK. This means someone is required for there to be humor. Without an evaluator, there's no mistake or OK—and so can't be humor.</li>
