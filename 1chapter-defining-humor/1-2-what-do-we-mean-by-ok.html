    What do we mean by "OK"?
</h1>
    
<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as <strong>OK</strong>.
    </p>

<p>
    In this book, the word <term>OK</term> doesn't refer to something "good"—instead, it refers to someone's personal relation to consequences.
    </p>
<p>
    A more formal term for <term>OK</term> would be <term>"secure from negative personal consequences"</term>. As we observe things, we pay attention to how those observations will personally affect us.
    </p>
<p>
    This isn’t about whether something is good or bad—it's just about our sense of security to negative personal consequences.
    </p>
    
<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">
        For instance:
        </p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">
        If we hear a building collapses two thousand miles away from us, we may feel it’s <term>OK</term>—because we feel we are <term><strong>personally</strong> secure from negative consequences</term>. This doesn’t mean we’re “okay” that it happened! All our <term>OK</term> here means is that, based on how we understand the situation, the possibility of <em>personal</em> consequences seems remote.
        </p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">
        By contrast, if the building next door to us collapsed, or a building collapsed in the city our best friend lived in, we won’t feel <term><strong>personally</strong> secure from negative consequences</term>—and it would be <em>not</em> <term>OK</term>.
        </p>
</div>
<p>
    We’ll be using both terms interchangeably (<term>OK</term> = <term>secure from negative personal consequences</term>). We’ll mostly use “OK,” since it’s shorter and less cumbersome. 
    </p>
<p>
    We can look at some examples of <term>mistakes</term> being evaluated as <term>OK</term>:

    <p class="vig-indent">
        <narration>She goes to check on him in the kitchen. Trevor’s at the table with look of extreme concentration, trying to stack grapes. Many are on the floor.

    In all these examples, people felt that a mistake was OK. They encountered something that was a <term>deviation from their expectations</term>. When they felt they were <term>personally secure from negative consequences</term>, they reacted with humor.
