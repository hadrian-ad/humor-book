Different humor profiles</h2>

        <!--
<p>Last chapter, we tracked different evaluations for spectators, characters, and the actors playing those characters:</p>
        

        <div class="vignette">
   
   <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer are acting out a scene where Sam realizes he forget to buy the cream cheese with green onion, and tries to charm his way out of it.</narration></p> 
   
   <p><narration>Jennifer and Sam concentrate on acting, as their characters act stand-offish. As Sam gets up on the table, the audience laughs.</narration></p>

<p>When put side-by-side, we can often distinguish between an actor <term>acting</term> humor  <callback>(spectator humor profile)</callback> and an actor's own <em>feelings</em> of humor <callback>(personal humor profile)</callback>:</p>

title="Spectator humor profile versus personal humor profiles"
alt="This image has two columns to compare spectator humor profiles and personal humor profiles. One the left, an actor playing Han Solo smirks roguishly (spectator humor profile). On the right, the actor himself, Harrison Ford, smiles between takes, which looks full and real (personal humor profile)."

title="Personal humor profiles"
alt="Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are in costume as Luke Skywalker and Princees Leia. However, it's clear by the way they're smiling and laughing that it's the people feeling humor and not them acting a character. An annotation says 'we can tell these are personal humor profiles, and not spectator humor profiles."

<p>In the images above, we can tell when the actors are <term>pretending</term> humor <callback>(spectator humor profile)</callback>, and when they're <em>feeling</em> humor <callback>(personal humor profile)</callback>.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
    <p class="considertext"><term>Pretended</term> evaluations are less vividly presented than our <em>actual</em> evaluations&mdash;which is true for all our emotions.</p> 

         
    <p class="considertext">In the same way pretended <term>humor</term> is less vivid than actual humor, pretended <em>surprise</em> is less vivid than actual surprise.</p>

<p><headline>Vividness.</headline> We often don't notice how flat humor is in movies until it's pointed out. Then it can be hard to unsee!</p>
   
<p>Often, we make judge humor in spectator entertainment relative to that piece of work. If we watch <book-title>Lord of the Rings</book-title>, the characters rarely feel humor&mdash;the series is coherent to this surreal premise.</p>
  
<p>That makes small smiles seem vivid <sem-weak>in that movie</sem-weak>&mdash;since they sharply contrast with the rest of the emotional premise:</p>
   
<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Trevor is watching <book-title>The Return of the King</book-title>.</narration></p>
    
     <p><speaker>Pippin:</speaker> <action>*leaning on balcony*</action> <internalaction>(worried)</internalaction> <speech>"Is there any hope for Frodo and Sam?"</speech></p>
      
      <p><speaker>Gandalf:</speaker> <action>*leans on balcony*</action> <speech>"There never was much hope."</speech> <action>*eyes twinkling*</action> <internalaction>(smiling)</internalaction> <speech>"Just a fool's hope."</speech></p>
           
    <p><speaker>Pippin</speaker>: <action>*small smile*</action> <notes>(&larr;Pippin feels low-intensity <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on)</notes>  </p>
            
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*thinking*</action> "God, I love Gandalf."</p>   
            </div> 
   
<p>Many of Trevor's favorite memories from that film are where Gandalf smiles or makes Trevor smile. This makes Trevor remember Gandalf as having vivid humor.</p>

<p>But it's worth seperating what's vivid <term>relative to the movie</term>&mdash;and how that actually compares relative <em>to our own lives</em>.</p>
