Laughter makes things emotionally vivid

<p>We often find the most resonant parts of spectator entertainment to be scenes of characters laughing together:</p>

<p>Above, characters briefly balance mistakes and OKs, which allows them to feel mutual <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>This variety of humor family words, shared between two people, makes the scene feel emotionally rich to Owen. The way the characters share an evaluatory transitions feels meaningful, coherent, relatable, and integrated.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            
    <p class="considertext">Owen enjoys watching Rick and Zeep bond <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> because it says anything profound about addiction or other subjects&mdash;but because their shared laughter creates an emotional interrelation that supports a more engaging story.</p>   
    
    <p class="considertext">For instance, the emotional "plot" of the episode includes enemies becoming friends becoming enemies again. Part of the intensity of this emotional plot relies on their shared humor in this moment.</p>

    <p>Since it's hard for live-action characters to laugh convincingly on-screen, let alone laughing together&mdash;these emotionally resonant scenes tend to either be flat or absent from live-action.</p>

        Since it's easier to have animated characters laugh together, we more often experience this richness in animated shows than live

<p><headline>Translation.</headline> Laughter is one barrier to creating a live-action versions of various media. There's no physical way to do Homer Simpson's laugh in live-action!</p> 

               
<p>This ends up making many live adaptions of animation things feel flat compared to the original&mdash;since its the <sem-weak>laughing</sem-weak> that provides a lot of the depth of emotional connection to the character.</p>
     
     <p>Note that this is true of any emotional expression&mdash;like crying, where random sounds can effectively be superimposed over animation without having to be particularly realistic.</p>

    Do people go <callback>"ha ha ha?"</callback> Not really&mdash;not any more than cars go <callback>"vroom!"</callback> or falling pancakes go <callback>"splat!"</callback></p> 
    
     <p>That's why people in the United States tend to write <callback>"ha ha ha,"</callback> but many people in Europe tend to write <callback>"ah ah ah" </callback>instead&mdash;and why the convention in Brazil for a while was to write <callback>"kkkkkkk."</callback> Since these are just conventions for indicating laughter, so they vary.</p> 
     
    
    <div class="consider">
        Consider:
            <p class=considertext>What sound do cats make? English speakers say cats go <callback>"meow,"</callback> but German speakers say cats go <callback>"miau,"</callback>&mdash;and Japanese speakers <callback>"nya."</callback></p> 
            
            <p class=considertext>These aren't meant to be "real" noises cats make&mdash;since cats make all kinds of nontranscribable noises. Instead, <callback>"meow,"</callback> <callback>"miau,"</callback> <callback>"nya,"</callback> and so on are just abstract conventions. It's the same with written laughter.</p>
    </div>
                       
    <p>There's no exact way to transcribe even a single instance of laughing&mdash;let alone one way to transcribe <sem-weak>all</sem-weak> the variations of a laugh. Something  like <callback>"ha ha ha"</callback> is just how some <sem-weak>reference</sem-weak> laughter in writing.</p>
                        
   
    
    <p>Sometimes people take these conventions too seriously. <callback>"Moo"</callback> is the written word for the noises cows makes&mdash;which isn't how a cow literally sounds. But if we take written conventions too seriously, we start expecting cows to literally be saying <callback>"moo"</callback> over and over again&mdash;which is a bit like expecting a pancake to say <callback>"splat!"</callback> when it falls onto the floor.</p>
        
<p>Something similar happens with laughter. Actors sometimes literally say <callback>"ha ha ha"</callback> because that's how it's written&mdash;like how Santa actors will often literally say <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> because that's how it's written.</p> 
            
    <p><callback>"Ho ho ho"</callback> was a written convention for Santa, since it conveyed more of a good-natured, full-body laugh than other vowels. <callback>("Ha ha ha," "huh huh huh," "hee hee hee," and so on.</callback>) But actually <sem>saying</sem> <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> aloud instead of laughing is a bit odd—like an actor literally saying <callback>"zzz"</callback> when pretending to sleep, or a video editor adding the spoken word <callback>"bam!"</callback> to the sound of a discharging gun.</p>
       
    <p>There's nothing inherently wrong with saying <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback>—since, like any spectator humor profile, <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> serves various purposes outside of being realistic. However, <sem>we</sem> can be wrong if we lose sight that these spectator humor profiles are surreal&mdash;and not literally laughter.</p>

<p>Surreal things have constraints in how they present humor. These create medium-specific humor patterns. These various patterns are "spectator humor profiles," which allow those mediums to convey evaluatory information.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>We can usually distinquish between spontaneous reactions, and reactions done for a goal-oriented purpose done for others. </li>
  
   <li>When we become familiar with different <a href="11-00-spectator-humor-profiles.html">spectator humor profiles</a>, they start seeming normal&mdash;but normal is different than "real." These spectator humor profiles aren't perfect mirrors of our lives&mdash;they're surreal.
   </li>

            In part because , live-action shows often focus around mistake-predominant emotions instead of humor, in part because they struggle to convincingly present nuanced, intense humor.
            
            It's harder to do scenes with shared laughter in live-action scenes than in animated scenes&mdash;not only do live-action actors have less leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laugh, but <sem>then</sem> have to do so convincingly on set and on camera!</p>

<p>We interpret the repetitive noises the voice actor is making as laughter—but it's not actually laughing, just repetitive random noises! (We can see this for ourselves by imitating Frink's laughter.)</p>

<p>In fact, almost any kind of repetitive noise we make could be superimposed over an animated character laughing, and be interpreted by others as laughing—even though it's actually just a random repetitive noise!</p>

<p>This kind of shared laughter is relatively harder to do well in live shows than animated shows. Voice actors have more leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laughs, which they can then do consistently. These laughs are often one of our strongest point of recall for them.</p>


<p>The presence of nuanced and varied laugh-like noises gives animated shows a feeling of emotional finesse and relatability that's often lacking in film.</p>

<p>For instance, in this clip two characters who were at first testy rivals have been forced to collaborate and develop mutual respect for each other. With a larger OK and understanding of each other, they share faults that generate large mistakes&mdash;generating humor. They feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>Since animated shows have an easier time displaying intensity, duration, and lean toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance, we experience them as having emotional depth. A live action show would struggle to convincingly display intense humor like this, making the emotional activity feel flat. </p>


</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Example #2 (Film):</button>
   
   <div class="content-example">

<p>We find distinctive spectator laughs to be memorable and relatable, whether in film or animation. In this clip one character has a memorable, non-standard spectator laugh, while the other has a forgettable, standard spectator laugh:</p> 


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVXU6p2QaKU?si=S7DP0e7ojluw0AYg&amp;end=21" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>One one hand, the distinctive laugh is <term>familiar</term> to our lives, since we hear distinctive laughs like this relatively frequently. On the other hand, it's <em>unfamiliar</em> to movies, since we rarely hear laughs like this from main characters that aren't part of an explicit gag. In the end, the unusual laugh makes the character relatable and memorable.
