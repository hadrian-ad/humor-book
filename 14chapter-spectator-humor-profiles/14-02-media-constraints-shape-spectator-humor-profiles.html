Priorities that shape humor profiles
</h2>

<p>Spectator entertainment makes choices about how it wants to convey evaluatory information.</p>
 
 <p>A movie doesn't have to prioritize realism of humor&mdash;instead a movie may:</p>

<ul>
     
       <li><sem>Prioritize pacing.</sem> When we laugh in conversation, the laughter may take up a substantial proportion of the conversation. But for pacing reasons, movies don't want laughter to take up the same proportion of a scene.</li>
     
     <li><sem>Prioritize camera shots.</sem>
      If a movie wants a clear shot of a face, the director will instruct the actor not to put their hands near their heads when pretending to laugh. This prevents a common humor tell from being present in many scenes:</li>

      alt="This image has two photos of actor Harrison Ford. On the left, Harrison Ford laughs behind the scenes, his hand curled near his head. On the right, he acts his character, Han Solo, smirking with his hands held wide. Annotations note that a hand held by the head for humor may interfere with a director's composition of the scene."

    <p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds long&mdash;10% of the scene!</p>

    <p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>

     <li><sem>Prioritize characterization.</sem> In a <term>movie</term>, it can be charming to see the roguish character smirk as they receive an award&mdash;but it can be off-putting in <term>real life</term>. In reverse, it can be charming to see someone beam at an award ceremony in <em>real life</em>, but might feel like weak characterization in a <em>movie</em>: </li>

An annotation says that the normal smile looks goofy on a camera (even though it would look normal in conversation), while the acted smile looks good on camera (even though it would be offputting in conversation)."

    <li>
      <sem>Prioritize what's flattering on camera.</sem> Genuine smiles contort our faces. Some movies rarely let actors or characters <sem-weak>blink</sem-weak> on screen, let alone scrunch their eyes when they smile. Movies often avoid normal humor tells as a stylistic choice:</li>

      >        
     
    <li><sem>Prioritize storytelling.</sem> As we watch a movie, we may register a smile as fitting the themes, character arcs, music, romance, and so on. But when we imagine many movie smiles happening in <em>real life</em>, they can seem odd:</li>

   <!--
   <p>All these priorities shape how humor is presented in spectator entertainment.</p> 
   
   <div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">There's nothing wrong with <term>movies</term>  using <term>spectator humor profiles</term>&mdash;for the same reason there's nothing wrong with <em>portraits</em> using <em>paint</em>. Without paint, it wouldn't be a painting!    
    </p>
  
       <p class="considertext">Instead, <sem-weak>we</sem-weak> can be wrong if we assume that movies are straightforward mirrors of real life. Movies have constraints and goals that aren't simply realism for realism's sake.</p>
  
                 </div> 
  -->
  
  <div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Sometimes we think movies are <sem-weak>supposed</sem-weak> to show realistic humor&mdash;but movies aren't trying to be realistic for realism's sake.</p>
     
    <p class="for-instance-text">It's obvious that <book-title>Star Wars</book-title> isn't trying to present realistic <term>space battles</term> for realism's sake&mdash;realism isn't the priority!</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">For exactly the same reason, movies aren't trying to present realistic <em>emotions</em> for realism's sake&mdash;realism also isn't the priority.</p>

</div>
  
  
<div class="box"><p><headline>Limitations.</headline> One reason spectator humor profiles are so distinct is that we simply can't convincingly act out medium-intensity humor or higher on command!</p>
     
<p>We can't convincingly act out our <term>own</term> laugh on command&mdash;let alone imitate someone <em>else's</em> laughter. While we can sometimes caricature, we can't convincingly replicate intense laughter.</p> 
     
<p>Directors and actors will shape presentations of humor to what is physically possible to do&mdash;so if a lead actor can't act out laughter, it won't be scripted. We don't always notice this about movies, once it's pointed out it's hard to unsee!</p>
    </div>
  
  
  <!--
    <p class="considertext">That's because what we enjoy is often inverted between spectator entertainment and real life. A smirk can be fun in a movie <callback>(but infuriating in real life)</callback>, just like an open-eyed, tight smile can be nice in a movie <callback>(but unsettling in real life)</callback>.</p>

<h2>Movies prioritize their own goals</h2>
    
 <div class="h2"> 
     
 <p>Movies make choices prioritizing their audience&mdash;and so how humor is pretended is in service of a variety of other goals other than realism for realism's sake.</p>
    
    <p>We can see this in a movie like <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title>:</p>

title="Pretending realistic humor contorts our face"
alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 23rem ; margin-left: "
>

     
<p>Early in the movie, the actor pretends more realistic humor in order to:</p>
      
<ul class="close-list">
     <li>make Jane feel relatable</li>
     <li>establish Jane's ease and freedom with laughing</li>
      <li>to show her close connection to her sister</li>
      <li>contrast with the formal and awkward Mr. Darcy</li>
      <li>set her emotional baseline for the rest of the story to measure against</li>
      </ul>
          
  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
  
<p>At the conclusion, when Jane and Mr. Darcy share smiles, the production team has the actor linger in the shot with an unrealistic smile in order to:</p>
 
  <ul class="close-list">   
      <li>let the audience take in the actor's face</li>
      <li>draw out an emotional note for pacing</li>
      <li>support the soundtrack</li>
      <li>complete an arc toward a mature happiness</li>
      <li>move the story toward a happily-ever-after conclusion</li>
      <li>better match the character's  emotional cadence to show closeness</li>
                </ul>
     
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
  
      <p>The creators of this movie didn't just tell the actor to smile and laugh. Instead, they told her to smile and laugh in specific ways that harmonized with  overall goals.</p>

  <p class="considertext">Movies are straightforward examples of spectator entertainment. But we can use movies as a baseline to see how this is something we encounter <sem-weak>everywhere</sem-weak>, including the:</p>

      <p>When choosing our senior photo, we don't usually chose the photo that <term>felt</term> best being taken&mdash;but the one that <em>looked </em>best, to spectators.</p>
        
      <p>A picture of us beaming and sitting with friends on a ratty couch may capture us at our interpersonal best&mdash;but it doesn't prioritize the goals of senior photo.</p> 
      
      <p>That's why we we probably took a stilted photo of us in ways we'd never behave in real life&mdash;maybe with a contorted torso and arms crossed in ways that felt awkward but looked good <sem-weak>for a picture</sem-weak>.</p>
      
  <p>Movies and shows are essentially like this always, where they always present humor in a way that looks good on camera but that would be very odd in real life.</p>
