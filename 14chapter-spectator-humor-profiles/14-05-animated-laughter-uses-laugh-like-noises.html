Animated laughter
</h1>

<p>If we recorded a hundred people laughing, we’d have a hundred different laughs&mdash;since everyone has a distinctive laugh.</p> 

<p>Despite this, unless they're part of a gag, we rarely hear distinctive laughs in live-action movies.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext"> Outside of conventional noises <callback>("mwa-ha-hah!")</callback> Characters in movies tend to have generic and forgettable pretend laughter. (<callback>“Hah!”</callback> or <callback>“hahahaha!”</callback>)</p>

<p>It's not surprising that laughs in spectator entertainment are often used to generate humor! They're places where mistakes and OKs can easily be balanced. We have strong expectations for laughs, and deviations from those expectations can easily be made to feel free of consequence for the spectator.</p>

<p>But while <term>live-action</term> spectator entertainment doesn't often have memorable or unique laughs, <em>animated</em> spectator entertainment often <sem>does</sem> have unique or memorable laughs.</p>

    <p>Even though we interpret characters in animated spectator entertainment as <term>laughing</term>, the actors are more often than not just making <em>noises</em>.</p>
    
     <p>That's because just about <sem-weak>any</sem-weak> repetitive noises will be interpreted as laughter when superimposed over cartoon animations of laughter.</p>
 
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
     
     <p class="considertext">This gives voice actors practical leeway to create distinctive vocal characterizations. They can make just about any sound, and not worry about how they look making them!</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">This is different than an actor, who has to laugh while also remaining visually normal to audiences.</p>
     </div>
     
 <p>We relate to characters with coherent, vivid, and individualized spectator humor profiles. That's one reason we find animated characters to be emotionally responsive and relatable&mdash;they laugh a lot, and distinctively!</p> 
       
       <p>Sitcom characters often feel more emotionally flat in comparison&mdash;they rarely laugh, and when they do it's often artificially generic.

<p>We interpret the repetitive noises the voice actor is making as laughter&mdash;but it's not actually laughing, just repetitive random noises! (We can see this for ourselves by imitating Frink's laughter.)</p>

<p>In fact, almost any kind of repetitive noise we make could be superimposed over an animated character laughing, and be interpreted by others as laughing&mdash;even though it's actually just a random repetitive noise!</p>

   <div class="content-example">


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pxrz2pzHEG4?si=qUHbIB3pDyyucTd-&amp;start=94&amp;end=107" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This kind of shared laughter is relatively harder to do well in live shows than animated shows. Voice actors have more leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laughs, which they can then do consistently. These laughs are often one of our strongest point of recall for them.</p>


<p>The presence of nuanced and varied laugh-like noises gives animated shows a feeling of emotional finesse and relatability that's often lacking in film.</p>

<p>For instance, in this clip two characters who were at first testy rivals have been forced to collaborate and develop mutual respect for each other. With a larger OK and understanding of each other, they share faults that generate large mistakes&mdash;generating humor. They feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>Since animated shows have an easier time displaying intensity, duration, and lean toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance, we experience them as having emotional depth. A live action show would struggle to convincingly display intense humor like this, making the emotional activity feel flat. </p>


</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Example #2 (Film):</button>
   
   <div class="content-example">

<p>We find distinctive spectator laughs to be memorable and relatable, whether in film or animation. In this clip one character has a memorable, non-standard spectator laugh, while the other has a forgettable, standard spectator laugh:</p> 


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVXU6p2QaKU?si=S7DP0e7ojluw0AYg&amp;end=21" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>One one hand, the distinctive laugh is <term>familiar</term> to our lives, since we hear distinctive laughs like this relatively frequently. On the other hand, it's <em>unfamiliar</em> to movies, since we rarely hear laughs like this from main characters that aren't part of an explicit gag. In the end, the unusual laugh makes the character relatable and memorable.

<p><headline>Memorability.</headline> Live-action characters sometimes have memorable <term>humor tells</term>, like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
        
        <li>Han Solo’s lopsided smile</li> 
        <li>Fox Mulder’s enthusiastic grin</li>
        <li>James Bond’s smirk</li> 
        <li>Harry Potter’s shy smile</li>
        <li>Jack Sparrow's half-of-face smile</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>It's probably harder to remember scenes of these characters <sem-weak>laughing</sem-weak>&mdash;because it's hard to create a signature laugh for a live-action character.</p>

<p>When we watch these characters, we'll find their laughs are mostly forgettable&mdash;more like an abstract cue, similar to how a novel might say <callback>"he laughed."</callback></p>
  
  <p>By contrast, some animated characters like Homer Simpson or Rick Sanchez have an iconic laugh that fans would instantly recognize&mdash;which isn't something that could be said of most famous live-action characters.</p>
