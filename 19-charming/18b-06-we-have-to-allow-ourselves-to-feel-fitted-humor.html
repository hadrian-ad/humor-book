    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charmingness is often a two-way street</h1>   
    
 
<p>To be charming, it’s not enough to make <term>others</term> feel fitted humor&mdash;we have to allow <em>ourselves</em> to feel fitted humor too.</p>

<p>Zoe’s goal isn’t to make Sara feel humor while herself emotionally guarding against humor&mdash;instead, Zoe has to <sem>also</sem> express humor when Sara tries to be charming in return.</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sara sets her backpack down and admires Zoe’s plants.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <speech>“You’ve always done such a good job with your plants. I can barely keep that succulent you gave me alive, let alone look after twenty pots!”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*embarrassed*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> allow herself to feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe <outcome-contrast>declines</outcome-contrast> charm&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes> <internalaction>(deflecting)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh, it’s not a big deal, they’re just plants.”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe allows herself to feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe accepts charm&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <internalaction>(deflecting)</internalaction> <speech>“Well. Thanks! It’s not that big a deal after a while, they’re just plants.”</speech></p>

<p>Over time, <sem>mutual</sem> fitted humor allows for <sem>mutual</sem> feelings of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mdash;which accomplishes Zoe’s goal of mutually renewing their friendship.</p>

<p>This is why Zoe defaults to prioritizing <term>fittedness</term> instead of <em>intensity</em>. Fittedness is more in-line than her long-term objectives than intensity is by itself.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Default.</headline> Sometimes we default to <term>comedy</term> attempts, like if we fall into jester or class clown roles, or develop a habit of undercutting moments of <emotions>connection</emotions> or <emotions>delight</emotions>. When this is our default, we sometimes run into awkward moments, hurt others, or don't develop close connections with others. </p>
    
     
      <p>That's why we usually have the best outcomes when we default to <em>charm</em> attempts, since fitted humor is what allows us to have functioning and enjoyable experiences with each other. It allows us to develop reflexes that go toward generating mutually felt <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>Defaulting to charm doesn't mean we give up  comedy attempts&mdash;it just means we don't reflexively make them. This gives us the space to pick and choose when we make comedy attempts, minimizing the bad outcomes or wasted opportunities that can happen when comedy attempts are made thoughtlessly.</p>
