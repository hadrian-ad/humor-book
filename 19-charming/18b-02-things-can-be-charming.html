    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Things can be charming</h1>   

<p>We can find anything charming. We can frequently feel fitted humor around people, but also around:</p> 
  
<ul class="close-list">
     <li>events</li>
      <li>festivals</li>
      <li>flowers</li>
      <li>metaphors</li>
      <li>packaging</li>
      <li>places</li>
       <li>sound effects</li>
      <li>typography</li>
      <li>user interfaces</li>
      <li>walks</li>
      </ul>
   
   <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
  <p>These things can have a charm-quality, since they tilt us toward humor outcomes.</p>
      
<p>We find all kinds of things charming:</p>

    <p>We feel humor from these things for the same reason we've seen throughout this book. When we encounter them we tend to:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list">
       <li>shift our evaluations of mistakes and OK into balance</li>
        
        <li>have opportunity and reason to <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, feel <humor-tell>optimistic</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>lose situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on</li>
        
        <li>feel <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on</li>
        
        <li>are able to <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>feel an argument has support</humor-outcome>, and so on</li>
        </ul>

    <p>When this happens many time in association with something, we can describe that thing as charming.</p>  
            
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
           
        <p class="considertext">
        We said that fitted humor is socially effective and connective, which is why charming people seem socially effective and connective.</p> 
        
         
        <p class="considertext">Of course, the same is true not just of <term>people</term>, but of <em>anything</em>&mdash;places or events included. If everyone smiles whenever we gather around freshly baked cookies, the cookies and the baker will <sem>also</sem> seem socially effective. We'll feel cookies can be agents of social cohesion.</p>

 <div class="box">   
            <p><headline>Comedic things.</headline> In the same way things can be <term>charming</term>, things can be <em>comedic</em> too. These might be things like funny sound effects <callback>(“sproooinng-ng-ng-ng!!”)</callback>, trampolines, oversized bouncy balls, penguins, farts and so on, which have an association with prioritizing intensity of humor, not fittedness.</p>
            
            <p>Comedic or charming people can react to our current evaluations and active topics, while static objects can't&mdash;which is why comedic or charming things are somewhat brittle in their emotional outcomes.</p>
            
            <p>In the same way a show may be <term>comedic</term> <callback>(making constant comedy attempts)</callback>, a festival may be <em>charming</em> <callback>(making constant charm attempts)</callback>. The organizers or producers adjust it to try to match the audience or attendees&mdash;and if successful, may be described as comedic or chraming.</p>
    </div>
            
    <!--    
         <p>We have a few ways of approaching these things. The first is by <term>intention</term> <callback>(someone intends humor by farting, whether or not anyone laughs)</callback>, where we focus on the humor <sem-weak>attempt</sem-weak>, and any humor that may or may not be generated. The second is by the emotion <em>generated</em>, without considering the intention <callback>(someone laughs at a fart, whether or not anyone intended laughter)</callback>.</p> 
    
        </div>
        
        <div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
        <p class="considertext">A person can adjust to our current evaluations and active topics, but a static object can't. A new metaphor printed on a sign may be charming at first&mdash;but with enough exposure, we'll find it cliche or stale instead. And the sign can't adjust like a person to callibrate to us.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">Other things may be a bit more flexible. Often, an event or festival is like a very big charm attempt&mdash;and the organizers adjust it each time to fit the  attendees, so that many people consistently find it charming.</p>
