    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charming</h1>   
    
<p><term>Last</term> chapter, we looked at <a href="../18chapter-charm/18-00-charm.html">charm</a>&mdash;judging or prioritizing the <sem>fittedness</sem> of humor or humor attempts. In <em>this</em> chapter, we'll look at being <vocab>charming</vocab>&mdash;many instances of charm.</p>

<p>We’ve known people in our lives who we would describe as charming. These might have been a:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>basketball coach who was indefatigable and made practice fun</li>
    <li>friend from college that we’d go exploring with</li>
    <li>grandparent that delighted us whenever we’d visit</li>
    <li>internet poster who improved an entire forum</li>
    <li>pastor who always said the right things</li>
    <li>pen pal who always remembered our birthday</li>
    <li>romantic partner who was generous and kind</li>
    <li>a local politician we liked despite ourselves</li>
    <li>train conductor who was the best of all train conductors</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>These charming people often had amazing abilities. They could:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>direct conversation</li>
    <li>fit in new places quickly</li>
    <li>gather people with ease</li>
    <li>make friends easily</li>
    <li>make people feel listened to</li>
    <li>make someone smile after something went wrong</li>
    <li>make their problems shrink</li>
    <li>project optimism</li>
    <li>tell people the things they needed to hear</li>
    <li>transmute problems into something else entirely</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

    <p>These abilities should look familiar—they’re humor outcomes by other names!</p>
    
<ul class="close-list">
   <li>direct conversation <humor-outcome>(open new topics of conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>fit in new places quickly <humor-outcome>(create rapport)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>gather people with ease <humor-outcome>(ease tension)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>make friends easily <humor-outcome>(mutually symbolize close ties)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>make people feel listened to <humor-outcome>(help them achieve catharthis)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>make someone smile after something went wrong <humor-outcome>(turn negative emotions into positive ones)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>make their problems shrink <humor-outcome>(survive stressful situations)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>project optimism <humor-outcome>(give new perspectives)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>tell people the things they needed to hear <humor-outcome>(acceptably criticize)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>transmute problems into something else entirely <humor-outcome>(handle complaints)</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>    

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
 <p>In other words, the people who come to mind as “charming” could frequently generate well-fitted humor and reach humor outcomes in a wide range of situations:</p>

<p>We'll be taking this broader look at fitted humor <callback>(being charming)</callback> throughout this chapter. </p>

<p>If we’re judging by intensity, then these humor attempts would be <term>bad</term> to okay instances of comedy. But if we instead judge by fittedness, these humor attempts are okay to <em>good</em> instances of charm.</p>


<div class="consider">
   
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">
    
    As we've seen, greater fittedness corresponds to greater efficiency and cohesion. This is why charming people seem socially effective and connective&mdash;they can generate fitted humor in a wide-range of situations!</p> 
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">People who are proficient at group efficiency and cohesion are charming for this reason. We describe them as charismatic and influential due to their skill at fitted humor&mdash;their skill at interpersonal effectiveness and cohesion.</p>
    </div>
 
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Things can be charming.</headline> We can find anything charming, not just people—like events, festivals, flowers, metaphors, packaging, places, sound effects, typography, user interfaces, walks, and so on. These things can have a charm-quality, since they tilt us toward humor outcomes and we often express humor tells toward them.</p>
    
    <p>Things are charming for the exact same reason jokes or people can be charming: they make us feel <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on; they help us <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>feel an argument has support</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">Since these things are static, they’re not <sem>always</sem> charming—since we don’t always feel humor from them. We may find a new metaphor (or typeface or place) charming at first, but with enough exposure find it cliche or tired instead.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>These <term>charming</term> things are in contrast with <em>comedic</em> things—like funny sound effects <callback>(“sproooinng-ng-ng-ng!!”)</callback>, trampolines, oversized bouncy balls, penguins, and so on, which have an association of being used to prioritize intensity of humor, not fittedness.</p>
