<p>We can think of humor family words as the <vocab>emotional orientation</vocab> of our lives. We emotionally orient toward <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 


<p>All things being equal, we emotionally orient ourselves around humor family words. Which means we orient toward the people, moments, memory, things, and so on that we find charming—that help us feel humor family words.</p>

Heather used to live beneath a couple who would frequently get into serious domestic arguments. It made her feel unsafe, and looks back on that time with a sick feeling.
