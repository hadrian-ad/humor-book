<p>We improve our charm attempts through small adjustments here and there&mdash;not by any sort of big, sweeping change to our approach.</p>


<p>Below, small changes make a big difference:</p>

<p>Sam improved his charm attempt by making small adjustments toward efficiency, cohesion, relevance, humor family words, humor outcomes, and so on&mdash;and didn't substantially change what he was saying, or imitate someone he wasn't like.</p> 
         
  <p>This is why becoming more charming isn’t an impossible matter of changing our personality <callback>("I must get from gruff to bubbly")</callback>&mdash;where one big change somehow makes us charming all at once.</p> 
    
<p>Instead, how charming we are or aren't just depends on our overall ability to observe emotional situations and then consistently make small adjustments accordingly.</p>
     
   
   
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">We may know someone who is both gregarious and charming. We may then link them: to be good at charm, we <sem>have</sem> to be gregarious—or at least <sem-weak>pretend</sem-weak> to be. But this often confuses a means <callback>(gregariousness)</callback> with the ends <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">It’s obvious that being gregarious isn’t the same thing as being charming—since we know gregarious people who <sem>aren’t</sem> charming, but annoying! The gregariousness is neither here nor there—what matters is whether or not they generate fitted humor.</p>
        
          <p class="considertext">We described charm as an outcome, not a method&mdash;with there being <sem>many</sem> paths to the same outcome. This is why we know people who are charming even while also being any combination of awkward, direct, brusque, careful, flamboyant, focused, forward, generous, gruff, impulsive, kind, loud, premeditative, quiet, sincere, shy, thoughtful, and so on.</p>
          
          <p class="considertext">What matters is reaching fitted humor&mdash;not so much how we get there. This is why consistent charm is ultimately about small nuance, and not macro elements of personality.</p>
    </div>
             

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Comparisons.</headline> If we have a charming friend, it can be exhausting to imagine trying to be charming like they are. But we <term>don't</term> have to try to be charming like they are&mdash;since there are <em>many</em> ways to be charming.</p>
    
    <p>When a thousand people become better at fitted humor, they’re not all converging toward the same style of being charming. Instead, they’d each be refining their own style in a way that feels very comfortable to each of them.</p>

    
    <p>We already know this feeling. When we’re in an unusually good mood, we’re better at generating fitted humor in ourselves or others. This experience usually feels less like becoming more like someone <term>else</term>, and more like <em>ourselves</em>&mdash;and feels good, not stressful.</p>
