<p>We improve our charm attempts through small adjustments here and there&mdash;not by any sort of big, sweeping change to our approach.</p>


<p>Below, small changes make a big difference:</p>

<p>Sam improved his charm attempt by making small adjustments toward efficiency, cohesion, relevance, humor family words, humor outcomes, and so on&mdash;and didn't substantially change what he was saying, or imitate someone he wasn't like.</p> 
         
  <p>This is why becoming more charming isn’t an impossible matter of changing our personality <callback>("I must get from gruff to bubbly")</callback>&mdash;where one big change somehow makes us charming all at once.</p> 
    
<p>Instead, how charming we are or aren't just depends on our overall ability to observe emotional situations and then consistently make small adjustments accordingly.</p>
     
   
   
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">We may know someone who is both gregarious and charming. We may then link them: to be good at charm, we <sem>have</sem> to be gregarious—or at least <sem-weak>pretend</sem-weak> to be. But this often confuses a means <callback>(gregariousness)</callback> with the ends <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">It’s obvious that being gregarious isn’t the same thing as being charming—since we know gregarious people who <sem>aren’t</sem> charming, but annoying! The gregariousness is neither here nor there—what matters is whether or not they generate fitted humor.</p>
        
          <p class="considertext">We described charm as an outcome, not a method&mdash;with there bing <sem>many</sem> paths to the same outcome. This is why we know people who are charming even while also being any combination of awkward, direct, brusque, careful, flamboyant, focused, forward, generous, gruff, impulsive, kind, loud, premeditative, quiet, sincere, shy, thoughtful, and so on.</p>
          
          <p class="considertext">What matters is reaching fitted humor&mdash;not so much how we get there. This is why consistent charm is ultimately about small nuance, and not macro elements of personality.</p>
    </div>
             


   <div class="box">
    
    <p><headline>Small things.</headline> We’re used to small adjustments having outsized importance all across our lives. A millimeter here and there isn’t trivial to screw sizes&mdash;a half inch isn't trivial to whether a 4x6 windowpane fits or not. That's because we all know that screws and window panes fit or don’t fit on this kind of precision.</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for our interactions with others. Sam’s comment will be fitted or not based on small things&mdash;like eye contact or a brief prelude that pins down relevancy for his audience. We improve our charm attempts through attention to these "interaction millimeters," not by dramatic changes.</p>
    
    <p>This can feel unbearably finicky at the beginning&mdash;but that's not unique to <term>humor</term>. <em>Every</em> skill is based on the importance of small things&mdash;whether baking, building, drumming, gaming, painting, and so on. But much of the initial feeling of finickiness goes away as we become more familiar with it.</p> 
    
    <p>Eventually, the importance of small things becomes something normal and even empowering&mdash;the skill revolves around mastery and exploration of these small things. This is as true in humor as in anything else.</p>
