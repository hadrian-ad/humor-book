    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charm emerges out of situational hooks</h1>   
      
<p>Another way we improve our charm is by improving our ability to notice <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-04-we-can-use-humor-family-words-as-hook-for-fitted-humor.html"> hooks</a> for fitted humor&mdash;since charm unfolds easily out of situational hooks.
</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If someone feels <emotions>nervous</emotions>, this is a hook to  try to make them feel <emotions>comfort</emotions> or <emotions>safety</emotions>&mdash;if someone mentions an achievement, this is a hook to try to help them feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>&mdash;and so on.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Similarly, if we mention someone's accomplishment, we're creating <sem-weak>our own</sem-weak> hook to make them feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>&mdash;or if we run into a moment where <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> is needed, we'd apologize.</p>
    
    </div>

<p>We can see Zoe do this when an old friend comes to visit her. Zoe will keep an eye out for hooks throughout the conversation. She’ll then try to press toward the most relevant humor family word. So Zoe might:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li><sem>welcome</sem> Sara when she arrives</li>
    <li><sem>appreciate</sem> that she’s come</li>
    <li>ask about what she’s done and react to it as an <sem>accomplishment</sem></li>
    <li>reframe what she learns from Sara as <sem>insight</sem> or <sem>realization</sem></li>
    <li>help her get <sem>comfortable</sem></li>
    <li>show <sem>acceptance</sem> or <sem>forgiveness</sem> to anything she brings up</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>When Zoe does this consistently and successfully, their interactions will be filled with humor, even if Zoe doesn’t use a single joke&mdash;and Sara will think of Zoe as charming:</p>

    <p class="considertext">Zoe’s goal is for Sara to <sem>feel</sem> <emotions>welcome</emotions>&mdash;not just feel that she’s “technically” welcome. This is where small adjustments come in to help Sara feel genuine welcome.</p>  
    
    <p class="considertext">Zoe will have to keep an eye out for humor tells, which will let her know if her welcomes are actually helping Sara feel <emotions>welcome</emotions>.</p>
