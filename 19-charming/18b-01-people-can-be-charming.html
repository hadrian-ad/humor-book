<p>We’ve known people in our lives who we would describe as charming:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>a basketball coach who was indefatigable and made practice fun</li>
    <li>a friend from college that we’d go exploring with</li>
    <li>a grandparent that delighted us whenever we’d visit</li>
    <li>an internet poster who improved an entire forum</li>
    <li>a pastor who always said the right things</li>
    <li>a pen pal who always remembered our birthday</li>
    <li>a romantic partner who was generous and kind</li>
    <li>a local politician we liked despite ourselves</li>
    <li>a train conductor who was the best of all train conductors</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>We often feel charming people have amazing social abilities. Often, we describe these abilities with humor outcomes, just by other names. These charming people could:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>direct conversation <humor-outcome>(open new topics of conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>fit in new places quickly <humor-outcome>(create rapport)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>gather people with ease <humor-outcome>(ease tension)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>make friends easily <humor-outcome>(mutually symbolize close ties)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>make people feel listened to <humor-outcome>(help them achieve catharsis)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>make someone smile after something went wrong <humor-outcome>(turn negative emotions into positive ones)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>make their problems shrink <humor-outcome>(survive stressful situations)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>project optimism <humor-outcome>(give new perspectives)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>tell people the things they needed to hear <humor-outcome>(acceptably criticize)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>transmute problems into something else entirely <humor-outcome>(handle complaints)</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>    

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
        

 <p>In other words, the people who come to mind as “charming” are charming <sem>because</sem> they could frequently generate well-fitted humor. They could reach humor outcomes in a wide range of situations.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We've previously talked about humor as the <a href="../14chapter-humor-outcomes/14-12-scales-of-description.html">mechanism of concordant influence</a>. People who are fluent with this mechanism are described as charming.</p>

<p>
   <headline>Dress codes.</headline> In our chapter on humor <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-03-humor-dress-codes-are-set-by-regular-patterns.html">dress codes</a>, we saw how more fittedness corresponded to more efficiency and cohesion. So successful moments of charm promote social efficiency and cohesion&mdash;which is why charming people seem socially effective and connective to us.</p> 
    
<p>
    We describe these charming people as charismatic or influential for this reason. We don't always think of charisma or influence as a humor skill, but it is! To see this, we can observe the <term>presence</term> of humor tells around charming people&mdash;or notice the <em>absence</em> of humor tells around uncharming people.</p>  
    
<p>If someone can <term>frequently</term> generate fitted humor in <em>many</em> kinds situations, they'll constantly seem socially effective&mdash;and as an agent of social cohesion, we'll describe them as charming.</p>
