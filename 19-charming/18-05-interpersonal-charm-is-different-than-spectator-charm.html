    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">There are degrees of charming</h1> 
    
<p>In our day-to-day conversations, we often have a specific and narrow use of the word "charm"&mdash;something often connected to flirting or seducing.</p> 
         
<p>But that's not how we're using charm here. Our word "charm" is just a way of looking at humor. This is why we can meet two cats:  a “charming” cat and an “uncharming” cat.</p>

   <ul class="close-list">
    <li>The <term>charming</term> cat would quickly <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>change our negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li> 
    
<li>The <em>uncharming</em> cat would <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>resist</outcome-contrast> becoming accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>raise</outcome-contrast> tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>change positive emotions into <outcome-contrast>negative</outcome-contrast> ones</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>The cats would be charming or not depending on the ease and frequency that they reach humor outcomes. This doesn’t have anything to do with the cats being flirtatious and seductive!</p>

<p>We can make this comparison between anything. We can imagine:</p>

   <ul class="close-list">
    <li>two parents, one “more charming” and the other “less charming”</li>
    <li>two middle school basketball coaches, one “more charming” and the other "less charming”</li>
    <li>two guest speakers, one “more charming” and the other “less charming”</li>
    <li>two houses, one “more charming” and the other “less charming”</li>
    <li>two walks, one “more charming” and the other “less charming”</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Judged over time, one of each pair can more easily reach humor outcomes make people feel humor family words than the other.</p> 
 
<p>Since people are charming by degrees, we can intuitively compare people or things by how "charming" they are.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
     
     <p class="considertext">Our perceptions of charm are subjective. <term>We</term> may find a baseball game charming, but our <em>friend</em> may not. Someone isn't <callback>"charming"</callback> but <callback>"charming (to different degrees to different people)"</callback>
