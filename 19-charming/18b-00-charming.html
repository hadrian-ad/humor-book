<p>Last chapter, we looked at <a href="../18chapter-charm/18-00-charm.html">charm</a>&mdash;judging or prioritizing humor or humor attempts by fittedness, not intensity.</p> 

<p>In this chapter, we'll look at being <vocab>charming</vocab>&mdash;which is <sem>many</sem> instances of charm.</p>

    <p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <speech>“Minh, I’ve seen it!  You want my genuine opinion? It’s a totally wonderful piece of art.”</speech></p>

<p>Since Amaya <sem>regularly</sem> generates fitted humor in Minh and others, Minh finds her to be charming.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">If we’re judging by intensity, then Amaya's humor attempts would be <term>bad</term> to okay instances of comedy. But if we're judging by fittedness, these humor attempts are okay to <em>good</em> instances of charm.</p>
</div>

<p>We'll be taking this broader look at fitted humor <callback>(being charming)</callback> throughout this chapter.</p>


<div class="box">
    
    <p><headline>Description.</headline> Last chapter, we looked at how we can feel fitted humor on a walk. We'd describe our humor tells as <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on:</p> 
    
    <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-03-we-often-feel-low-intensity-humor-but-do-not-notice-that-we-do/18-03-0-gloomy-walk.jpg

    alt="This photo is of the autumn road, curving enticingly, sky overcast with orange leaves blanketing the ground and wet pine trunks";
    title="Photo of a walk";
    style="max-width: 17rem; margin-left: 3rem; ">

   <p>But we wouldn't feel all these things briefly once and then never again the rest of the walk. Instead, we'd probably feel fitted humor continuously at various things over a few hours&mdash;we'd continually experience or notice new things <callback>(mistakes)</callback> and feel fine about them <callback>(OK)</callback>.  
   </p>
   
   <p>In that sense, we can say it's a charming walk&mdash;there's continuous or frequent instances of charm. Minh feels something similar about Amaya, for similar reasons&mdash;he finds her charming, due to continous or frequent instances of fitted humor.</p>
