    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We have a preference for charm over comedy</h1>   
    
   
<p>We have a long-term preference for charm. Comedy tends to be only transiently important to us.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We saw this in miniature when Brad attended Zoe's student art gallery. Years later, Zoe probably wouldn't remember any puns that Brad made there <callback>(“got your oil shop up and running!”)</callback>—but she probably <sem-weak>would</sem-weak> remember him helping her feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions> and <emotions>achievement</emotions> <callback>(“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”)</callback>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The pun made a transient impression, but the affirmation&mdash;specifically the humor family words it led to&mdash;formed a durable impression.</p>
</div>

<p>This long-term preference for charm and "charmingness" is true for both our interpersonal lives and in spectator entertainment. </p>



<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We have a long-term preference for <outcome-contrast>interpersonal</outcome-contrast> charm.</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we think about the people felt the most connection with throughout our life, it’s usually the people who have made us feel the most <sem>fitted</sem> humor. Similarly, it's usually people we found charming that we wished we had gotten to know more.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>By contrast, if we think back to the various social eras of our lives and try to remember the funny one of the group, we may realize we haven’t thought of them in a while:</p>
    
    
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Hey. Remember Josh B.?”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*puts down fork*</action> <action>*puts head in hand*</action> <speech>“Oh my god. Josh B.! I haven’t thought of him in ages.”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Do you think he really drank that bottle of pee, or was he just joking?”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“I have no idea. I just remember him singing hundred bottles of beer in AP Lit. Mrs. Gardiner was <sem-weak>pissed</sem-weak>.”</speech> </p>
    </div>
    
     
    
    <p>At the time, Zoe and Emma may have giggled at Josh B. along with everyone else—but when they remember him years later, they forget the intensity and mainly remember the unfittedness.</p>
    
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">Josh B. single-mindedly focused on intensity of humor, without any concern for fittedness. He made funny remarks at the serious parts of movies; undercut sincere moments with meta-commentary; only wanted to watch outrageous comedies; chased pranks for pranks' sake, and so on.</p> 
           
           <p class="considertext">He fixated on using intensity as a measure of good humor, which was at odds with how people around him actually determine good humor.</p>
            
    </div>
     
    
    <p>Josh may have noticed that even though people laughed, he didn't really form lasting connection with them. That's because it's <sem-weak>fittedness</sem-weak> that leads to connection and cohesion—and Josh doesn't sometimes priotize fittedness, he won't be driving any connection and cohesion.</p> 
    
    <p>This is why class clowns often only feel tenuously integrated with the people they make laugh&mdash;and tend to be excluded easily or forgotten quickly.</p>
         
    
    <p>By contrast, memories of <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on tend to persist, since we recall those experiences easily. Years later, Emma and Zoe probably fondly remember moments of kind smiles or unsolicited moments of help.</p>
    
    
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>When Zoe was a freshmen, she dropped her notebook and someone swooped down and picked it up, handing it to her with a smile. Zoe smiles back.</narration></p>

    </div>
    
    <p>Sandra’s charm attempts weren’t as flashy as Josh B.’s humor attempts&mdash;but Josh B.’s comedy attempts faded in importance over time, while Sandra’s charm attempts persisted as positive.</p> 
    
    <p>Since humor family words and humor outcomes persist in our memories, in a way that the intensity of humor usually doesn't, we have a long-term preference for charm.</p>
</div>



<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We have a long-term preference for <outcome-contrast>spectator</outcome-contrast> charm.</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we think back to our favorite entertainment over the years, the things that come to mind are usually things with lots of charm to them. It wasn’t that they <term>weren’t</term> ever comedic—it was instead that they could at least <em>occasionally</em> stop prioritizing intensity and take time to prioritize fittedness instead.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>Because this entertainment gave us feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, and so on and helped us reach humor outcomes, we say it struck a chord with us.</p> 
    
    <p>For instance, we might have fond memory of media about:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>sponges and squids that deal with work and boredom in different ways</li>
        <li>office workers who are dysfunctional but endearing</li> 
        
        <li>families in a small town with a nuclear power plant</li>
        <li>doctors during a war</li>
        <li>a space crew of mercenaries and passengers</li>
        <li>washed up and depressed animals past the peak of their careers</li>
        <li>friends travelling between elemental nations</li>
        <li>a sad cop who lost his memory and talks to himself a lot</li>
        <li>puppets and people that live on the same block</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>
    
    
    
    <p>It was the charm mixed into the comedy that kept these things meaningful to us over longer periods of time&mdash;for the same reason it's the charm that makes us remember friends or strangers years later.</p> 
    
    <p>By contrast, the things that were primarily comedic might take more effort to remember. We might have watched a show about talking cat butts years ago, and felt like we were about to die of laughter—but as we change, or the cultural milieu changes, we might forget about it, and our memory of it isn’t straightforwardly positive.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">Between two equally intense moments of humor, we’ll usually have a preference for the one with greater fittedness. That’s because—all things being equal—we’d rather feel intense humor we'd describe as <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on than intense humor we wouldn't.</p>

    <p>This long-term preference for things we find or found charming isn’t surprising. We saw last chapter how fittedness was involved with group efficiency and cohesion. That means <term>charm</term> often marks constructive moments in our lives&mdash;and things that were <em>charming</em> were so consistently constructive that they mark almost architectural aspects of our lives. </p>

<p>In part, that's because humor family words are the <vocab>emotional orientation</vocab> of our lives. We emotionally orient toward <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 


<p>All things being equal, we try to emotionally orient ourselves around or in pursuit of humor family words&mdash;which means we orient toward the people, moments, memory, things, and so on that we find charming.</p>

    A deeper look (Spectator charm)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">
    
    <p>Sometimes, the word “charm” makes us think about <vocab>spectator charm</vocab>—which makes us think of a certain kind of affectation, background, confidence, flirtatiousness, glamour, grooming, wit, and so on.</p>

<p>In our chapter on <a href="../10chapter-spectator-entertainment/10-0-spectator-entertainment.html">spectator entertainment</a>, we saw how things like insults or getting run over by busses can make <term>characters</term> feel bad, even as it makes <em>spectators</em> feel humor. In <term>movies</term>, insults generate humor&mdash;but that doesn't straightforwardly mean they generate humor the same way in <em>real life</em>.</p>  
        
    <p>The same thing is true of charming spectator characters. In the audience, we may smile at characters with ambiguous or impossible personal backgrounds; dark, antiheroic aesthetics; cold-blooded instincts; stainless (or stained) honor; utter confidence; perfect beauty; wealth; or so on.</p>
    
    <p>But in the same way we can smile at a character getting hit by a bus without that meaning the same thing would make us smile in real life, we can smile at a charming spectator character <callback>("utter confidence")</callback> without thinking that same thing would make us smile in real life.</p> 
       
    <p>This is why we don't straightforwardly aspire to mimicking spectator entertainment in our day-to-day lives:</p>

       <div class="vignette">    
        <p>
            <narration>Zoe watches <book-title>Gone with the Wind</book-title>. </narration>
        </p>
          
        <p>
            <narration>Scarett is upset after a rejection, and Rhett emerges to mock her. He's dashing and absolutely charming. Scarlett ends the scene in tears.</narration>
        </p>  
          
        <p>
            <narration>Zoe smiles at Rhett's easy confidence.</narration>
        </p>
        </div>
            
        <p>When Rhett talks to Scarlett, the <term>audience</term> feels he's charming&mdash;but the <em>character</em> (Scarlett) feels he's repulsive and infuriating. So we wouldn't want to be exactly like Rhett in real life and be seen as repulsive and infuriating.</p> 
        
          <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-05-interpersonal-charm-is-different-than-spectator-charm/18-05-0-rhett-spectator.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 25rem; margin-left: 1rem">
        
    <p>This happens because <term>we</term> feel Rhett <humor-outcome>controls the situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handles criticisms</humor-outcome>, and so on&mdash;but <em>Scarlett</em> doesn't feel this. We take this split in stride because it's spectator entertainment.</p>
    
    <p>So while Rhett may be an example of how <term>characters</term> can be seen as charming&mdash;he's not a great example of how <em>we</em> can be seen as charming.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">We may notice that stage make-up works really well on actors when we watch a play. But that doesn't mean we should think we should wear stage make-up to a work meeting!</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      When we're sitting on a sofa at home watching our favorite actor on TV, we have a large OK&mdash;we feel very secure from negative consequences. This large OK means that movies can play around with large mistakes&mdash;like with rogues or anti-heroes who brashly bend or break the rules.</p> 
         
     <p>These characters generate large mistakes to balance with these large OKs, making audiences feel humor. This humor is why an audience considers the impossibly competent and socially-free Rhett Butler as charming&mdash;the audience see him as <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizing</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>sharing personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport (with the readers or other characters)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling (Scarlett or other people's) complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>able support his arguments</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>
    It takes a roguish character to do this in spectator entertainment. But of course, in our own lives, where the OKs are not so huge and the active topics not so simple, it usually just takes an achievable bit of awareness to generate fitted humor&mdash;not being impossible competent.<p> 
    
      <p>This is why we know a broad variety of charming people in our lives&mdash;none of whom are like movie characters in one-on-one conversations.</p>
    
    
  <!--  
         <p class="considertext">Surreal attributes and actions work well in spectator templates, but don't straightforwardly transplant to interpersonal templates.</p> 
                
        <p class="considertext">This is similar to how heavy stage makeup works well under bright lights from a distance. But just because it looks good to audiences for a staged production doesn't mean it would look good if we wore it to work.</p> -->
     
    <p>It would be weird to think we were supposed to be like characters who:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>spontaneously dance 
            have swordfights </li>
        <li>defeated illness with only the strength of vengeance</li>
        <li>held long witty conversations</li> </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>In the same vein, it would <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> be weird to think we were supposed to imitate characters who were scripted to be charming for spectators in spectator templates.</p>
     
     <p>Instead, we can look around and see who we actually find charming, who may be teachers, coaches, cashiers, friends, uncles, and so on&mdash;who aren't movie characters but help us reach humor outcomes easily anyway.</p>

           <p>And broading our idea of the word "charm," we can see how walks or welcoming old friends is part of a charming life as well&mdash;something all wrapped up in the ability to think about the fittedness of humor.</p>

    <div class="content">

<p>When we feel fitted humor repeatedly around someone or something, we think of them as charming.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
        People who are charming have social influence&mdash;they're successful at using concordant mechanisms of influence. We experience this as appeal, appreciation, comraderie, enjoyment, friendship, love, and so on.</li>
    
    
    <li>Charmingness is something experienced by degree, which is why we can sort comparative things by how charming they are. For instance, the more charming cat reaches more humor outcomes more often than the less charming cat.
    </li>
    
    <li>We <a href="18-13-we-have-a-preference-for-charm-over-comedy.html">emotionally orient </a> toward fitted humor. For instance, we'll be drawn toward things that make us feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and other humor family words.
