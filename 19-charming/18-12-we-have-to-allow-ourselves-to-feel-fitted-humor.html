    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We have to allow ourselves to feel fitted humor as well</h1>   
    
 
<p>To be charming, it’s not enough to make <term>others</term> feel fitted humor—we have to allow <em>ourselves</em> to feel fitted humor as well.</p>

<p>Zoe’s goal isn’t to make Sara feel humor while herself emotionally guarding against humor&mdash;instead, Zoe has to <sem>also</sem> express humor when Sara tries to be charming in return.</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sara sets her backpack down and admires Zoe’s plants.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <speech>“You’ve always done such a good job with your plants. I can barely keep that succulent you gave me alive, let alone look after twenty pots!”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe allows herself to feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe accepts charm&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <internalaction>(deflecting)</internalaction> <speech>“Well. Thanks! It’s not that big a deal after a while, they’re just plants.”</speech></p>
    
     <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*embarrassed*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> allow herself to feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe <outcome-contrast>declines</outcome-contrast> charm&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes> <internalaction>(deflecting)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh, it’s not a big deal, they’re just plants.”</speech></p>
    
</div>


<p>Over time, <sem>mutual</sem> fitted humor allows for <sem>mutual</sem> feelings of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on—which accomplishes Zoe’s goal of mutually renewing their friendship.</p>

<p>This is why Zoe defaults giveing greater priority to <term>fittedness</term> than <em>intensity</em>. Fittedness is more in-line than her long-term objectives than intensity is by itself.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Default.</headline> Sometimes we default to comedy attempts, like if we've fallen into class clown roles, or develop a habit of undercutting moments of <emotions>connection</emotions> or <emotions>delight</emotions>. When we default this way, we sometimes run into awkward moments or hurt others, and don't develop close connections with others. </p>
    
     
      <p>That's why we default to charm attempts, since fitted humor is what allows us to have functioning and enjoyable experiences with each other. It allows us to mutually feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>And by defaulting to charm, we improve our comedy attempts too&mdash;since defaulting to charm give ourselves the space to pick and choose when we make comedy attempts. This gives us the best of both worlds: the ability to consistently make fitted humor attempts, interspersed with moments of high-intensity humor. </p>
