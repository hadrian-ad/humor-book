    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charm emerges out of situational hooks</h1>   
      
 <p>Charm unfolds easily out of <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-04-we-can-use-humor-family-words-as-hook-for-fitted-humor.html">situational hooks</a>. If someone feels <emotions>nervous</emotions>, we can try to make them feel <emotions>comfort</emotions> or <emotions>safety</emotions>—if someone mentions an achievement, we help them feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>—and so on. This can guide our charm.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We saw hooks used this way when Sam gave his long speech to the drama team. When Sam talked about an <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, he wanted them to feel an <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>; when he’d noticed a moment where reconciliation would be appropriate, he’d apologize.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">These hooks cued him where and how to generate fitted humor, which led to one version of his speech being more charming than the other.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>We can see Zoe do this when an old friend comes to visit her. Zoe will keep an eye out for hooks throughout the conversation. She’ll then try to press toward the most relevant humor family word. So Zoe might:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li><sem>welcome</sem> Sara when she arrives</li>
    <li><sem>appreciate</sem> that she’s come</li>
    <li>ask about what she’s done and react to it as an <sem>accomplishment</sem></li>
    <li>reframe what she learns from Sara as <sem>insight</sem> or <sem>realization</sem></li>
    <li>help her get <sem>comfortable</sem></li>
    <li>show <sem>acceptance</sem> or <sem>forgiveness</sem> to anything she brings up</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>When Zoe is consistently charming, their interactions will be filled with humor—even if Zoe doesn’t use a single joke:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">

    <p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <narration>“Oh yeah!”</narration></p>
</div>

<p>Zoe’s goal is for Sara to experience <emotions>welcome</emotions>—not just feel that she’s “technically” welcome. That means Zoe has to keep an eye out for humor tells. The humor tells will let Zoe know if her welcomes are helping Sara feel <emotions>welcome</emotions>.</p>
