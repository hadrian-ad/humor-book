    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Focusing on humor outcomes can generate humor where jokes can't</h1>
    

<p>When we want to generate humor in complex situations, we often have no option but to use high-velocity comments.</p>

<p>That's because in complicated or static emotional situations, low-velocity comments can become mired and make no headway toward humor tripwires. It's only high-velocity actions or comments that can break through to reach humor outcomes:</p>

</div>

<p>The jokes above were low-velocity&mdash;they had an outcome in mind, but didn't take the most direct route there. They were easily deflected from humor outcome tripwires.</p>
  
<p>By contrast, the higher-velocity alternatives were more successful at reaching humor outcome tripwires in these specific circumstances.</p>

  <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">High-velocity comments are good at generating <sem>all kinds</sem> of emotions. Even though in our examples the high-velocity comments lead to <term>humor</term>, we can easily imagine alternatives where the high velocity comments led to <em>mistake-predominant emotions</em> instead—where Justin was <outcome-contrast>annoyed</outcome-contrast> by Emma, Alina was <outcome-contrast>dismissive</outcome-contrast> of Hana, Zoe was <outcome-contrast>embarrassed</outcome-contrast> by Brad, and Amber was <outcome-contrast>angry</outcome-contrast> at Jennifer.</p>

    </div>

<p>The point here isn’t that rushing humor outcomes is a magic method to generating humor—because it’s not! Generating humor in this way requires favorable conditions, judgment, luck, practice, skill, and so on&mdash;in addition to the stakes often being higher.</p>

<p>Instead, the point is just to understand why and how humor does or doesn't happens&mdash;even in some initially confusing situations.</p>

<p>Sometimes these observations go against how we think interactions are supposed to work. This can make them seem confusing or mysterious. But once we know how to think about it, the humor in these situations isn’t confusing or mysterious.</p>

<p>The people in these examples are just using outcome-first methods of generating humor. They’re rushing humor outcome tripwires like <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, or so on—and the high velocity rushes the comments across tripwires before anyone can deflect them.</p> 

<p>This isn't random, unknowable, or at all outside any normal pattern of humor—it's just humor like it always is. It's not breaking any laws of social physics.</p>

<p>Still, at first these these sharp, outcome-first humor attempts might seem like gambles—like someone is rolling the dice on whether someone feels anger or humor from these comments. But there’s actually very little gambling in the examples above&mdash;since everyone had high confidence that the person they were talking to would laugh and not be offended.</p> 

<p>We already know what this feels like, like when we <sem>know</sem> whether or not someone will feel humor before we make a comment:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*putting on tie*</action> <action>*walking into bedroom*</action> <speech>“And how are you today, my little crab cake?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam knows Jennifer will laugh at this)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“That’s the worst one yet!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    </div>
    
<p>When Sam uses a joke nickname with Jennifer, he isn't sweating and crossing his fingers. <callback>("Oh god oh god I hope this lands")</callback> He already knows Jennifer will laugh!</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">If he thought she’d be annoyed, he wouldn’t have said it—and even if she’s unexpectedly out of sorts, he’s not worried about his ability to adapt to it.</p>
</div> 

<p>This feeling of future confidence is the same feeling everyone in our examples had when they made their sharp comments. Each person had practiced a similar kind of comment with many different kinds of people in similar situations over and over:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Elias often flirts with strangers</li>
    <li>Amber often comments on physical appearances of strangers</li>
    <li>Emma is often direct with people</li>
    <li>the waiter deals with dozens of customers each day</li>
    <li>Timothy delivers bad news to patients all the time</li>
    <li>the tutor works with many students each day</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>This constant practice gave them the skill to have a pretty good idea of the emotional outcome in advance. In the same way Sam and Jennifer's constant interaction lets them have high confidence in outcomes, the tutor's constant interaction with clients lets them have high confidence in outcomes.</p>

<p>These comments only <term>appear</term> to be acts of courageous spontaneity <em>if</em> we see them as an isolated, single instance—instead of part of a practiced skill.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we watched a baseball game and thought all the college athletes were playing for the first time, it would seem like an astonishing, out-of-the-blue miracle to watch them catch a fly ball.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">But instead, when we watch college baseball we know the players have spent a decade practicing those specific skills. We're still impressed by their dedication and upper-end perfomance. But we don't think that their ability to do so arrived mysteriously from nowhere that very moment.</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">It's the same thing for humor. It's not an astonishing miracle when Amber makes the server laugh. <callback>("You look terrible.")</callback> It only looks that way if we think the ability to do so arrived mysteriously from nowhere that very moment&mdash;when instead, it's something she's spent years or even decades practicing.</p>
</div>

<p>How does the tutor knows in advance which student will respond in which way?</p>

<p>Partially, the tutor judges how disposed a client seems to defend certain tripwires. This lets the tutor decide which topics to try to generate humor on, and how. With enough clients and practice, the tutor develops an intuitive skill at this.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If a student is arrogant, controlling, demanding, defensive, proud, and so on, they may resist being rushed across <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome> tripwire. In this case, the tutor may focus first on <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">But if a student seems to be looking for advice, is nervous, unsure of what to do, uncertain of the quality of their work, willing to put in more work, and so on—then the tutor may judge that they can rush them across <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome> tripwires, and in a way the student will appreciate and find productive and positive.</p> </div>

<p>It’s the same for the other examples. Elias, Emma, Amber, Timothy, and the waiter knew in advance how the specific people they were talking too would react. They knew what the likely outcome would be, and were confident they could handle outlier outcomes.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes this outcome-first humor confuses us because of its apparent negativity, like when Amber criticized someone. <callback>(“You look terrible.”)</callback> But our confusion is caused by an incorrect assumption: that we only feel humor at “good” things, and that we shouldn't feel humor at “bad” things.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">But as we’ve seen, humor doesn’t distinguish straightforwardly between “good” and “bad.” All that matters is how much something deviates from our expectations, and whether that’s matched by our sense of security from negative personal consequences.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">If the server feels secure from negative personal consequences, we don’t need to think about ideas like “good” or “bad.” Questions like <callback>“was it good or bad for Amber to make that comment?”</callback> or <callback>"is it good or bad to be told we look terrible?"</callback> aren't relevant to thinking about why someone does or doesn't feel humor.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>We can probably find places in our own lives where others would view our own humor skills as miraculous—we just don’t notice this because these skills seem so utterly normal to us, like how we interact with:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>new coworkers</li>
    <li>freshmen teammates</li>
    <li>young children</li>
    <li>patients</li>
    <li>long-standing clients</li>
    <li>online friends</li>
    <li>social media comments</li>
    <li>vendors</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">and so on</p> 

<p>Through experience, exposure, feedback, opportunity, practice, and so on, we’ve picked up an ability to gauge outcomes around these people. This lets us act in ways that can seem miraculous to others—especially if someone confuses our years of familiarity and practice for some kind of exceptional, one-off ability.</p> 

<p>By themselves, these sharper skills with humor are neither good nor bad. Sometimes they’re used for negative manipulation. Other times, we start relying on them, and we fall into a rut that prevents us from practicing other ways of relating to others. And sometimes we overextend ourselves—or trick ourselves into thinking we’re better at a sharp social skill than we really are.</p> 

<p>But what <sem>is</sem> good is understanding how all this happens. It can help us deal with the humor we feel unexpectedly from high-velocity experiences, including when it’s part of negative manipulation—as well as reducing how often humor strikes us as confusing or mysterious.</p>

<p>We can expand our spatial metaphor of humor ("tripwires") by thinking of actions in an evaluatory situation as vectors.</p>
