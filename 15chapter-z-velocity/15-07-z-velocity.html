<p>It can be hard to defend a tripwire when the situational ball has high velocity. The situation can reach the tripwire so suddenly that we find ourselves almost compelled to laugh&mdash;or laugh almost without even realizing it:</p>

           <headline>Velocity.</headline> We're already familiar with velocity in things like requests. If someone wants to borrow our car, they may be indirect <callback>("I have to go home next weekend, and I haven't figured out how I'll get there yet")</callback> or direct <callback>("can I borrow your car for the weekend?")</callback>

        It's the same for pushing someone toward humor outcomes.
