<p>It's hard to guard tripwires against high-velocity movement:</p>

<p>When Zoe actually <sem-weak>does</sem-weak> a handstand, she irresistably <humor-outcome>supports her argument (that she can do a handstand</humor-outcome>. The lack of room to question or dispute this means Emma can't prevent the situation from reaching the <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome> tripwire.</p>  

<p>We increase velocity toward humor outcomes by minimizing interpretive ambiguity or slack&mdash;we <vocab>rush</vocab> a tripwire:</p>
