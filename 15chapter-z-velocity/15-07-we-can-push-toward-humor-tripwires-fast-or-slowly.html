<p>We can expand our <a href="../15chapter-tripwires/15-00-tripwires-a.html#exclude-navigation">spatial metaphor</a> of humor by thinking about the situational ball as having <vocab>velocity</vocab>.</p>

<p>The <term>harder</term> we press toward humor outcomes, the <term>more</term> velocity on the ball. The <em>lighter</em> we press, the <em>less</em> velocity:</p>

<p>Above, when someone was <term>direct</term> about reaching a humor outcome, they <term>increased</term> the velocity. When they were <em>indirect</em>, they <em>decreased</em> the velocity.</p>
   
    
<p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.</p>
    
    <div class="box"><p><headline>Actions.</headline> We often think of humor as involving <term>speech</term>, but it more often than not involves <em>actions</em>. We can <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome> with our friend or partner through actions more concretely than by just words alone.</p> 
        
        <p>When Zoe takes the initiative to massage Emma or Sam happily puts on his coat to run an errand with Jennifer, these actions directly embody or lead to humor outcomes. The speech was neither here nor there.</p>
        
         <p>In terms of our spatial metaphor, it's actions or consequential words that put velocity on the situational ball toward emotional outcomes&mdash;which is why Zoe and Sam just saying things can be treated as more inconsequential.</p> </div>
