    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Pushing someone to a humor outcome is a humor attempt</h1>


<p>When we're attempting to lead someone across humor tripwires, we're making a <vocab>humor attempt</vocab>.</p>
  
    
 <p>In this book, a humor attempt is very broad. A joke can exist inertly in a book. The humor attempt would be <sem>using</sem> that joke, inclusive of the content, delivery, intention, situation, and so on. In this case, the joke would just be a part of the humor attempt:</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >
    
    <p>So if a hundred people tell the same joke, they're using <term>one</term> joke but making a <em>hundred</em> different humor attempts&mdash;since each person would be:</p> 
    
<ul class="close-list">
        <li>talking to a different person </li>
        <li>using a different inflection</li>
        <li>have a different relation to the joke</li>
        <li>speaking at different times of day</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
   
<p><sem-weak>Anything</sem-weak> that intends someone to feel humor is a humor attempt. So bringing our parents <sem>tea</sem> is a humor attempt—so long as we want them to <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell> and <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome> and experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p>  

<p>When Sam puts on his jacket to go with Jennifer or Zoe massages Emma's shoulders, they're intending someone to express humor tells&mdash;so it's a humor attempt. If it results in humor tells, it's a <sem-weak>successful</sem-weak> humor attempt. </p>
    

    
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
        
        <p class="considertext">Humor attempts have qualities like velocity, intended topics, participants, and so on.

    <p>Throughout this book, we'll use "humor attempts" to talk about the broad range of things that intend someone to feel humor.</p>
    
    
    
    <!--
    <p>As before, a humor attempt may or may not actually generate any humor. We may bring our parents tea, hoping to make them smile—but they may ignore us, or cry or shout in anger. In this case, it's still a humor attempt <callback>(we wanted them to experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, and so on)</callback>—just a humor attempt that didn't generate humor.</p>
    -->

<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Relation.</headline> We can use "humor attempts" to clearly describe how things relate to an emotional situation.</p> 
       
       <p>We sometimes use unclear words like "joke" or "insult" to describe a comment or action, but these words can be ambiguous because not all jokes intend humor, just like not all insults intend pain.</p> 
       
        <p>By describing intention first <callback>("humor attempt")</callback>, we won't need to use words like joke or insult&mdash;and if we do, it'll be clear the intention is to produce humor tells and reach humor outcomes.</p> 
        
        <p>More importantly, the phrase "humor attempt" gives us a way to talk collectively about everything we do to generate smiles or laughs, including the ones we don't have names for&mdash;like bringing our parents tea, massaging someone's shoulders, giving a sincere compliment, and so on.</p>

<p>Sometimes these observations go against how we think interactions are supposed to work. This can make them seem confusing or mysterious. But once we know how to think about it, the humor in these situations isn’t confusing or mysterious.</p>

<p>The people in these examples are just making high-velocity humor attempts! They're taking an <a href="../15chapter-tripwires/15-06-it-often-takes-many-steps-before-we-feel-humor.html">outcome-first</a> approach of rushing humor outcome tripwires&mdash;like <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, or so on. The high velocity rushes someone across humor tripwires before those tripwires can be guarded.</p> 

<p>This humor isn't breaking any laws of social physics. It isn't random, unknowable, or at all outside any normal pattern of humor—it's just humor like it always is.</p>

<p>Still, at first these these sharp, outcome-first humor attempts might seem like gambles—like someone is rolling the dice on whether someone feels anger or humor from these comments. But since everyone had high confidence that the person they were talking to would laugh and not be offended, there’s actually very little uncalculated gambling.</p> 

<p>We already know what it feels like to <sem>know</sem> whether or not someone will feel humor before we make a comment:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*putting on tie*</action> <action>*walking into bedroom*</action> <speech>“And how are you today, my little crab cake?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam knows Jennifer will laugh at this)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“That’s the worst one yet!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    </div>
    
<p>When Sam uses a joke nickname with Jennifer, he isn't sweating and crossing his fingers. <callback>("Oh god oh god I hope this lands")</callback> He already knows Jennifer will laugh!</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">If he thought she’d be annoyed, he wouldn’t have said it. He knows it's possible she’s unexpectedly out of sorts, but also feels confident he could adapt to this outcome.</p>
</div> 

<p>This feeling of confidence in the future is the same feeling everyone in our examples had when they made their sharp comments. Each person had lots of practice with different people in similar situations:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Elias often flirts with strangers</li>
    <li>Amber often comments on physical appearances of strangers</li>
    <li>Emma is often direct with people</li>
    <li>the waiter deals with dozens of customers each day</li>
    <li>Timothy delivers bad news to patients all the time</li>
    <li>the tutor works with many students each day</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>This constant practice gave them a sense of the emotional outcome in advance. In the same way Sam and Jennifer's constant interaction lets them have high confidence in outcomes of what they say, the tutor's constant interaction with clients lets them have high confidence in outcomes.</p>

<p>These comments only <term>appear</term> to be acts of courageous spontaneity <em>if</em> we see them as an isolated, single instance—instead of part of a practiced skill.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we watched a baseball game and thought all the college athletes were playing for the first time, it would seem like an astonishing, out-of-the-blue miracle to watch them catch a fly ball.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">But that's not how we watch college baseball. Instead, we know the players have spent a decade practicing those specific skills. We're still impressed by their dedication and upper-end perfomance&mdash;but don't think tthe skill to do so arrived mysteriously from nowhere that very moment.</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">It's the same thing for humor. It's not an astonishing miracle when Amber makes the server laugh. <callback>("You look terrible.")</callback> It only looks that way if we think the ability to do so arrived mysteriously from nowhere that very moment&mdash;when instead, like a baseball player, it's something she's spent years or even decades practicing.</p>
</div>

<p>How does the tutor know in advance which student will respond in which way?</p>

<p>Partially, the tutor judges how disposed a client seems to defend certain tripwires on certain topics. With enough clients and practice, the tutor develops an intuitive skill at this.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If a client is arrogant, controlling, demanding, defensive, proud, and so on, they may resist being rushed across <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome> tripwire. In this case, the tutor may focus first on <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">But if a student seems to be looking for advice, is nervous, unsure of what to do, uncertain of the quality of their work, open to suggestions, and so on—then the tutor may judge that they can rush them across <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome> tripwires, in a way the student will appreciate and find productive and positive.</p> </div>

<p>It’s the same for the other examples. Elias, Emma, Amber, Timothy, and the waiter knew in advance how the specific people they were talking too would react. They knew what the likely outcome would be, and were confident they could handle outlier outcomes.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes this outcome-first humor confuses us because of its apparent negativity, like when Amber criticized someone. <callback>(“You look terrible.”)</callback> But our confusion is caused by an incorrect assumption: that we only feel humor at “good” things, and that we shouldn't feel humor at “bad” things.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">But as we’ve seen, humor doesn’t distinguish straightforwardly between “good” and “bad.” All that matters is how much something deviates from our expectations, and whether that’s matched by our sense of security from negative personal consequences.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">If the server feels secure from negative personal consequences, we don’t need to think about ideas like “good” or “bad.” Questions like <callback>“was it good or bad for Amber to make that comment?”</callback> or <callback>"is it good or bad to be told we look terrible?"</callback> aren't relevant to thinking about why someone does or doesn't feel humor.</p>    
    
    </div>
    
<p>We can probably find places in our own lives where others would view our own humor skills as miraculous—we just don’t notice this because these skills seem so utterly normal to us. These might be how we interact with:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>new coworkers</li>
    <li>freshmen teammates</li>
    <li>young children</li>
    <li>patients</li>
    <li>long-standing clients</li>
    <li>online friends</li>
    <li>social media comments</li>
    <li>vendors</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>We’ve picked up an ability to gauge outcomes around these people through experience, exposure, feedback, opportunity, practice, and so on. This lets us act in ways that can seem miraculous to others—especially if someone confuses our years of familiarity and practice for some kind of exceptional, one-off ability.</p> 

<p>By themselves, these sharper skills with humor are neither good nor bad. Sometimes they’re used for negative manipulation. Other times, we start relying on them, and we fall into a rut that prevents us from practicing other ways of relating to others. And sometimes we overextend ourselves—or trick ourselves into thinking we’re better at a sharp social skill than we really are.</p> 

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes we can generate a laugh in the moment, and so think we're "good" at sharp humor. But sometimes we don't realize the humor is followed by mistake-predominant emotions later down the line. 
     
     <p class="considertext">If we don't know if this happens, we don't know how good we are at these humor attempts in a broader sense.</p> 
      
 </div>

<p>But what <sem>is</sem> good is understanding how all this happens. It can help us deal with the humor we feel unexpectedly from high-velocity experiences, including when it’s part of negative manipulation—as well as help us observationally, by reducing how often someone's humor strikes us as confusing or mysterious.</p>
