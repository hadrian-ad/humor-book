    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Pushing someone to a humor outcome is a humor attempt</h1>


<p>When we're attempting to push someone into humor tripwires, we're making a <vocab>humor attempt</vocab>. A humor attempt tries to generate humor.</p>
   
<p>As we saw last section, humor attempts can look like just about anything. A humor attempt could be like a joke <callback>("and here I thought I had no standards!")</callback> or like irritated pushback <callback>("well I have a <sem>life</sem>")</callback>.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
        <p class="considertext">Something can be a humor attempt, whether or not it actually generates humor. If we make a joke intending someone to laugh and they don't, it's still a humor attempt&mdash;just an unsuccessful one.</p>
    </div>
    
    
 <p>In this book, a humor attempt is very broad. A joke can exist inertly in a book. The humor attempt would be <sem>using</sem> that joke—inclusive of the content, delivery, intention, situation, and so on. In this case, the joke would just be a part of the humor attempt:</p>

    <p>So if a hundred people tell the same joke, they're using one joke but making a hundred different humor attempts&mdash;since each person using the same joke would be:</p> 
    
<ul class="close-list">
        <li>talking to a different person </li>
        <li>using a different inflection</li>
        <li>have a different relation to the joke</li>
        <li>speaking at different times of day</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p><sem-weak>Anything</sem-weak> that intends someone to feel humor is a humor attempt. So bringing our parents <sem>tea</sem> is a humor attempt—so long as we want them to <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell> and <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome> and experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on. Bringing someone tea isn't a "joke"—but the tea is involved in a humor attempt anyway.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
        
        <p class="considertext">The tea would just be a small part of the overall humor attempt&mdash;our smile as we bring them tea, our timing, and so on would all be part of the humor attempt.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>As before, a humor attempt may or may not actually generate any humor. We may bring our parents tea, hoping to make them smile—but they may ignore us, or cry or shout in anger. In this case, it's still a humor attempt <callback>(we wanted them to experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, and so on)</callback>—just a humor attempt that didn't generate humor.</p>
    

<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Qualities.</headline> A humor attempt has qualities like velocity and a humor outcome "destination." They also have people involved. When Xiawei</p> 
       
       <p>This helps us clarify how things relate to an emotional situation. Not all jokes are humor attempts (we say them to make them hurt, not laugh), just like not insults are mistake-predominant attempts (we say them to make them laugh, not hurt).</p>
