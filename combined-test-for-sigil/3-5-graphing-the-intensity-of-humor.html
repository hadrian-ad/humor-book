Plotting the intensity of humor
</h1>
  <!--   03.50-->
  
<p>	
	Our actual experiences are much more nuanced than resulting in just “small” or “large” mistakes and OKs. We can better represent this by adding more sizes to our table: 
</p>

    <h2>Intensity of humor</h2>

	We can continue subdividing this table into smaller and smaller increments. But no matter how many increments we use, humor is felt most intensely the closer the sizes of mistakes and OKs are to 1:1. 
</p>

<p>
	We can turn this into a quantification metaphor by using a 1-10 scale for the size of mistakes and OKs. This lets us plot evaluations:

    Title="Introducing a quilt graph for emotions"
    Alt="This table has an x axis for units of mistake, and a y axis for units of OK. The closer the units are to balanced (x=y), the more intense the humor is. This is represented in the table by a diagonal dark line of most-intense humor. Less-intense humor is represented by lighter shades of grey on either side of the dark line."

<p>
We can notate our previous examples and place them on this chart:
</p>

<h2>A. Medium intensity humor</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Emma realizes she has to look after two dogs, instead of one.</narration> <notes>(&larr;size 4 mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Emma feels this probably isn’t an issue, and even if it is, the consequences aren’t immediately felt to be important.</narration> <notes>(&larr;size 6 OK)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent">Size <strong>4</strong> mistake and size <strong>6</strong> OK</p>
     </div>
     <img class="img-indent"
        src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor/3-5-1-quilt-graph-a.png"
        Title="Plotting evalauations on our table"
        Alt="We can plot Emma's evaluations on our intensity table. Her evaluations land close to the diagonal line of most-intense humor, somewhere in the gray section. She has fairly intense humor, but not most intense humor."
        style="max-width:33rem;"
        >
</div>

<h2>B. High intensity humor</h2>
<div class="h2"><div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Emma watches the scene in <i>Fired Fireman 3</i> where Chief realizes he has to look after huge household.</narration> <notes>(&larr;size 8 mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Emma knows this is a comedy series, knows how it ends, knows the rules of the fake world, understands the cues from the editing and acting&mdash;there’s no consequences.</narration> <notes>(&larr;size 8 OK)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Unlike Emma, Zoe feels the scene is a bit embarrassing too.</narration> <notes>(&larr;size 7 OK)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent">Size <strong>8</strong> mistake and size <strong>8/7</strong> OK</p>
        </div>
        
         <img 
        src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor/3-5-2-quilt-graph-b.png"
        Title="Plotting evalauations on our table"
        Alt="We can plot Emma's and Zoe's evaluations on our intensity table. Emma laughed the most, because her mistake and OK landed on the diagonal line of most intense humor. But Zoe's evaluations were slightly off this line, since her mistake was larger than her OK. So Zoe felt high-intensity humor, along with some embarassment."
        style="max-width:40rem;"
        >
        
    <p>
        In the example above, Emma and Zoe both felt high intensity humor. But while <term>Emma</term> felt a 1:1 ratio of mistake to OK, <em>Zoe</em> also felt some embarrassment too&mdash;since her evaluations were shifted toward the mistake corner at an 8:7 ratio of mistake to OK.
    </p>
    </div>
<h2>C. Low-intensity humor</h2>
<div class="h2">
   <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Emma watches the first Fired Fireman, where Chief realizes that, instead of just <term>one</term> dog, he has to look after <em>two.</em></narration> <notes>(&larr;size 2 mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Emma knows this is a comedy series, knows how it ends, knows the rules of the fake world, including that Chief is ultimately up to it&mdash;there’s no consequences.</narration> <notes>(&larr;size 8 OK)</notes>
    </p>
    <p class="vig-indent">Size <strong>2</strong> mistake and size <strong>8</strong> OK</p>
    </div>
     <img class="img-indent"
        src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor/3-5-3-quilt-graph-c.png"
        Title="Plotting evalauations on our table"
        Alt="We can plot Emma's evaluations on our intensity table. Her evaluations land far outside the line of most intense humor, since her OK is much larger than her mistake. She has very little humor."
        style="max-width:22rem;"
        >
    <p>
    </div>
    
<h2>D. No humor</h2> 
<div class="h2">
    <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Emma thinks she has to look after an entire family for three days.</narration> <notes>(&larr;size 9 mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
         <narration>Emma feels she was tricked or coerced into responsibility, and in way that was destructively burdensome and violatory.</narration> <notes>(&larr;size 2 OK)</notes>
    </p>
    
        <p class="vig-indent">Size <strong>9</strong> mistake and size <strong>2</strong> OK</p>
    </div>

        Emma’s evaluations change when Jennifer texted her. We can plot this change in evaluations by showing Emma’s evaluations going from 9:2 to 5:6:

     <img
        src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor/3-5-4-quilt-graph.png"
        Title="Plotting evalauations on our table over time"
        Alt="This table shows plotting over time. At first, Emma is far away from the line of most-intense humor, since her mistake is so much larger than her OK. But an arrow shows how this plotting changes after Jennifer's text, which shrinks the mistake and raises the OK. It brings Emma close to the line of most-intense humor (5 mistake, 6 OK), although a bit on the OK-predominant side."

        The numbers in these examples are arbitrary&mdash;there aren’t actually units of mistakes and OKs. Instead, we're using a quantification metaphor to help us see how humor's intensity is coherent, not random.
