Answering questions using sizes
</h1>
<!--   03.60-->

<p>
	Once we add sizes of mistakes and OKs to our model of humor, we can tangibly answer some questions that otherwise may seem abstract or difficult:  
</p>
<h2>
	Why does someone stressed not always laugh when everyone else does?
</h2>
<div class="h2"><div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Emma is stressed about her final coding project and is hunched over her laptop.</narration></p>
        
     <p><narration>Something happens across the room, which makes Zoe and Owen laugh&mdash;but it just makes Emma shake her head.</narration>
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A group that has different sizes of OK won’t react the same way to similar mistakes.  <term>Relaxed</term> people will have a <term>large</term> OK, while <em>stressed</em> people will have a <em>small</em> OK:

        Title="Flowchart of evaluations"
        alt="This flowchart has a mistake box labeled 'something across the room.' It flows to two options below: (1) a smaller OK box, labeled 'we're stressed,' or to (2) an equal-sized OK-box, labeled 'we're not stressed.' Beneath these two options are a visual callback to our scales: if the flowchart ends with the scales out of balance (1), there won't be humor -- if the chart ends with the scales in balance (2), there will be humor."

        When we're with stressed people, we'll sometimes see them feeling humor from things that seem minor to us. That’s because small mistakes can match their small OK <callback>(from being stressed)</callback>:

        Title="Flowchart of evaluations"
        alt="This flowchart has a small starting mistake box labeled 'buttons.' It flows into either (1) a balancing small OK box, labled 'we're stressed,' which leads to humor, or to (2) an unbalanced larger OK box, labeled 'we're not stressed,' which does lead to humor. The implication is that Emma will only feel humor at the buttons when stressed."

        Since relaxed people have a large OK, they often <sem>want</sem> to pursue large mistake activities&mdash;which can be emotionally difficult for stressed people with small OKs:

        <h2>Why are taboo jokes funny to close friends, but not to strangers?</h2>

                <narration>Amaya tells Minh a taboo joke, which shocks him and makes him laugh.</narration></p>

                    <narration>In fact, if someone who wasn't Amaya told him that joke, Minh thinks he would have been furious. </narration>

            <p>
                When we’re with <term>close friends</term>, we might have a <term>large OK</term> to balance with big mistakes&mdash;like comments that have forbidden content.</p> 
                
                <p>But when we’re around <em>strangers</em>, we often have a much <em>smaller OK</em>, which makes the mistake of the forbidden content oversize the OK.

<h2>Why do kids like breaking the rules?</h2>
<div class="h2">
   <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <speaker>Sam:</speaker> <speech>“While mom’s at the hospital tonight, I thought we’d break the rules a bit! How about we get pizza and eat it in front of the TV?”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Riley jumps with excitement. As they sit on the floor with pizza and watch one of her shows, she keeps saying</narration>
        “Isn’t this fun?”
    </p>
        </div>
         
    <p>
        Kids often feel humor at the things that break rules and routines, like:
    </p>
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            eating while watching videos
        </li>
        <li>
            going to sleepovers
        </li>
        <li>
            going on field trips
        </li>
        <li>
            helping bake
        </li>
        <li>
            making loud noises
        </li>
        <li>
            skipping school
        </li>
        <li>
            sleeping in a tent
        </li>
        <li>
            wearing costumes
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        These are large mistakes&mdash;they deviate from their expectations. Children feel humor when their friends or guardians <sem>also</sem> cue that these mistakes are OK. But children are stressed when breaking the rules <sem-weak>doesn’t</sem-weak> feel OK. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Adults have a similar relationship to rules. We laugh and have fun when we feel the mistake of breaking the rules are OK. This is true for all kinds of things, like:
    </p>
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            camping
        </li>
        <li>
            clubbing
        </li>
        <li>
            eating at an expensive restaurant
        </li>
        <li>
            trying new sexual things
        </li>
        <li>
            rioting
        </li>
        <li>
            setting things on fire
        </li>
        <li>
            shooting weapons
        </li>
        <li>
            splurging
        </li>
        <li>
            traveling
        </li>
        <li>
            using drugs
        </li>
        <li>
            watching violence
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
 
        <p>
            Like kids, when the mistake is <term>balanced</term> to our sense of security from negative personal consequences, we <term>enjoy</term> these activities. <callback>(We feel humor.)</callback></p> 
            
            <p>When the mistake is <em>unbalanced</em> with our sense of security from negative personal consequences, we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> <em>enjoy</em> these activities. <callback>(We <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> feel humor.)</callback>
        </p>
              </div>
    </div>
            <h2>Why do we sometimes laugh harder when we try to get serious?</h2>
        
            <div class="h2">
                    
        <div class="vignette">
        <p>
        <narration>Zoe, Owen, and Emma are working on a group project, but they can’t stop laughing and getting distracted. Owen wants to make progress.</narration>
            </p>
            <p>
            <speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Okay for <term>real</term>, we have to get <em>serious.</em>”</speech>
            </p> 
            <p>
            <narration>Everyone agrees and they all sober up and nod.</narration>
        </p>
        <p>
            <narration>Owen flips open his textbook, which causes Emma and Zoe to burst into laughter.</narration>
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Sometimes, too much effort to “get serious” can cause what it tries to prevent. By shrinking the OK, we'll now feel humor at small mistakes&mdash;like flipping open a textbook. 
        </p>
