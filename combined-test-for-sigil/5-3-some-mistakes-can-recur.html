Some mistakes recur 
</h1>
  
<p>
	Some things only produce mistakes once&mdash;like the punchline of a joke. 
</p>
<p>
	The <term>first</term> time we hear the punchline, it <term>deviates</term> from our expectations. The <em>second</em> time we hear the punchline, it's already <em>become</em> our expectations&mdash;so there's no mistake:

<p>
	But things are different when things deviate from integrated expectations&mdash;since then mistakes can be felt repeatedly at a high size:

	So some things generate humor three days in a row <callback>(putting on glasses)</callback>, but other things don't <callback>(hearing a joke)</callback>&mdash;which is partially determined by how integrated our expectations are.
