<!--    02.10 -->

<p>Since humor is an emotion, a <term>specific person</term> feels humor. Different people may feel different things—one person may feel <emotions>humor</emotions>, while another may feel something else:</p>
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Xiaowei is dropping his friend Lina off at their high school for the opening day of her play.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <speech>"Break a leg! Also: You look nervous as hell!"</speech></p>
        <p><narration>Lina gives him the finger on the way out.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Lina doesn't feel humor)</notes> <narration>Xiaowei laughs and gives the finger back.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Xiaowei feels humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Elias stops by to give Jessica and Emma a ride, but Jessica is running a bit behind. When she finally comes out of the bathroom, Elias makes a belittling comment about the slogan on Jessica’s shirt.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Elias feels humor)</notes></p>
        <p><narration>It makes Jessica laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels humor)</notes> <narration>It makes Emma furious.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn't feel humor)</notes></p>

        <p><narration>Bleary-eyed from staying up late, Zoe starts giggling.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels humor)</notes> <narration>Emma puts her head in her hands.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(despairing)</internalaction> <speech>“We’ll never finish,”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn't feel humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Amber visits Jennifer, and laughs at the cat wedged in a cardboard box.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Amber feels humor)</notes> <narration>But Jennifer has seen the cat there so often, she no longer notices anything.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer doesn't feel humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Since these outcomes are different for each person, we’ll need to be thoughtful about which perspective we’re looking at:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">    
            <li>Humor is an emotion <strong>Xiaowei</strong> feels when <strong>he</strong> evaluates a mistake as OK.</li>
            
        <li>Humor is an emotion <strong>Yasmin</strong> feels when <strong>she</strong> evaluates a mistake as OK.</li>
            
            <li>Humor is an emotion <strong>Jessica</strong> feels when <strong>she</strong> evaluates a mistake as OK.</li>
            
            <li>Humor is an emotion <strong>Zoe</strong> feels when <strong>she</strong> evaluates a mistake as OK.</li>
            
            <li>Humor is an emotion <strong>Amber</strong> feels when <strong>she </strong>evaluates a mistake as OK.
                </li>  </ul>
           
    <p>Because of this, we can update our model:</p>
    <p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion that <i>someone</i> feels when <i>they</i> evaluate a mistake as OK.</p>
