  We'll focus on humor, not genres
</h1>
  
<p>
	Instead of talking about humor, we sometimes drift into talking about "farces," "jokes," "irony," and so on instead. But this can distract us from understanding why we sometimes laugh, and why we sometimes don’t. 
</p>
<p>
	Like anything else, comedies, farces, jokes, irony, satires, witty remarks, and so on <sem>can</sem> generate <emotions>humor</emotions>—but they don’t always. Someone may or may not see mistakes in them, which they may or may not evaluate as OK:

These smaller circles sometimes intersect with humor, but don't always."

<p>
	So while our evaluations of jokes, comedies, wittiness, satire, and so on <term>can</term> lead to humor—our evaluations can <em>also</em> lead to any other emotion as well:

	Since we’re focusing on humor in this book, we won’t focus on jokes or satire—since those things aren’t humor. Humor is a particular emotional outcome&mdash;and we'll stay focused on why this outcome is or isn't reached.

	Consider:</p>
<p class="considertext">
	We'll be learning why <sem-weak>anything</sem-weak> does or doesn't lead to an outcome of humor. This is inclusive to jokes and satire—but inclusive to everything else besides. We won't need to focus on jokes to understand humor.</p>

<p><headline>Jokes and tentpoles.</headline> We sometimes idiomatically use “joke” as a tentpole word for humor—where everything that causes us to laugh is called a joke. But just because we have idiomatic ways of talking doesn't mean we should take those expressions at face value. <callback>("Everything we laugh at is a joke.")</callback></p>
    
<p>It's easy to see why we shouldn't take this literally. The reasoning would go like this:  <callback>"we sometimes laugh at jokes. Therefore <sem>everything</sem> we laugh at is some kind of joke."</callback> To see this as bizarre, we can create new variations: <callback>"we sometimes buy coffee. Therefore, <sem>everything</sem> we buy is some kind of coffee.”</callback></p>

 <p>For the same reason it would be strange to frame all <term>buying</term> around <term>coffee</term>—it would be strange to frame all <em>laughing</em> around <em>jokes</em>.</p>
