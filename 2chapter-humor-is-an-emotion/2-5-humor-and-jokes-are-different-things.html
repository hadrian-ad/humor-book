  humor and jokes are different things
</h1>
  
<p>
	Instead of talking about humor, we sometimes drift into talking about "farces," "jokes," "irony," and so on instead. But this can distract us from understanding why we sometimes laugh, and why we sometimes don’t. 
</p>
<p>
	Like anything else, comedies, farces, jokes, irony, satires, witty remarks, and so on <sem>can</sem> generate <emotions>humor</emotions>—but they don’t always. Someone may or may not see mistakes in them, which they may or may not evaluate as OK:

These smaller circles sometimes intersect with humor, but don't always."
    style="max-width: 16rem;">
    
<p>
	So while jokes, comedies, wittiness, satire, and so on <em>can</em> lead to humor—our evaluations can also lead to any other emotion as well:

	Since we’re focusing on humor, we won’t focus on jokes or satire—since those things aren’t humor. Humor is a particular emotional outcome, and we'll want to stay focused on why this outcome is or isn't reached.

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">
	Consider:</p>
<p class="considertext">
	We'll learn why <sem>anything</sem> does or doesn't lead to an outcome of humor. This is inclusive to jokes and satire—and inclusive to everything else besides. We won't need to focus on jokes or satire to understand how they work.

 <div class="box">    

<p><headline>Jokes and tentpoles.</headline> We sometimes use “joke” as a tentpole word for humor—where everything that causes us to laugh is called a joke. The reasoning goes like this: <callback>"we sometimes laugh at jokes. Therefore, everything we laugh at is some kind of joke."</callback> </p>
		
<p>This is pretty strange when we think about it! We can see how strange it is by making new variations: <callback>"we sometimes buy coffee. Therefore, everything we buy is some kind of coffee.”</callback> It would be strange to frame all <term>buying</term> around <em>coffee</em>—just like it's strange to frame all <term>laughing</term> around <em>jokes</em>.</p>
	
<p>What's happening is that we sometimes <sem>idiomatically</sem> call everything jokes. But we shouldn't take  idiomatic language straightforwardly <callback>("everything we laugh at is a joke")</callback>, for the same reason anything that becomes slang or an idiom shouldn't be taken literally.</p>
