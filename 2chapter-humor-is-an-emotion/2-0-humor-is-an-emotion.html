    <p>
        Humor is an <vocab>emotion</vocab>. 
    </p>

    <p>
        We usually think of things like anger, happiness, sadness, and so on as emotions—and we don’t always think of humor explicitly as an emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
        But humor behaves just like other emotions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We can feel <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term> grow over time, like over the course of a <term>funny story</term>—in the same way we can feel <em><emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes></em> grow over time, like over the course of an <em>infuriating story</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have physical reactions when we feel <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term>, like <term>smiles or laughs</term>—in the same way we have physical reactions when we feel <em><emotions-in-notes>sadness</emotions-in-notes></em>, like <em>sighing or tears</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            We sometimes have <term>bursts</term> of unexpected <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term>, which seem to come out of nowhere—in the same way we sometimes have <em>bursts </em>of unexpected <em><emotions-in-notes>grief</emotions-in-notes></em> or <em><emotions-in-notes>irritation</emotions-in-notes></em>, which seem to come out of nowhere.
        </li>
        <li>
            <term><emotions-in-notes>Humor</emotions-in-notes></term> has dimensions of <term>intensity and duration</term> to it—in the same way <em><emotions-in-notes>sadness</emotions-in-notes></em> or <em><emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes></em> has dimensions of <em>intensity and duration</em> to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Babies go through periods of <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term>—in the same way they go through periods of <em><emotions-in-notes>boredom</emotions-in-notes></em> or <em><emotions-in-notes>irritation</emotions-in-notes></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are <term>videos</term> oriented around making us feel <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term>—in the same way there are <em>videos</em> oriented around making us feel <em><emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes></em>, <em><emotions-in-notes>"aww"</emotions-in-notes></em>, <em><emotions-in-notes>amazement</emotions-in-notes></em>, <em><emotions-in-notes>empowerment</emotions-in-notes></em>, <em><emotions-in-notes>fear</emotions-in-notes></em>, <em><emotions-in-notes>frustration</emotions-in-notes></em>, <em><emotions-in-notes>mystery</emotions-in-notes></em>, <em><emotions-in-notes>grief</emotions-in-notes></em>, <em><emotions-in-notes>sadness</emotions-in-notes></em>, and so on.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">
        (and so on)
    </p>
    <p>
        Since humor behaves similarly to things like anger and sadness, we’ll be calling humor an <vocab>emotion</vocab> in this book.
    </p>


    

<div class="box">   
      <p><headline>Demystifying humor.</headline> Sometimes, without really thinking about it, we put humor into its own category:
        </p>
<img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-0-images/2-0-1-humor-excluded.png" title="Humor excluded" style="max-width: 18rem;"
        
        alt="This diagram shows humor as somewhere outside a cluster of what we typically think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, shame.">
        <p>
            If we seperate humor from everything else, humor becomes mysterious or hard to think about. But it’s less mysterious once we put similar things together:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-0-images/2-0-2-humor-included.png"
        style="max-width: 11rem;"
        title="Humor included"
        
        alt="This diagram evolves the previous diagram by putting humor in the same cluster of what we typically think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, shame."
        
        style="max-width: 13rem;">
        <p>
            By plugging humor into our existing understanding of our emotional lives, we’ll have a greater intuitive understanding of humor.
