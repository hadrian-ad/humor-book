    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">2. Humor is an emotion</h1>
    
    <p>
        Humor is an <vocab>emotion</vocab>. We can add this into our model:
    </p>
    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is an <strong>emotion</strong> that occurs when a mistake is evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    <p>
        We usually think of things like <emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>happiness</emotions>, <emotions>sadness</emotions>, and so on as emotions—but we don’t always think of <emotions>humor</emotions> explicitly as an emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
        But humor behaves just like other emotions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We can feel <emotions><term>humor</term></emotions> grow over time, like over the course of a funny story—in the same way we can feel <emotions><em>anger</em></emotions> grow over time, like over the course of an infuriating story.
        </li>
        <li>
            We have physical reactions when we feel <emotions><term>humor</term></emotions>, like smiles or laughs—in the same way we have physical reactions when we feel <emotions><em>sadness</em></emotions>, like sighing or tears.
        </li>
        <li>
            We sometimes have bursts of unexpected <emotions><term>humor</term></emotions>, which seem to come out of nowhere—in the same way we sometimes have bursts of unexpected <emotions><em>grief</em></emotions> or <emotions><em>irritation</em></emotions>, which seem to come out of nowhere.
        </li>
        <li>
            <emotions><term>Humor</term></emotions> has dimensions of intensity and duration to it—in the same way <emotions><em>sadness</em></emotions> or <emotions><em>anger</em></emotions> has dimensions of intensity and duration to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Babies go through periods of <emotions><term><em>humor</em></term></emotions>—in the same way they go through periods of <emotions><em>boredom</em></emotions> or <emotions><em>irritation</em></emotions>.
        </li>
        <li>
            There are videos oriented around making us feel <emotions><term>humor</term></emotions>—in the same way there are videos oriented around making us feel <emotions><em>anger</em></emotions>, <emotions><em>“aww,”</em></emotions> <emotions><em>amazement</em></emotions>, <emotions><em>empowerment</em></emotions>, <emotions><em>fear</em></emotions>, <emotions><em>frustration</em></emotions>, <emotions><em>mystery</em></emotions>, <emotions><em>grief</em></emotions>, <emotions><em>sadness</em></emotions>, and so on.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">
        (and so on)
    </p>
    <p>
        Since humor behaves similarly to things like anger and sadness, we’ll be calling humor an emotion.
    </p>
    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is an <strong>emotion</strong> that occurs when a mistake is evaluated as OK.
    </p>

    

<div class="box">   
      <p><headline>Demystifying humor.</headline> Sometimes, without really thinking about it, we put humor into its own category of thing:
        </p>
<img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-0-images/2-0-1-humor-excluded.png" title="Humor excluded" style="max-width: 18rem;"
        
        alt="This diagram shows humor as somewhere outside a cluster of what we typically think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, shame.">
        <p>
            If humor’s separated from everything else, it becomes mysterious or hard to think about. But it’s less mysterious once we put similar things together:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-0-images/2-0-2-humor-included.png"
        style="max-width: 11rem;"
        title="Humor included"
        
        alt="This diagram evolves the previous diagram by putting humor in the same cluster of what we typically think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, shame."
        
        style="max-width: 13rem;">
        <p>
            By plugging humor into our existing understanding of our emotional lives, we’ll be able to have a greater intuitive understanding of humor.
