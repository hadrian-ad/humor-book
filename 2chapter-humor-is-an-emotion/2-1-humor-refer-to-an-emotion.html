<h1 id="exclude-navigation">"Humor" refers to an emotion</h1>
   
     <p>Humor is a broad word in our conversations. At different times, we use the word “humor” to refer to a kind of:</p>
     
<ul class="close-list">
    <li><strong>comment</strong> <callback>(compliment, insult, <strong>humor</strong>, question, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>genre</strong> <callback>(drama, horror, <strong>humor</strong>, thriller, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>personality trait</strong> <callback>(gentleness, <strong>humor</strong>, temper, thoughtfulness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>quality</strong> <callback>(aggressive, beauty, <strong>humor</strong>, meanness, persuasiveness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>emotion</strong> <callback>(anger, <strong>humor</strong>, listlessness, sadness, and so on)</callback></li></ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>We see this fluidity of meaning all the time:</p>
    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe and Emma do a double take on a joke scribbled on a white board.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(disapprovingly)</internalaction> <speech>“Distasteful humor.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a comment or joke)</notes></p></div>
    
    <div class="vignette"><p><speaker>Amber:</speaker> <action>*to clerk*</action> <speech>“Hey, excuse me, I’m looking for the new Gram Bridgette book—is that in the memoir or humor section?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a genre)</notes></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Owen fills out his dating profile.</narration> 
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“The most important quality in a partner? Humor. For sure.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a trait)</notes> <action>*checks box*</action></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Timothy takes his residents on rounds.</narration></p> 
    <p><speaker>Timothy:</speaker> <speech>“Having a humorous name like Dr. Ailes is usually a good icebreaker.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a quality)</notes></p> 
    <p><narration>The residents chuckle loudly.</narration></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Emma goes to Zoe’s house for Thanksgiving. Everyone laughs a lot.</narration></p> 
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(pleased)</internalaction> <speech>“There’s a lot of humor at your house!”</speech>  <notes>(&larr;“humor” as an emotion)</notes> </p></div>

    <p>Most of the time, this breadth of meaning is a source of utility and rich meaning. But at the same time, if we're not careful, this fluidity can also cause us unnecessary confusion.</p> 
  

  <p>We'll avoid this confusion by <sem>only</sem> using "humor" to refer to an emotion in this book.

              <div class="consider">  
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">There’s nothing wrong with other ways we define or use the word humor&mdash;instead, problems come when we're inconsistent in how we use the word.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">We don't want to mean one thing by "humor" in one sentence, and another thing the next. To avoid flipping back and forth between meanings, this book will stick consistently to one definition of humor.</p>  
        </div>     
  
    


 <div class="box">    
    <p><headline>Sleight of hand.</headline> We often jump fluidly between different meanings of humor, even without noticing that we do:</p> 
   <div class="vignette">
         
            <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(curiously)</internalaction> <speech>“Jessica, what do you think about humor?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t clarify whether she’s asking about comments, a genre, a personality trait, a quality, or an emotion)</notes></p>
            <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <speech>“Ohmigosh, I am so bad at jokes!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jessica decides that Emma is asking about jokes)</notes> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“I once tried to tell Elias that joke the waitress told Chief in <i>Fired Fireman</i>…”</speech> <action>*stops to laugh*</action> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“… the one about the difference between boobs and an apron…?”</speech> <narration>*laughs harder*</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“… and I <sem>mangled</sem> it. God! I’m just not that good at humor. Never been funny. So there you go.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;conversation about humor turns into a conversation about jokes)</notes></p>
            <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <narration>*laughs*</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jessica helps Emma feel <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“I’ll never forget that time you messed up that <i>knock, knock</i> joke.”</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <internalaction>(recalling)</internalaction> <speech>“Knock, knock!”</speech></p>
    </div>
    

    
     <p>Jessica doesn't notice how she and Emma haven't settled on a meaning for the word "humor."</p>
     
      <p>Sometimes, this leads to strange results&mdash;like how Jessica says she's never been funny, even though she had just made herself and Emma laugh <callback>(feel <emotions>humor</emotions>)</callback> in their conversation. </p>
