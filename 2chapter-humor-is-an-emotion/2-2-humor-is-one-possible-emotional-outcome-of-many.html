    Humor is one possible emotional outcome of many
</h1>
    <p>Last chapter, we looked at evaluations as leading to either <emotions>humor</emotions> or <emotions>no humor</emotions>:
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sara laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>

    <p>But when we think of humor as an emotion, “no humor” could mean <em>any</em> other emotion:</p>

    <p>Last chapter, we said we’ll be as interested in when humor doesn’t occur as when it does. Here, we’re clearer about what it means for humor to not occur—it means <em>another</em> emotion happens instead.</p>
