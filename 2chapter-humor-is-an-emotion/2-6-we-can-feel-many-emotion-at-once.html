Small amounts of humor matter
</h1>
<!--    02.60 -->

<p>
	Sometimes, we only notice humor when it’s unambiguous and most of our emotional state&mdash;like when we’re laughing at a movie:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Emma and Owen are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title>.</narration></p> 
	
	<p><narration>Chief is hired to work at a warehouse, but his attempt to move crates of lobsters goes horribly, horribly wrong. Emma and Owen laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;just <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>

    style="max-width: 17rem;">
       
<p>
	Even though we sometimes seem to feel “one” emotion, most emotions happen in a mix—like when Jennifer feels humor and anger in her emotional state: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Jennifer looks up from her tablet. Where’s Riley? Her heart sinks in fear. She checks the street, then runs around the house. She sees Riley squatting quietly next to an anthill, and Jennifer puts a hand over her heart and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	<p>

I thought I told you to stay the side yard.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	</p>

   style="max-width: 24rem;">

<p>
	Above, Jennifer isn’t feeling humor and anger in equal proportions—instead, she feels a lot of humor and a small amount of anger in her emotional state. 
</p>
<p>
	We can see this in other examples as well:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Trevor walks into class and trips, and the cereal he’s carrying falls down his shirt.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>At first shocked, his classmates see that he’s not hurt and start to laugh with relief.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Trevor stands there, embarrassed, and laughs sheepishly. Red-faced, he goes to heads to the bathroom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>embarassment</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>

<p>
	<narration>Riley is bored at the dinner table, and Sam makes a funny face at her. Riley smiles and squirms with amusement and boredom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Riley feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>boredom</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>

    style="max-width: 18rem;">
	
<p>
	In complicated emotional states,  small amounts of humor mingle with more prominent feelings of bitterness, disappointment, sadness, and so on:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Emma sadly shuts the door to her apartment.</narration></p>
	<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“I can’t believe Sara didn’t tell me until today that she decided to move!”</speech></p> 
	<p><narration>She looks around. She feels angry, resentful, regretful, sad. A cloud of bitter humor passes through her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s complicated emotional state includes some <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	 <speech>“It sucks.” </speech>

<p>
	<sem>Most</sem> of the humor we feel in our lives isn’t big, simple moments of humor&mdash;instead, most of the humor we feel is just small twinges of humor, often as part of more complicated emotional moments.
</p>

<p>In this book, we'll be as interested in these small or complicated moments of humor&mdash;noticing and understanding them&mdash;as we are the big or simple moments of humor.</p>  

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">
	Consider:
</p>
<p class="considertext">
	Small amounts of humor matter to how we describe our emotional state. This is like how an all-blue panel is very different than a similar panel with an orange dot in the middle:</p>
	
<img class="img-indent" src="../images/2c-images-emotions/2-6-images/2-6-7-blue.png" title="Comparison of blue boxes" alt="Two blue squares are contrasted, one all-blue and the other all-blue with an orange dot in it."

style="max-width: 14rem;">

<p class="considertext">
We wouldn't accept someone insisting these were exactly the same, simply because both are <sem2>mostly</sem2> blue. The overall composition matters, not just the majority color.</p>

<p class="considertext">
	It's the same for our emotional state, where we can't ignore small amounts of humor while still being accurate to our experiences.
	
</p>

</div>

 <div class="box">    
		<p><headline>Brownies and importance.</headline> Sometimes we assume that the more <term>intense</term> an emotion is, the more that emotion <em>matters</em>—like that a twinge of humor wouldn't matter much if it happens alongside much more intense anger. We may even think we don’t even need to account for that humor at all.</p>
	<p>
		But we can use a comparison to food to see that that isn’t quite right. If we eat an orange-zest brownie, we wouldn’t say the orange-zest is unimportant just because chocolate is by far the most prominent flavor&mdash;and we wouldn't say we <sem-weak>only</sem-weak> taste chocolate.</p>
		
	<p>
		It’s the same for our emotions. We can't ignore small amounts of humor, since that flavors the entire experience. That’s why this book will be as inclusive of these small twinges of humor as it will be to intense moments of humor.

<div class="content-example">
   
   <p>This book's instigating source was Warren Shibles' <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;which is without a doubt one of the strangest books ever written.</p>
 
  <p>Shibles was an autistic philosopher who wrote prolifically on topics of love, humor, emotions, lies, metaphor, death, ethics, time, and more&mdash;and made almost no impression on anyone at all.</p>
          
   <p>An exception would be the author of this book&mdash;who ran into <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> as a teenager and thereafter became unescapably interested in humor. From this ususual starting place, the next decade and a half was spent taking notes on smiles and laughs and pondering it all.</p> 
          
      
    <p>The author is indebted to Shibles' ideas, as well as the example he set in terms of clarity and independence of thought. While much of this book is something the author incubated over a long time, it certainly would not exist without Shibles' book and pioneering self-publishing efforts.</p>
           
    <p>Finally, this book also takes his approach to "philosophical psychology"&mdash;learning about the world by organizing our experiences in a way that's both coherent and penetrating.</p>
     
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">The alternative is to think we need something to justify our own observations, like clinical psychology or evolutionary biology&mdash;essentially a pole we knot one end of our thinking too.</p>
            
        <p class="considertext">As useful as that is in some contexts, that can be overapplied. This is usually obvious to us in other areas&mdash;if we want to watch video essays on how beautiful movies are composed, it's often enough that they simply talk about movies.</p>
             </div> 
             
   <p>Outside of Shibles, the nutrients for this book came from a broad range of books and experiences. While these were generally not specifically about humor, many of them provide important clues and indications to the bigger story of humor&mdash;something we'll be talking about as we go through this book.</p>
