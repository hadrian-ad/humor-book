<h1 id="exclude-navigation">"Humor" refers to an emotion</h1>
    <p>Humor is a broad word in our day-to-day conversations. At different times, we use the word “humor” to refer to a kind of:</p>
<ul class="close-list">
    <li><strong>comment</strong> <callback>(compliment, insult, humor, question, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>genre</strong> <callback>(drama, horror, humor, thriller, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>personality trait</strong> <callback>(gentleness, humor, temper, thoughtfulness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>quality</strong> <callback>(aggressive, beauty, humor, meanness, persuasiveness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>emotion</strong> <callback>(anger, humor, listlessness, sadness, and so on)</callback></li></ul>
    <p>
        <i>(and so on)</i>
    </p>
    
    <p>We see this fluidity of meaning all the time:</p>
    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe and Emma do a double take on a joke scribbled on a white board.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(disapprovingly)</internalaction> <speech>“Distasteful humor.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a comment or joke)</notes></p></div>
    
    <div class="vignette"><p><speaker>Amber:</speaker> <action>*to clerk*</action> <speech>“Hey, excuse me, I’m looking for the new Gram Bridgette book—is that in the memoir or humor section?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a genre)</notes></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Owen fills out his dating profile.</narration> 
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“The most important quality in a partner? Humor. For sure.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a trait)</notes> <action>*checks box*</action></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Timothy takes his residents on rounds.</narration></p> 
    <p><speaker>Timothy:</speaker> <speech>“Having a humorous name like Dr. Ailes is usually a good icebreaker.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a quality)</notes></p> 
    <p><narration>The residents chuckle loudly.</narration></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Emma goes to Zoe’s house for Thanksgiving. Everyone laughs a lot.</narration></p> 
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(pleased)</internalaction> <speech>“There’s a lot of humor at your house!”</speech>  <notes>(&larr;“humor” as an emotion)</notes> </p></div>

    <p>Most of the time, this fluidity of meaning is a source of utility and rich meaning. But at the same time, this fluidity can also cause us unnecessary confusion if we're not careful.</p> 
    <p>We'll avoid this confusion by <em>only</em> using "humor" to refer to an emotion in this book.
     
       <div class="consider">  
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">There’s nothing wrong with other ways we define or use the word humor. We're just picking one way of defining "humor" in this book to prevent us from flipping back and forth between meanings.</p>

<!--      BOX BUTTON-->
       
<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Consequences of jumping</button>

 <div class="contentBOX">    
    <p>We often jump fluidly between different meanings of humor, even without noticing that we do. This can make conversations go in directions that we may or may not intend:</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(curiously)</internalaction> <speech>“Jessica, what do you think about humor?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t clarify whether she’s asking about comments, a genre, a personality trait, a quality, or an emotion)</notes></p>
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <speech>“Ohmigosh, I am so bad at jokes!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jessica decides that Emma is asking about jokes)</notes> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“I once tried to tell Elias that joke the waitress told Chief in <i>Fired Fireman</i>…”</speech> <action>*stops to laugh*</action> <speech>“… the one about the difference between boobs and an apron…?”</speech> <narration>*laughs harder*</narration> <speech>“… and I <em>mangled</em> it. God! I’m just not that good at humor. Never been funny. So there you go.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;conversation about humor turns into a conversation about jokes)</notes></p>
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <narration>*laughs*</narration> <speech>“I’ll never forget that time you messed up that knock, knock joke.”</speech></p>
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <internalaction>(recalling)</internalaction> <speech>“Knock, knock!”</speech></p>
    
    <p>Even though Jessica laughs <callback>(feels humor)</callback>, and makes Emma laughs with her story <callback>(feels humor)</callback>—Jessica still says she’s bad at humor because she’s bad at delivering prepared jokes.</p>
    
    <p>There’s nothing wrong about talking about jokes—but it can hinder our thinking if we don't notice that we're flipping between meanings of the word "humor."</p></div>
