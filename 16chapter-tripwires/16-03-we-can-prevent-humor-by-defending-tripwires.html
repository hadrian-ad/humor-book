<p>If Heather always reacts straightforwardly, Xiaowei knows he can disrupt her whenever he wants&mdash;and Heather feels vulnerable in conversation with him.</p>

      <p class="for-instance-text">
          When Heather recieves a sharp comment <callback>("when my shit turns blue")</callback>, her first thought is to react straightforwardly to it. <callback>(“He’s being rude so I should be offended.")</callback></p>
          
          <p class="for-instance-text">This kind of <callback>"if A then B has to follow"</callback> isn't always helpful&mdash;since Heather can actually react in any number of ways.</p> 
          
          <p class="for-instance-text">If she holds too tightly to <callback>"If A then B has to follow,"</callback> she'll be predictably reactive. This will cede her situational influence to whoever she's talking to, and narrow the range of possible outcomes for no reason.</p>

<p>Since Heather and Xiaowei continuously co-create emotional situations <sem-weak>together</sem-weak>, Heather has influence in what happens:</p>

    <p>Above, Heather prevents Xiaowei from feeling humor. She does this by defending the tripwires he was pushing toward.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t to say this is the best thing for Heather to do&mdash;or that preventing someone’s humor is good or bad. Instead, we’re just looking at how Heather has influence in whether Xiaowei feels humor or not&mdash;she’s an active participant in the emotional situation.</p> 
    </div>

<p>She can also try <sem>switching</sem> active topics&mdash;generating humor in Xiaowei on a topic of her choosing. This briefly disorients Xiaowei’s commitment to <humor-outcome>control the situation (by stonewalling his mother)</humor-outcome>:</p>

    alt="This vector figure has two tripwires in it, this time labeled as humor outcomes within a specific topic. When Xiaowei makes a joke to try to reach 'control a situation' tripwire on the topic 'job search conversation,' Heather changes topic and moves the situation ball across a humor outcome in the topic 'gaming successes.'";
    title="Changej of topic";
    style="max-width: 40rem; margin-left: " 
     >

    
<p>When Heather switches topic, it changes how we’d characterize Xiaowei’s humor:</p>

 <ul class="close-list">
     <li>When Xiaowei feels humor on the topic ‘ending conversation,’ he feels he’s <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>.</li> 
     
     <li>When Xiaowei feels humor on the topic ‘gaming successes,’ he feels Heather <humor-outcome>symbolized closed ties</humor-outcome> and that <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>Heather</outcome-contrast> controlled the situation</humor-outcome>.</li>
 </ul>


<p>Since no one has unilateral control over emotional outcomes, someone saying something "rude" doesn't predetermine outcomes&mdash;the other person's reaction co-creates the emotional situation.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Timing.</headline> It sometimes takes us a while to reach humor outcome tripwires. For instance, at <term>first</term> we might be <term>angry</term>&mdash;and it’s not until <em>later</em> that we get a different perspective and feel <em>humor</em>:</p>
