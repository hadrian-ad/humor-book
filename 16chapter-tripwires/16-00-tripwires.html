</div>


<p>The last few chapters we've talked about <a href="../14chapter-humor-outcomes/14-0-humor-outcomes.html">humor outcomes</a>. We can use a spatial metaphor to think about them&mdash;humor outcomes as <vocab>tripwires</vocab>.</p>
     
<p>If the situational ball crosses a tripwire, it triggers humor:</p>

    alt="This vector figure shows a ball labeled 'situational ball' with a vector arrow showing it's direction. The same ball is shown having crossed a tripwire, which is broken. The tripwire is annotated: 'when situation ball passes through a humor outcome tripwire, we feel humor.'";

<p>For instance, if Emma tries to evade Minh, she's pushing the situational ball toward the <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome> tripwire. If she successfully reaches that tripwire, she feels humor:</p>

    <p><narration>Emma sees Minh down the hall. Uh-oh. She owes him coffee money, and he’s been hurt she hasn’t repaid him yet. Emma dodges down an alternate route before Minh sees her. Phew.

<p>Throughout this chapter, we’ll use tripwires as a framing metaphor to think about when and why humor happens.</p>    
    

<p>Since we’re not the only influence on the situation, we may push for a tripwire&mdash;but not reach it for one reason or another:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma sees Minh down the hall. Uh-oh. She owes him some money, and he’s been hurt she hasn’t repaid him yet. Emma tries to dodges down an alternate route before Minh sees her.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>She's too slow. Minh mournfully catches her eye as she goes out of view. She’s obviously avoiding him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Well, fuck.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    
     </div>

    alt="This vector figure shows the situational ball being deflected by 'Minh mournfully catching Emma's eye, redirecting the situation's momentum away from the 'avoid conflict' tripwire.";

    alt="This vector image shows Sam pushing the situation toward a 'change negative emotions into positive ones' tripwire, only for the momentum to be redirected away when Riley defends the tripwire.";
    title="tripwire figure V";
    style="max-width: 28rem; margin-left: " 
     >
      

<p>When Riley squirms to avoid feeling humor, the situation hasn't yet reached an outcome&mdash;since Sam can continue to put pressure toward the tripwire with another funny face.</p> 
 
<p>At that point, Riley can then fully close the situation by resisting utterly&mdash;screaming or throwing a tantrum&mdash;or she can let the pressure push her across a humor outcome tripwire:</p>

 
     <img src=../images/16c-images-humor-tripwires/16-00-tripwires/16-00-5-example-riley-break-defense.png

    alt="This vector figure adds another step to the previous one. When Sam makes another funny face, in redirects the momentum one more time toward the 'change negative emotions into positive ones tripwire,' and the ball finally shoots through the tripwire with an annotation to the broken tripwire that says 'Riley and Sam feel humor when this outcome is reached.'";

<p>We'll talk about this in the rest of the chapter.</p>
