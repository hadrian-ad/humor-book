    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can focus on humor outcomes to generate humor</h1>
    
    
<p>We can  generate humor without even thinking about “humor.”</p> 

<p>When Sam focuses entirely on <humor-outcome>symbolizing close ties</humor-outcome> with Jennifer, he's also focusing on generating humor:</p>

   </div>
   
<p>Sam generates humor in Jennifer—he helps her feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">Sam didn't do this by focusing on funny voices, jokes, puns, silly dances, wit, or so on&mdash;instead, Sam just focuses on <humor-outcome>symbolizing close ties</humor-outcome>. If he successfully reaches this outcome with Jennifer, she feels humor.</p> </div>

<p>Similarly, Jessica can make customers laugh without involving anything she usually associates with humor&mdash;she can instead just focus on reaching humor outcomes:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*to a customer*</action> <action>*setting down condiments*</action> <speech>“Oh, I love your style!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jessica goes straight toward humor outcome tripwires)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*turns red*</action> <action>*brightens*</action> <action>*beams*</action> <speech>“Oh. Thanks!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin feels Jessica’s <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>changed her negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on)</notes></p>
    
    </div>
<p>Jessica made Yasmin feel humor without needing to use jokes or even think humor. That's because a compliment pushes Yasmin directly toward humor outcomes.</p>

<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
        <p class="considertext">When we realize we can use the outcome we want to reach as its own guide for how to get there, we exponentially broaden the methods we have available to generate humor.</p>
   </div>


<div class="box">
<p><headline>Associations.</headline> Sometimes we have such strong associations with certain methods used to generate humor <callback>(jokes, roasts, slapstick, so on)</callback> that our thinking becomes bound by them. But often it's helpful to think of those things as middlemen.</p> 
    
<p>A live roast is often most appreciated when viewers understand it as more <humor-outcome>symbolizing close ties</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizing</humor-outcome> than not. But, of course, if we want to <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome> with our partner, we don't have to have the middleman of a roast&mdash;we can just <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>.</p>

   <p>Learning to see the "middleman" aspect to formats or methods used to generating humor <callback>(using a joke as a middleman to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, or a roast as a middleman to <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>)</callback> is something that helps us see them more clearly, and not confuse a means for the ends.</p>

<p>Jessica can make customers laugh by pushing them into humor outcomes. She has two ways of going about this.</p> 
 
         <ul>
       <li>Jessica could <term>first</term> pick a <em>topic</em>, like 'Yasmin's style.' Then, she thinks about what she can say about this specific topic that would <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolize ties</humor-outcome>, and so on. <callback>("Oh, I love your style!")</callback></li>
        
        <li>Jessica could <term>first</term> pick a <em>humor outcome</em>, like <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>. She then thinks about what topic she could reveal a personal view on. This may be 'Yasmin's style,' 'her opinion of football,' 'what she thinks of the weather,' or so on.</li>
        </ul> 

<p>If Jessica does either method successfully <callback>(reaches a humor outcome)</callback>, she’ll generate humor. And she'll do this without giving any thought about how this relates to any other connotations we sometimes have with humor. <callback>("I should be zany.")</callback> </p>
