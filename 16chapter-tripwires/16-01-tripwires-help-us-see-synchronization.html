<p>When our evaluations are synchronized, everyone sees the situational ball as moving similarly&mdash;so synchronized people all feel humor at around the same time:</p>

    alt="This figure shows two vector figures, one from Emma's perspective and one from her brother's. They both behave the same, and so feel humor for the same time for the same reason. An annotation notes that the two are synchronized, since the situational ball is identical in both perspectives.";

<p>By contrast, when we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> have synchronized evaluations, the situational ball isn't seen as the same:</p>

    alt="There are two vector figures, one from Trevor's perspective and the other from Yasmin's perspective. For Trevor, the situational ball reaches 'avoid conflict' tripwire, but for Yasmin it doesn't. When superimposed, the situational ball goes different places for different people.

        <p class="considertext">We're looking at <vocab>evaluatory perspective</vocab>. Sometimes we share the same evaluatory view of something, and so we react similarly <callback>(synchronized evaluations)</callback>&mdash;sometimes we realize we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> share the same view, and so react differently <callback>(desynchronized evaluations)</callback>.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">
             We can use humor outcomes to think narratively about this. If we both feel someone did or didn't <humor-outcome>handle criticisms</humor-outcome>, we'll react similarly&mdash;but if one of us laughs and the other frowns, we'll have different evaluatory perspectives on whether someone <humor-outcome>handled criticisms</humor-outcome>.

<aside class="box"><p><headline>Resynchronize.</headline> When Trevor pranks Yasmin, we can describe Trevor’s humor as a <term>“good”</term> experience <term>for Trevor</term>&mdash;even at the same time we also see his humor outcomes as related to a <term2>"bad"</term2> experience <term2>for Yasmin</term2>, since she felt angry and hurt.</p>
    
    
    <p>We treat others as equals when we care about synchronizing our evaluations. So if Trevor wants to treat Yasmin as an equal, he has to both notice and care about their desynchronized evaluations. By <sem-weak>resynchronizing</sem-weak>, they'll eventually feel mutual humor&mdash;mutual<emotions> reconciliation</emotions>.</p> 
    
    <p>This resynchronization will probably best be initiated and guided by Trevor, since he took the action that led to desynchronization in the first place. To do so, he’ll have to bring their situational balls back into greater alignment. This means converging on a shared evaluatory perspective.</p>
       
        <p>The first step is for Trevor to notice their diverging emotional states. The next step is to give equal weight of consideration to Yasmin’s evaluations as he does to his own evaluations. If both people put in this effort, they'll become become more and more resynchronized.</p>
