    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">It can take several steps to reach tripwires</h1>
    
    
<p>Humor is something we develop a situation toward. Sometimes this happens quickly, in what seems like a <term>single</term> step&mdash;other times it happens more slowly, over what seems like <em>many</em> steps:</p>

             <img src=../images/16c-images-humor-tripwires/16-06-it-often-takes-many-steps-before-we-feel-humor/16-06-0-steps-to-humor.png

    alt="This image shows two vector figures side by side, the first labeled 'one step to humor,' the other labeled 'many steps to humor.' In the first, the situation develops quickly to humor, and in the second the momentum of the situational ball changes frequently, and the situtation develops slowly to humor.";
    title="Steps to humor";
    style="max-width: 33rem ; margin-left: "

<p>In both cases above, humor happens after <sem>time</sem>. Even when humor happens quickly, it's not instantaneous.</p>

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">When we listen to a quick pun, we still have to listen to it&mdash;when we hike to the top of a scenic overlook, we still have to hike there. In both cases, our evaluations are changing over time.</p>

    <p>    
    It's obvious it sometimes takes a while to reach a humor outcome—like how we can't always <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome> in one sentence. That's because the person we’re talking with may:</p> 

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>disagree with us at first</li>
        <li>not understand the argument</li>
        <li>ask for clarification</li>
        <li>need more context</li>
        <li>give a counterpoint</li>
        <li>take time to think it over</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To push them into a humor outcome, we have to be aware of how and why their tripwire is guarded, and be responsive to those guards. It’s only after a shared development of the emotional situation that they’ll feel we’ve <humor-outcome>supported our argument</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>It’s the same for all humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on. Sometimes, we reach these outcomes quickly—but other times, we have to develop the situation that way over initial guardedness.</p>

<p>If we thought a humor attempt had to be successful from the first sentence, we’d be playing a game with the wrong rules—and we’d often struggle to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on: </p>

<p>Humor takes some situational assembly—which is why it’s often helpful to think of humor as the <term>conclusion</term> that we work toward, rather than <em>beginning</em> that starts something.</p>

A deeper look (Outcome-first)
    
    </button>     
     
<div class="content-example">

<p>We can use each humor outcomes as a method of generating humor. So if we ask: <callback>"How do I generate humor?"</callback> we can answer ourselves with a humor outcome:</p> 
        
        <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
           <li>“How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>”</li>
            <li>"How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>"</li>
            <li>"How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>helping someone become accepted</humor-outcome>"</li>
               </ul>   
          <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
        
        <p>This lets us take an abstract question <callback>("how do I generate humor?")</callback> and downsize it into something tangible&mdash;since we already have an idea on how to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>.</p> 
        
<p>Loosely, we have two different approaches when thinking about generating humor:</p> 

<ul style="list-style: none">
   <li>An <vocab>emotion-first</vocab> approach, which treats a humor outcome as a consequence of humor. <callback>("If they laugh, they'll reach a humor outcome.")</callback></li>
    <li>An <vocab>outcome-first</vocab> approach, which treats humor as a consequence of a humor outcome. <callback>("If they reach a humor outcome, they'll laugh")</callback></li>
    </ul>

<p>These two approaches let us talk about the same thing in different ways:</p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
   <li><strong>Emotion-first:</strong> <callback>“If he laughs, I’ll have handled his criticism”</callback></li>
    
    <li><strong>Outcome-first:</strong> <callback>“If I handle his criticism, he’ll laugh”</callback></li>
    
        <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-outcome-first/cl-0-he-laugh-handle-criticism.png

    alt="This figure has a double-sided arrow linking 'he laughs' on the left to 'I've handled his criticism.' on the right. An arrow approaching things from the left is labeled 'emotion-first thinking' and another from the right is labeled 'outcome-first thinking.'";
    title="Approach";

    </ul>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li><strong>Emotion-first:</strong> <callback>“If I feel humor, I’ll have dealt with a taboo topic”</callback></li>
    
    <li><strong>Outcome-first:</strong> <callback>“If I deal with a taboo topic, I’ll feel humor”</callback></li>

    title="";

    </ul>

    <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">    
            
    <li><strong>Emotion-first:</strong> <callback>“If they feel humor, I’ll have eased their tensions.”</callback></li>
        
    <li><strong>Outcome-first:</strong> <callback>“If they ease their tensions, they’ll feel humor.”</callback></li>

                </ul>
                
    <p>Essentially, this is like solving X = Y. We can solve the same equation by approaching either end. In our lives, we tend to be most familiar with emotion-first thinking&mdash;which is a bit like thinking we could only ever solve for X.</p> 
    
    <p>But when we realize we can <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> solve for Y, we'll have much greater flexibility in how we think about different situations.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">
    If we're welcoming a new person to our team, we know we'll want them to smile or laugh. If we frame our question as "how can we make them smile or laugh" <callback>(emotion-first)</callback>, we'll call to mind a set of things like jokes, funny voices, goofy icebreakers, and so on.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Alternatively, if we frame our question as "how can we <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>" <callback>(outcome-first)</callback>, this calls to mind a different set of things&mdash;maybe a thoughtful gift, individualized time, hospitality, displays of equality, and so on.</p>
        
    <p class="for-instance-text">By reframing the question to center around humor outcomes, we can think beyond our usual associations to other things that still produce smiles and laughs when done successfully.</p>
       
    </div>

<p>The point of all this isn't that there are "two ways" of going about things&mdash;it's instead to help jog our thinking into new perspectives how we go about making emotional actions in our lives.</p> 
  
<p>It's also a way of thinking about how we can find synergies from a network of humor skills: since all humor outcomes are connected, improving at <humor-outcome>supporting arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on improves our skill at <emotions>humor</emotions>—and improving our skill at <emotions>humor</emotions> improves our ability to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
   
<p>In this sense, a rising tide lifts all boats&mdash;improving at humor makes us better at all these different humor outcomes, especially as we gain greater awareness to the sources and breadth of humor.</p>
