<p>It can take work to reach humor outcomes&mdash;which means don't have to give up pushing toward a humor outcome if we don't reach it right away.</p> 

<p>We know this with polite refusals&mdash;if someone politely declines our offer of something to drink, we know that in some situations we push a little more:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Yasmin goes to the bathroom, leaving Trevor sitting awkwardly at the table with her mother and siblings.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>There’s an awkward pause. Then Yasmin’s mother gets up.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin's mother:</speaker> <speech>“Want some tea, pop, water?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother tries to makes Trevor feel accepted)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*shakes head*</action> <speech>“No thank you, I’m good.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor resists this humor outcome with a polite refusal)</notes></p>

<p>While this is familiar for <term>polite</term> refusal, it's the exact same thing for <em>impolite</em> refusals too:</p>

<p>The difference between the polite and impolite refusals is smaller than it seems at first. They’re both part of positional movement within an evaluatory situation. One person is pushing the situation toward a humor outcome&mdash;another is trying to deflect from that outcome.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This partnered motion within a situation is how <sem>all</sem> humor happens, everywhere&mdash;not just for <humor-outcome>opening a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, but for <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>, and so on too.</p>
    
        <p class="considertext">More often than not, humor outcomes are reached after a give-and-take and push-and-pull&mdash;something that often involves resistance and tension before emotional outcomes are reached.</p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Declining.</headline> The offer of something to drink is just a means to Yasmin's mother's ultimate goal&mdash;which is for Trevor to feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Knowing this ultimate goal, Trevor can know how to decline the drink effectively. He'll have to pair his <callback>"no thanks"</callback> with humor tells&mdash;so Yasmin’s mother will see that he <humor-outcome>feels accepted</humor-outcome>.</p> 
      
      <p>If her goal is reached, she'll be happy to stop insisting on a drink&mdash;and Trevor will have effectively declined the drink and ended more offers of hospitality.</p>
       
<p>Otherwise, if Trevor just tries to explain why he doesn't want a drink <callback>("I'm not thirsty")</callback>,  Yasmin's mother will just offer something else in pursuit of her goal of making Trevor feel <emotions>welcome</emotions>. </p>  
 
      
     <div class="consider">
         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             <p class="considertext">It's the same whether we're declining or <sem>accepting</sem> an offer. It's not enough for Trevor to simply <term>take</term> the drink without smiling&mdash;for the same reason he can't simply <em>refuse</em> the drink without smiling.</p>
             
            <p class="considertext">Whether accepting or declining an offer, we have to express humor tells when their goal is helping us reach a humor outcome. Otherwise, they see us as feeling <emotions>alienated</emotions>, <emotions>uncomfortable</emotions>, <emotions>unwelcome</emotions>, and so us.</p>
