<p><book-title>The Humor Textbook</book-title> is a clean course on humorâ€”a learning resource on smiling and laughing that's accessible, clear, coherent, practical, and straightforward.</p>

<p>By starting at the beginning and  reading through to the end, you'll learn an elegant and productive model of humor. By the end, you'll be able to answer big and small questions about when and why we laugh and smile.</p>

	alt="This image is a composite of three different photos. Each photo shows atypical signage.
	
	Photo 1 has chalk writing above a hard-to-read danger sign, so it now reads 'unreadable signs cause ... danger.'
	
	Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
	
	Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
	
	At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"

<p>Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction. Instead, this book provides catalytic insight to our experiences with humor. This insight helps us organize our lifetime of observations into a coherent system.</p>
