<p class="main-subtitle">An Introduction to Humor Dynamics</p>
<hr>

<body>  
    
    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">
Welcome!
</h1>


<p>This book is an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>&mdash;one of the most important subjects in the world, and also one of the least studied.</p>
 
 <!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
     
    <p class="considertext">Most people take a class on geometry&mdash;but few people take a class on smiling and laughing!</p>
    

</div>
-->
<!--
<p>When we think of laughing, we often think of jokes. But, of course, <term>laughing</term> and <term>jokes</term> are two different things&mdash;a bit like how <em>eating</em> and <em>burgers</em> are two different things.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
     
    <p class="considertext">Not only is "eating" much wider than burgers, but you can have a burger and <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> eat it&mdash;in which case, a burger isn't exactly related to eating at all.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">In the same way, not only is "laughing" much wider than jokes, but you can hear a joke and <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> laugh at it&mdash;in which case, a joke isn't exactly related to laughing at all.</p>
</div>


<p>In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing.</p>
-->
    <!--    
<p><vocab>Humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab> deals with <sem>change</sem> that characterizes that humor&mdash;<term>where</term> humor comes from and <term>why</term>, <em>where</em> it goes and <em>what</em> happens because of it.</p>

<p>The dynamics of humor are some of our most familiar experiences:</p>
   -->

<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Zoe is nervous, but Emma cracks a joke. Zoe laughs and becomes more comfortable.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor dynamics)</notes></p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Owen is ruminating, but then his professor compliments his work. It makes Owen beam, and he laughs easily for a while after.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor dynamics)</notes></p> 
</div>

<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Jessica  drops something and laughs. Then, overwhelmed, she starts to cry.</narration></p> 

<p><narration>Emma talks with her until Jessica wipes her eyes and gives a small laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor dynamics)</notes></p> </div>
 
<p>Above, the smiles and laughs didn't happen in isolation. Instead, they're part of dynamic experiences.</p>
             
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext">  When Emma cracks a joke, the point of interest isn't so much Emma's <term>joke</term>, but Zoe's <em>change</em> from nervous to comfortable. This sort of dynamic is the focus of this book.</p>
            
      
      <!--
      <p class="considertext">Depsite how familiar these dynamics are, we don't always know how to talk about them. It's a bit like trying to talk about why we like a song&mdash;it can become elusive as soon as we try!</p>
      -->
</div>

<p>Despite how familiar these dynamics are, they're often outside our ability to talk about. It's a bit like trying to explain why we like a song&mdash;something we experience effortlessly is hard to convey.</p>
    
    <!--

    <p>When we stop to notice it, we smile and laugh all the time, like when we:</p>
    
              
   <ul class="close-list">
          <li> are given a compliment</li>
           <li>are insulted</li>
           <li>are hugged</li>
           <li>hear a joke</li>
           <li>receive a gift </li>
           <li>are kissed</li>
               <li>bike downhill</li>
           <li>come to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>put clothes on fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realize we've been foolish</li>
           <li>are pressured successfully</li>
           <li>feel a gust of wind</li>
           <li>finish a workout</li>
           <li>see a fox</li>
           <li>win a game</li>
           <li>lose badly</li>
           <li>enter a beautiful room</li>
           <li>see something disgusting</li>
           <li>recall an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
 
<p>To make matters more confusing, we sometimes <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> laugh at these things&mdash;or laugh at their opposites!</p>

<p>In this book, we'll call all these experiences of laughing and smiling <vocab>humor</vocab>&mdash;and explain it all through the same system, whether dynamically related to jokes, misfortune, praise, and so on.</p>
-->

<p>In this book, we'll learn to describe and understand these experiences. This will make us more capable in our ability to generate and understand smiles and laughs&mdash;and let us uncover some surprising, important insights.</p>

<p>Everyone has a lifetime of experiences with humor. This book takes a careful look at those experiences, to see what insight we can gain about the world.</p>

        <p><headline>Everywhere.</headline> Humor can happen all across our lives&mdash;when aroused, bitter, confused, frustrated, joyful, sad, triumphant, and so on. <book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> explains this variety through the same system.

    <p class="considertext"><term>Humor</term> is often approached through <term>comedy</term>, which would be a bit like trying to understand <em>eating</em> by looking at <em>burgers</em>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Not only is "eating" much broader than burgers&mdash;we don't <sem-weak>have</sem-weak> to eat burgers. Focusing on burgers to explain eating would not necessarily be the best approach, and maybe even lead to problems.</p>

<p>In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing. It's something that happens, or is felt. This isn't static&mdash;humor has a "rise and fall" element to it.</p>

<p>To understand this rise and fall, we'll have to think about <vocab>humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab>. That means thinking about changes&mdash;about  <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh, and what that <sem>does</sem> to people and situtations.

<p>We can break things down a bit. In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing. It's something that happens, or is felt.</p>

<p>This book is an  introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>. For most of us, this is an unfamiliar term for familiar experiences:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>We're nervous, but when someone cracks a joke we become more comfortable.</li>
    <li>We're feeling pretty neutral, but when someone compliments our work our mood jumps and we laugh easily for a while.</li>
    <li>We're crying as we talk to someone, untli we eventually smile and wipe our eyes.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Above, our smiles and laughs mark experiences of change&mdash;what this book refers to as humor dynamics. </p>
              
<p>While these dynamics are as familiar to us as breathing, we don't always know how to talk about them.</p>

<p>This book provides an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>: <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we laugh and smile&mdash;and what happens when we do.</p>

<p>Let's look at a few examples:</p>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
 
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
       
                           
<div class="vignette">
 
<p>
 
    <narration>Alina is talking on the phone with her younger brother, Artem.</narration></p>
 	<p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“I’m sorry things are rough right now. Lots of people have troubles after high school. There’s no shame in being depressed. Listen, I have to go, but I’ll call you soon.”</speech> <action>*hangs up*</action> 

</p>

	<p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*sits back*</action> <internalaction>(thunderstruck)</internalaction> <speech>“I have depression!?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>“That makes so much sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”</speech>
 
</p> 
    </div>
                     
<p>Above, why did Yasmin and Artem laugh? We probably have an inuitive idea about this&mdash;but this intuition can be hard to put satisfyingly into words for even one instance of humor, let alone many.</p>
                                       
<p>Similarly, we know that humor marks an inflection of some kind in a situation&mdash;but this inflection too can be hard to express with confidence.</p> 
                     

   
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

    
            
 <p>We notice these dynamics all the time. People laugh or smile after:</p>
        
<p>Have you ever smiled or laughed after:</p>
          
  <ul class="close-list">
          <li> being given a compliment</li>
           <li>hearing an insult</li>
           <li>getting hugged</li>
           <li>hearing a joke</li>
           <li>receiving a gift </li>
           <li>being kissed</li>
               <li>biking downhill</li>
           <li>coming to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>putting on clothes fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realizing you've been foolish</li>
           <li>feeling a gust of wind</li>
           <li>winning a game</li>
           <li>losing badly</li>
           <li>seeing something disgusting</li>
           <li>recalling an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
       
       <p>Of course, people don't always laugh and smile at these things&mdash;so what's going on here? What's the shared pattern between all moments of smiling and laughing? And what <sem-weak>happens</sem-weak> in a situation because of humor?</p> 
          
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">When someone compliments us and we smile, something has happened in the situation. When we crest a hill and have a scenic view and we laugh, something has happened in the situation. What is it that's happening?</p>  
             
    </div>   
                        


   <p>         We'll start by describing the pattern to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;not just for jokes, but all across our lives. As we'll come to notice, we smile and laugh all across our lives:</p>
