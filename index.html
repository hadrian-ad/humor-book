<p class="main-subtitle">An Introduction to Humor Dynamics</p>

<body>  
    
<h1 id="exclude-navigation">
    Welcome!
</h1>
  
<p>This book provides a strong introduction to humor dynamics&mdash;an understanding of what humor is, and how it works and plays out in specific and general situations.</p>
	
<p>This means starting with <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile or laugh:</p>
	

	    <img src="images/0c-images-welcome/0-0-welcome/0-funny-signs.png" 
	        
	        style="max-width: 33rem; margin-left: 1rem;"
	        
	        alt="This image is a composite of three different photos. Each photo shows atypical signage.
	        
	        Photo 1 has chalk writing above a hard-to-read danger sign, so it now reads 'unreadable signs cause ... danger.'
	        
	        Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
	        
	        Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
	        
	        At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"
	        
	        title="why are things funny?">
	   
<p>But this book is foremost about <sem-weak>people</sem-weak>&mdash;so we won't just be looking at signs <term>themselves</term> <callback>("why are these signs funny?")</callback>, but people <em>looking</em> at the signs. <callback>("Why would someone in particular find a sign funny?")</callback></p> 

<p>We'll then be looking at what all this does to everyone.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">For instance:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Humor dynamics are everywhere. Have you ever shared a glance and smile with a stranger? Laughed after opening a perfect gift? Felt annoyed by the people laughing the table over? Listened to a joke that made the room tense?</p>  
    
    <p class="considertext">These are examples of the sort of dynamics around humor we'll be looking at&mdash;something inclusive to laughter, but a bit broader as well.</p>
    
    </div>

 
    
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics from beginning to end&mdash;you'll finish substantially better at observing, describing understanding, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

<p>It'll be at least somewhat fun and very interesting&mdash;you'll see!</p>
