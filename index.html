<div class="for-instance"><p class="consider">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">What happens when you share a smile with someone? Why does laughter vary in intensity? What do moments of laughter all share? How can we describe all this in ways that feel clear and satisfying to our experiences? </p>

<p>To gain fluency in humor dynamics, we'll be going through a careful sequence of ideas&mdash;and using thousands of examples, hundreds of figures, and dozens of case studies.</p>    

<p>By the time you finish, you'll have become significantly better at observing, describing understanding, and producing humor&mdash;which will feel like like opening a curtain to let in the light and view, the delight of new possibilities.</p>

   If we read a book about streets, it's not that we're not familiar with streets&mdash;it's that there's a lot to learn about them.

    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>                                           
    <p class="considertext">There are two main challenges to learning about humor dynamics. The first is how familiar it is&mdash;it's a bit like having to pay attention to our own nose.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The second is how vast it is. It's a bit like the story of the blind men who try to figure out what an elephant is by each touching a different part of it. This leads to contradictions that seem hard to consolidate. <callback>("It's a tree trunk!" "No, it's a rope!")</callback></p>
    
    <p class="considertext">So humor dynamics are essentially like having to first focus on our nose, which is also an elephant-puzzle!</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Thankfully, it's not so hard when everything is laid out. It's enjoyable too&mdash;it's a bit like opening the curtains to let in the light and reveal the view.</p>

<!--
      <p class="considertext">One of the first steps is observational&mdash;we often notice but don't notice smiles and laughter around us. By getting a life-accurate sample, we'll have a stronger basis for making sense of the dynamics of humor.</p>

                Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
                
                Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
                
                At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"
                
                title="why are things funny?">
           
<p>Humor dynamics let us think about all kinds of things&mdash;from:
 <ul class="close-list">   
             <li>what the sign makers were thinking (or not thinking)</li>
             <li>why someone laughed (or didn't laugh) as long or hard as they did</li>
             <li>how laughing (or not laughing) changed someone's relation to the sign's message</li>
             <li>how laughing (or not laughing) influenced their memory of the event</li>
             <li>how did someone nearby react to them laughing (or not laughing)?</li>
             </ul>
     
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
     
<p>As an introduction to these humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak>, we'll be focusing on how people interact and how their reactions change&mdash;all over time, in relation to humor.</p>
     

    <p>The difference between studying something like "jokes" and something like "humor dynamics" is analogous to the difference between studying garden <term>flowers</term> and studying <em>gardening</em>.</p>
