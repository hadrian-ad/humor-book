Welcome!
</h1>

<p>This book provides an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>&mdash;thinking about what humor is, how it works, and what it does in specific and general situations.</p>

<p>Essentially, we'll be exploring a mystery: <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> do we smile and laugh?</p>

<p>How can we understand and think about this smiling and laughing&mdash;not just in response to jokes, but all across our lives?</p>
    
    
<p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
