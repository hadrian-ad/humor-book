<p>What does one get when one stacks their odious pamphlets and other wretched miselannia too high? Their own death, it seems, as happened to the neurotic Hadrian DeMaioribus, who was found crushed under his own printed detritus when the stacks tipped over on him, also knocking over his buckets set up around room to catch the leaks in his ceiling, the spilled water catching the live wires carelessly strewn about and eletrifying him with the other rodents and cockroaches of his hovel.</p>

<p>
    The surprise of this book was that it was written at all&mdash;that a man of such unseemly temper and aggrandization as Hadrian&mdash;who used to yell at me at me before, during, and after class&mdash;could produce a text as lucid and genre-defining <book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> at all.
</p> 

A classic in its field, it has reached it's third edition.

<div class="about-box">
<p>There's is a textbook on humor&mdash;a resource that's accessible, clear, coherent, practical, and straightforward. </p></div>



<p>Welcome to <book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title>! As you've probably noticed&mdash;there's something about humor that's hard to put into words. </p>


<p>This gets into the majestic willfulness of smiling and laughing, and the secretive flittering of what it all means. This is what we'll be trying to capture&mdash;gently, concretely&mdash;in this book.</p>

<p>Long long ago, I was the sort of person who wrote down jokes in a little notebooks. There's the caticlism</p>

<p>I remember when I was six, and my arm got trapped under a treadmill, shredding my skin. My dad, as he always could when I cried, made me laugh.</p>

<p>Of course, my dad would always laugh when he watched people get hurt&mdash;but not <sem-weak>meanly</sem-weak> laugh, exactly.</p> 



<p>Partly it's the <term>breadth</term> of situations they occur in&mdash;and their <term2>variety</term2>. 

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">Growing up, my dad illustrated to me all the perplexities around smiling and laughing.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">He rarely laughed at animated comedies, but often chuckled when people got hurt&mdash;not meanly, exactly. And he could unfailingly make me laugh and feel better when I got hurt as a child.</p>

      <!--
      <p class="considertext">Depsite how familiar these dynamics are, we don't always know how to talk about them. It's a bit like trying to talk about why we like a song&mdash;it can become elusive as soon as we try!</p>

<p>Over the course of this book, we'll be becoming intimitately familiar with humor&mdash;and improve significantly in our ability to describe and create humor.</p>
