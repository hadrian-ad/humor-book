<p class="main-title">Humor in Various Moods and Meters</p>

<p class="main-subtitle">An Introduction to Humor Dynamics</p>
<hr>

<body>  
    
    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">
Welcome!
</h1>


<p>This book is an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>&mdash;one of the most important subjects in the world, and also one of the least studied.</p>

 <p>For most of us, "humor dynamics" is a new term for familiar experiences:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Zoe is nervous, but Emma cracks a joke. Zoe laughs and becomes more comfortable.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor dynamics)</notes></p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Owen is ruminating, but then his professor compliments his work. He smiles and laughs easily for a while after.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor dynamics)</notes></p> 
</div>

<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Jessica  drops something and laughs. Then, overwhelmed, she starts to cry.</narration></p> 

<p><narration>Emma talks with her until Jessica wipes her eyes and gives a small laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor dynamics)</notes></p> </div>
 
<p>Above, the smiles and laughs didn't happen in isolation. Instead, they're part of dynamic experiences.</p>
             
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext">  When Emma cracks a joke, the point of interest isn't so much Emma's <term>joke</term>, but Zoe's <em>change</em> from nervous to comfortable. This sort of dynamic is the focus of this book.</p>
      
      <!--
      <p class="considertext">Depsite how familiar these dynamics are, we don't always know how to talk about them. It's a bit like trying to talk about why we like a song&mdash;it can become elusive as soon as we try!</p>
      -->
</div>


<p>In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing. It's something that happens, or is felt. This isn't static&mdash;humor has a "rise and fall" element to it.</p>

<p>To understand this rise and fall, we'll have to think about <vocab>humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab>. That means thinking about changes&mdash;about  <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh, and what that <sem>does</sem> to people and situtations.   
</p>


<p>In this book, we'll learn to describe and think coherently about these humor dynamics, in ways that give us insight and capability.</p>

<p>A bit like an investigative story, we'll go over the clues from our life piece-by-piece until we assemble a satisfying way of understanding humor and the dynamic it plays in our lives.</p>


<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Beginnings.</headline> Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction in humor. Instead, it supplies catalytic insight to our lifetime of observations and experiences with humor&mdash;helping set them all into a coherent system.</p> 
       
    <p>It's a bit like geometry class. Just because  we've spent our life around rectangles and triangles doesn't mean we know everything about them.</p>
    
    <p>In the same way it's useful to understand <term>geometry</term> for some projects, some projects are helped by understand <em>humor dynamics</em>.</p>

<!--
<p>We can break things down a bit. In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing. It's something that happens, or is felt.</p> 

<p><vocab>Humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab> refers to the process that determines <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;and what that <sem>does</sem> in situations. 
</p>

<p>We can learn about these dynamics, which gives us insight and capability. It's also very interesting! In some ways, humor dynamics are the most important, and least studied subject in the world.</p>
             
              
<p>While these dynamics are as familiar to us as breathing, we don't always know how to talk about them.</p>


<div class="consider"><p class="consider">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We all notice that <term>jokes</term> sometimes make us laugh. But not everyone notices that <em>praise</em> can make us laugh too.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Should we think of these laughs seperately, or together? As we'll see, there's good reason to treat <sem>all</sem> laughing and smiling as part of the same umbrella.</p>

<p>This book is an  introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>. For most of us, this is an unfamiliar term for familiar experiences:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>We're nervous, but when someone cracks a joke we become more comfortable.</li>
    <li>We're feeling pretty neutral, but when someone compliments our work our mood jumps and we laugh easily for a while.</li>
    <li>We're crying as we talk to someone, untli we eventually smile and wipe our eyes.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Above, our smiles and laughs mark experiences of change&mdash;what this book refers to as humor dynamics. </p>
              
<p>While these dynamics are as familiar to us as breathing, we don't always know how to talk about them.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">For instance:</p>

<p><vocab>Humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab> refers to the process that determines <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;and what that <sem>does</sem> in situations.

<p>We can learn about these dynamics, which gives us insight and capability. It's also very interesting! In some ways, humor dynamics are the most important, and least studied subject in the world.</p>

    <p>
    An analogy is to geometry. Like smiles and laughs, we've spent our life around rectangles and triangles&mdash;which in some ways are simple, intuitive shapes.</p>
    
    <p>Even so, there are things to learn about them, and maybe more than we suspected at first&mdash;and learning about angles and area opens up all kinds of practical skills. We'll find that something similar happens with humor dynamics.</p>

<p>This book provides an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>: <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we laugh and smile&mdash;and what happens when we do.</p>

<p>Let's look at a few examples:</p>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
 
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
       
                           
<div class="vignette">
 
<p>
 
    <narration>Alina is talking on the phone with her younger brother, Artem.</narration></p>
 	<p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“I’m sorry things are rough right now. Lots of people have troubles after high school. There’s no shame in being depressed. Listen, I have to go, but I’ll call you soon.”</speech> <action>*hangs up*</action> 

</p>

	<p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*sits back*</action> <internalaction>(thunderstruck)</internalaction> <speech>“I have depression!?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>“That makes so much sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”</speech>
 
</p> 
    </div>
                     
<p>Above, why did Yasmin and Artem laugh? We probably have an inuitive idea about this&mdash;but this intuition can be hard to put satisfyingly into words for even one instance of humor, let alone many.</p>
                                       
<p>Similarly, we know that humor marks an inflection of some kind in a situation&mdash;but this inflection too can be hard to express with confidence.</p> 
                     

   
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

    
            
 <p>We notice these dynamics all the time. People laugh or smile after:</p>
        
<p>Have you ever smiled or laughed after:</p>
          
  <ul class="close-list">
          <li> being given a compliment</li>
           <li>hearing an insult</li>
           <li>getting hugged</li>
           <li>hearing a joke</li>
           <li>receiving a gift </li>
           <li>being kissed</li>
               <li>biking downhill</li>
           <li>coming to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>putting on clothes fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realizing you've been foolish</li>
           <li>feeling a gust of wind</li>
           <li>winning a game</li>
           <li>losing badly</li>
           <li>seeing something disgusting</li>
           <li>recalling an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
       
       <p>Of course, people don't always laugh and smile at these things&mdash;so what's going on here? What's the shared pattern between all moments of smiling and laughing? And what <sem-weak>happens</sem-weak> in a situation because of humor?</p> 
          
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">When someone compliments us and we smile, something has happened in the situation. When we crest a hill and have a scenic view and we laugh, something has happened in the situation. What is it that's happening?</p>  
             
    </div>   
                        


   <p>         We'll start by describing the pattern to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;not just for jokes, but all across our lives. As we'll come to notice, we smile and laugh all across our lives:</p>
