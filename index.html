    Welcome!
</h1>

<p>This book provides an introduction to humor dynamics&mdash;thinking about what humor is, how it works, and what it does in specific and general situations.</p>

<!--
<div class="for-instance"><p class="consider">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">What happens when you share a smile with someone? Why does laughter vary in intensity? What do moments of laughter all share? How can we describe all this in ways that feel clear and satisfying to our experiences? </p>
    </div>
	-->
					
<p>We'll learn <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile or laugh, and then be looking at what all this <sem-weak>does</sem-weak> to everyone and the overall situation.</p>
                
<p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing understanding, and producing humor than when you started.</p>

	        Photo 1 has chalk writing above a hard-to-read danger sign, so it now reads 'unreadable signs cause ... danger.'
	        
	        Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
	        
	        Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
	        
	        At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"
	        
	        title="why are things funny?">
	   
<p>But we'll be foremost talking about <sem-weak>people</sem-weak>&mdash;so we won't just be looking at <term>signs</term> themselves <callback>("why are these signs funny?")</callback>&mdash;but looking at the <em>people</em> looking at the signs. <callback>("Why would someone in particular find a sign funny?")</callback></p> 

<p>We'll then be looking at what all this <sem-weak>does</sem-weak> to everyone and to the situation.</p>

    "Humor dynamics" is a term that broadens what we're looking at. An analogy might be that humor is to flowers, what humor dynamics is to gardening&mdash;gardening is inclusive to flowers, but also about what goes into getting them, why gardens are the way they are, and so on.</p>
    
    
<p class="considertext">Humor might be to humor dynamics what flowers are to gardening&mdash;gardening is inclusive to flowers, but is also about how flowers come about and where they go and why people like certain gardens over others.</p>
