	Photo 1 has chalk writing above a hard-to-read danger sign, so it now reads 'unreadable signs cause ... danger.'
	
	Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
	
	Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
	
	At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"

<p class="faq-question">
    Q. What is The Humor Book?
</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> <i>The Humor Book</i> is a step-by-step explanation of humor.</p>

This formal explanation of humor complements our intuitive understanding of humor.

<p class="faq-question">Q. So it's about jokes?</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Not specifically—this book is about the <sem>when</sem> and <sem>why</sem> of smiling and laughing. That's sometimes inclusive to jokes, but this book isn't specifically about them.</p>

<p>While we've laughed at <term>jokes</term> before, we've <em>also</em> laughed at insults, compliments, vegetables, hugs, success, failure, cute things, gross things, and so on.</p>

<p>We'll want to explain the presence or absence of laughter in <sem>all</sem> of these cases—for jokes as well as for hugs.</p>	


<p class="faq-question">Q. Can humor really be taught?</p>

<p>
    <strong>A.</strong> <sem>Yes!</sem> There are many myths about humor—like that humor is abstract, unknowable, undefinable, unteachable, and so on. None of those are true! Usually, those statements describe the speaker more than they describe humor: <callback>"humor is unteachable (by me)."</callback>
</p>  

<p>Humor is a coherent process—so we can model it! We can use this model to describe and predict things.</p>
        
<p class="faq-question">Q. Who is this book on humor for?</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Learning about humor is interesting and useful to all kinds of people. This book helps:</p>

  <ul class="close-list">  
        <li><strong>architects</strong> and <strong>interior designers</strong> think about why some designs lead to more smiles over time than others</li>
        <li><strong>facilitators</strong> and <strong>service workers</strong> better handle conflict and create compromise</li>
        <li><strong>musicians</strong> and <strong>painters</strong> make conscious creative choices leading to smiles</li>
        <li><strong>parents</strong> and  <strong>children</strong> better understand each other</li>
        <li><strong>performers</strong> and <strong>public speakers</strong> find new perspectives on their audience</li> 
        <li><strong>researchers</strong> and <strong>historians</strong> use a coherent analytical model of humor</li>
        <li><strong>romantic partners</strong> and <strong>family members</strong> more broadly generate laughter in people they care about</li>

<p class="faq-question">Alice, historian:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“I think about <i>[The Humor Book's]</i> theory of humor all the time.”</p>

<p class="faq-question">Natalie, women’s self-defense instructor:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“Humor is important in my line of work, but you have to be careful with it. <i>The Humor Book</i> really lays out a usable guide for putting people at ease without making people uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class="faq-question">Carmel, cafe owner:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“<i>The Humor Book</i> helps in building a coherent team and reaching customers. It helps me interact with different kinds of personalities.”</p>

<p class="faq-question">Chris, surgeon:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“<i>The Humor Book</i> taught me how and why unconventional humor has a strong effect on reducing tension in critical situations. This has helped me in my practice and has made me a better surgeon instructor.”</p>

<p class="faq-question">Alex, consultant:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“It’s super interesting how this book helps me think about my [two-year-old] daughter’s sense of humor.”</p>


<p class="faq-question">Barb, bookkeeper:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">"I like <i>[The Humor Book]</i> because it's inherently human stuff—it's really the foundation, being sensitive to each other. The in-and-out, the flow of moments, and emotion and reaction—I feel it really captured it well."</p> 

<p class="faq-question">Nick, musician:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“<i>[The Humor Book]</i> really changed how I perceive music, since I see how music reaches positive humor outcomes. In the same way there’s dark humor, there’s dark music, and you can understand them similarly—why both can be enjoyable. And humor has a genre-bulldozing capability. I use [this book's] method of humor while writing music all the time."</p>

<p class="faq-question">Regan, engineer:</p>   

<p class="vig-indent">"The beautiful thing about this book is that it causes you to notice and appreciate an area of life that everyone agrees is important but receives very little formal investigation. I will be in the middle of a laugh with someone and cannot help but mentally dissect the situation with my new humor tools- which in turn makes me smile more."</p>
  
<p class="faq-question">Kayde, student:</p>
  
<p class="vig-indent">The Humor Book has given me a valuable lens through which to consider complex emotions like anger, joy, sadness, and&mdash;of course&mdash;humor. I have gained a better understanding of myself and the way I incorporate these emotions into my day-to-day interactions. After reading this book, I feel like I'm a better, more genuine communicator. </p>
