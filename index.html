                alt="This image is a composite of three different photos. Each photo shows atypical signage.
                
                Photo 1 has chalk writing above a hard-to-read danger sign, so it now reads 'unreadable signs cause ... danger.'
                
                Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
                
                Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
                
                At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"
