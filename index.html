<p class="main-title">Humor in Various Moods and Meters</p>

<p class="main-subtitle">An Introduction to Humor Dynamics</p>
<hr>

<body>  
    
    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">
Welcome!
</h1>


<p>This book is an  introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>. While this is often a new term, the dynamics of humor are as familiar to us as breathing:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>We're nervous, but someone cracks a joke and makes us laugh.</li>
    <li>A stranger compliments us and we smile and laugh easily for an hour after.</li>
    <li>We're crying as we talk to someone, but eventually we wipe our eyes and smile.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>We universally experience these moments as inflection points that define outcomes and relationships&mdash;what this book refers to as humor dynamics. </p>
              
    
<p>But while we universally notice these dynamics, we don't always know exactly how to talk about them&mdash;let alone think through them in an organized way.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Here's an example of our disorganization: if we smile because we hear a joke, and smile because we hear a compliment: are these moments of smiling and laughing different, or similar? </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We sometimes put laughs that stem from "jokes" into their own bin, and don't think much about (or ignore) the laughs everywhere else. Until it's pointed out, many of us don't even notice that people laugh when praised!
    
     <p class="considertext">As we'll see, there's good reason to treat <sem>all</sem> laughing and smiling as under the same umbrella, without worrying about whether jokes are involved or not. We'll arrive at this conclusion through some organized thinking.</p>
    </div>


<p>We can break things down a bit. In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing. It's something that happens, or is felt. 

<p><vocab>Humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab> refers to the process that determines <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;and what that <sem>does</sem> in situations. 
</p>

<p>We can learn about these dynamics, which gives us insight and capability. It's also very interesting! In some ways, humor dynamics are the most important, and least studied subject in the world.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Beginnings.</headline> Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction in humor. Instead, this book supplies catalytic insight to our lifetime of observations and experiences with humor.</p> 
       
    <p>
    An analogy is to geometry. Like smiles and laughs, we've spent our life around rectangles and triangles&mdash;which in some ways are simple, intuitive shapes.</p>
    
    <p>Even so, there are things to learn about them, and maybe more than we suspected at first&mdash;and learning about angles and area opens up all kinds of practical skills. We'll find that something similar happens with humor dynamics.</p>

    <p>We can think about our relationship to humor as similar&mdash;only our formal understanding of humor will come into play much more frequently than geometry.

<p>This book provides an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>: <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we laugh and smile&mdash;and what happens when we do.</p>

<p>Let's look at a few examples:</p>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
 
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
       
                           
<div class="vignette">
 
<p>
 
    <narration>Alina is talking on the phone with her younger brother, Artem.</narration></p>
 	<p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“I’m sorry things are rough right now. Lots of people have troubles after high school. There’s no shame in being depressed. Listen, I have to go, but I’ll call you soon.”</speech> <action>*hangs up*</action> 

</p>

	<p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*sits back*</action> <internalaction>(thunderstruck)</internalaction> <speech>“I have depression!?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>“That makes so much sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”</speech>
 
</p> 
    </div>
                     
<p>Above, why did Yasmin and Artem laugh? We probably have an inuitive idea about this&mdash;but this intuition can be hard to put satisfyingly into words for even one instance of humor, let alone many.</p>
                                       
<p>Similarly, we know that humor marks an inflection of some kind in a situation&mdash;but this inflection too can be hard to express with confidence.</p> 
                     

   
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

    
            
 <p>We notice these dynamics all the time. People laugh or smile after:</p>
        
<p>Have you ever smiled or laughed after:</p>
          
  <ul class="close-list">
          <li> being given a compliment</li>
           <li>hearing an insult</li>
           <li>getting hugged</li>
           <li>hearing a joke</li>
           <li>receiving a gift </li>
           <li>being kissed</li>
               <li>biking downhill</li>
           <li>coming to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>putting on clothes fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realizing you've been foolish</li>
           <li>feeling a gust of wind</li>
           <li>winning a game</li>
           <li>losing badly</li>
           <li>seeing something disgusting</li>
           <li>recalling an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
       
       <p>Of course, people don't always laugh and smile at these things&mdash;so what's going on here? What's the shared pattern between all moments of smiling and laughing? And what <sem-weak>happens</sem-weak> in a situation because of humor?</p> 
          
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">When someone compliments us and we smile, something has happened in the situation. When we crest a hill and have a scenic view and we laugh, something has happened in the situation. What is it that's happening?</p>  
             
    </div>   
                        


   <p>         We'll start by describing the pattern to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;not just for jokes, but all across our lives. As we'll come to notice, we smile and laugh all across our lives:</p>
