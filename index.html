<p class="main-title">Humor in Various Moods and Meters</p>

<p class="main-subtitle">An Introduction to Humor Dynamics</p>
<hr>

<body>  
    
    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">
Welcome!
</h1>


<p>This book is an  introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>. While "humor dynamics" is often a new term to us, these dynamics are as familiar to us as breathing:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>We're nervous&mdash;but someone cracks a joke and makes us laugh.</li>
    <li>A stranger compliments us&mdash;and we smile and laugh easily for an hour after.</li>
    <li>We talk to someone and start crying&mdash;but eventually we wipe our eyes and smile.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>These moments of smiling and laughing are inflection points that define outcomes and relationships&mdash;what this book refers to as humor dynamics. </p>
              
    
<p>But while we universally <term>notice</term> these dynamics, we don't always know how to <em>talk</em> about them&mdash;let alone think through them in an organized way.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Let's say we laugh because we're told a <term>joke</term>&mdash;and later laugh because we're <em>complimented</em>. Are these moments of laughing different, or similar?</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">If we're unsure of the relationship between jokes, compliments, and laughs, we have some careful thinking to do to make sense of what, exactly, is going on here.</p>
     
     <p class="considertext">One part of this is <sem>noticing</sem> where we actually laugh. Until it's pointed out, many of us haven't noticed that we laugh when complimented&mdash;or that, for the vast majority of us, we make others laugh more often through compliments than we do through jokes.
    </div>


<p>We can break things down a bit. In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing. "Humor" is something that happens, or is felt:</p> 

      <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>


<p><vocab>Humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab> refers to the process that determines <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;and what that <sem>does</sem> in situations.</p> 

    <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;why does Yasmin laugh? Why does she stop laughing? Why did she laugh as hard as she did, and not harder? Why would someone laugh seeing Yasmin laugh? Why would she eventually <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> laugh when putting her glasses on? What can we infer about Yasmin from this laugh? What does this humor "mean"? And so on)</notes>
     </p>
</div>

<p>We'll be taking a systemic approach to humor, taking its dynamics are fundamentally understandable. We'll be learning about these dynamics step-by-step throughout this book.</p> 

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Even though we all smile and laugh, a formal study of humor is still important! A good analogy is to geometry. Rectangles and triangles are familiar, intuitive shapes&mdash;which is true even as a good geometry class opens up all kinds of practical skills by guiding us through explicit ideas about angles and area.</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">Extending the metaphor, we may also find that, while we can intuitively work through rectangles well enough, a lack of formal geometry leaves us unequipped to deal with quadrilaterals&mdash;and we sometimes just don't think about them at all because of that.</p>
     
     <p class="considertext">We'll find something similar with humor, where smiling and laughter are in many ways intuitive&mdash;which can still be true even as a good formal study opens up all kinds of useful and interesting things, often that take us deeper into things than we suspected at the outset.</p>
     

    </div>
<p>For many of us, this will be a fresh approach to smiles and laughter, 

  giving us increased insight and ability&mdash;which will have ramifications all across our lives.</p>


Various Moods and Meters. This book is about humor in all seasons.

 The boy who demanded his science teacher start with tadpoles because that was what interested him. 


<div class="box"><p><headline>Alchemy of Happiness.</headline> Humor dynamics are the most important,  least studied subject in the world. It's likely you were given several math textbooks in high school&mdash;but zero on humor!</p> 

<p>It's left many of us with a puzzling relation to our experiences. We grew up describing our sense of humor as weird, or were hurt by being mocked. We felt compelled to do things to try to make others laugh&mdash;we were drawn to places that make us smile&mdash;we laughed with everyone else even when someone was being harmed&mdash;we laughed when we cried and sometimes laughed when others cried.</p> 
 
<p>More fundamentally, we felt connected or alienated based on the smiles and laughs around us, but never really clearly understood this dynamic due to apparent incoherence. This book untangles our experiences so that we can make sense of all this, and apply that understanding elegantly and productively.</p> 
  
 <p>For humor, this might have led to give-up ideas that we wouldn't tolerate elsewhere <callback>("humor is unknowable")</callback> or ideas from entertainers or literary theorists that have limited relevance to our day-to-day life.</p>

<p>This book provides a survey of the humor dynamics that happen in daily life, between people&mdash;like how and why humor is involved in making and keeping friends, and how we can understand how people are experiencing the world around them.</p>

    <p><headline>Beginnings.</headline> Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction in humor. Instead, it supplies catalytic insight to our lifetime of observations and experiences with smiling and laughing.</p> 
       
        
        
    <p>An analogy is to geometry. We spent our life around rectangles and triangles, which in some ways are simple, intuitive shapes. Even so, some catalytic insight to angles and area opens up all kinds of practical skills.</p>
    
    <p>We can think about our relationship to humor as similar&mdash;only our formal understanding of humor will come into play much more frequently than geometry.

<p>This book provides an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>: <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we laugh and smile&mdash;and what happens when we do.</p>

<p>Let's look at a few examples:</p>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
 
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
       
                           
<div class="vignette">
 
<p>
 
    <narration>Alina is talking on the phone with her younger brother, Artem.</narration></p>
 	<p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“I’m sorry things are rough right now. Lots of people have troubles after high school. There’s no shame in being depressed. Listen, I have to go, but I’ll call you soon.”</speech> <action>*hangs up*</action> 

</p>

	<p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*sits back*</action> <internalaction>(thunderstruck)</internalaction> <speech>“I have depression!?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>“That makes so much sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”</speech>
 
</p> 
    </div>
                     
<p>Above, why did Yasmin and Artem laugh? We probably have an inuitive idea about this&mdash;but this intuition can be hard to put satisfyingly into words for even one instance of humor, let alone many.</p>
                                       
<p>Similarly, we know that humor marks an inflection of some kind in a situation&mdash;but this inflection too can be hard to express with confidence.</p> 
                     

   
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

    
            
 <p>We notice these dynamics all the time. People laugh or smile after:</p>
        
<p>Have you ever smiled or laughed after:</p>
          
  <ul class="close-list">
          <li> being given a compliment</li>
           <li>hearing an insult</li>
           <li>getting hugged</li>
           <li>hearing a joke</li>
           <li>receiving a gift </li>
           <li>being kissed</li>
               <li>biking downhill</li>
           <li>coming to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>putting on clothes fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realizing you've been foolish</li>
           <li>feeling a gust of wind</li>
           <li>winning a game</li>
           <li>losing badly</li>
           <li>seeing something disgusting</li>
           <li>recalling an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
       
       <p>Of course, people don't always laugh and smile at these things&mdash;so what's going on here? What's the shared pattern between all moments of smiling and laughing? And what <sem-weak>happens</sem-weak> in a situation because of humor?</p> 
          
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">When someone compliments us and we smile, something has happened in the situation. When we crest a hill and have a scenic view and we laugh, something has happened in the situation. What is it that's happening?</p>  
             
    </div>   
                        


   <p>         We'll start by describing the pattern to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;not just for jokes, but all across our lives. As we'll come to notice, we smile and laugh all across our lives:</p>
