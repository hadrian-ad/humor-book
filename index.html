<p>Welcome! In this book, you'll learn to observe and think more effectively about humor&mdash;and by doing so, you'll join the parents, teachers, engineers, surgeons, artists, farmers, and more who have read this book.</p>

<!--
<p>What does one get when one stacks their odious pamphlets and other wretched miselannia too high? Their own death, it seems, as happened to the neurotic Hadrian DeMaioribus, who was found crushed under his own printed detritus when the stacks tipped over on him, also knocking over his buckets set up around room to catch the leaks in his ceiling, the spilled water catching the live wires carelessly strewn about and eletrifying him with the other rodents and cockroaches of his hovel.</p>

<p>
    The surprise of this book was that it was written at all&mdash;that a man of such unseemly temper and aggrandization as Hadrian&mdash;who used to yell at me at me before, during, and after class&mdash;could produce a text as lucid and genre-defining <book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> at all.
</p> 

A classic in its field, it has reached it's third edition.

<div class="about-box">
<p>There's is a textbook on humor&mdash;a resource that's accessible, clear, coherent, practical, and straightforward. </p></div>



<p>Welcome to <book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title>! As you've probably noticed&mdash;there's something about humor that's hard to put into words. </p>


<p>This gets into the majestic willfulness of smiling and laughing, and the secretive flittering of what it all means. This is what we'll be trying to capture&mdash;gently, concretely&mdash;in this book.</p>

<p>Long long ago, I was the sort of person who wrote down jokes in a little notebooks. There's the caticlism</p>

<p>I remember when I was six, and my arm got trapped under a treadmill, shredding my skin. My dad, as he always could when I cried, made me laugh.</p>

<p>Of course, my dad would always laugh when he watched people get hurt&mdash;but not <sem-weak>meanly</sem-weak> laugh, exactly.</p> 



<p>Partly it's the <term>breadth</term> of situations they occur in&mdash;and their <term2>variety</term2>. 

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">Growing up, my dad illustrated to me all the perplexities around smiling and laughing.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">He rarely laughed at animated comedies, but often chuckled when people got hurt&mdash;not meanly, exactly. And he could unfailingly make me laugh and feel better when I got hurt as a child.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext"></p>
</div>

<p>This book is about <vocab>humor</vocab>.</p> 

<p>Before looking at humor more specifically, we can look at some examples of the kinds of things we'll be looking at:</p>

 
 
 <!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
     
    <p class="considertext">Most people take a class on geometry&mdash;but few people take a class on smiling and laughing!</p>

<div class="vignette">

<p><narration>Sam says something that makes Riley giggle, despite herself.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p></div>
 
<p>Above, we're focusing on the smiling and laughing&mdash;and their role in dynamic experiences.</p>
             
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext">  When Emma cracks a joke, the point of interest isn't so much Emma's <term>joke</term>, but Zoe's <term2>change</term2> from nervous to comfortable. This sort of dynamic is the focus of this book.</p>
            
      
      <!--
      <p class="considertext">Depsite how familiar these dynamics are, we don't always know how to talk about them. It's a bit like trying to talk about why we like a song&mdash;it can become elusive as soon as we try!</p>
      -->
</div>

<p>These dynamics around humor are intimately familiar. Depsite this, we often find them hard to think through. Why are things funny? What do smiles mean? 
</p>
    
    <!--

    <p>When we stop to notice it, we smile and laugh all the time, like when we:</p>
    
              
   <ul class="close-list">
          <li> are given a compliment</li>
           <li>are insulted</li>
           <li>are hugged</li>
           <li>hear a joke</li>
           <li>receive a gift </li>
           <li>are kissed</li>
               <li>bike downhill</li>
           <li>come to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>put clothes on fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realize we've been foolish</li>
           <li>are pressured successfully</li>
           <li>feel a gust of wind</li>
           <li>finish a workout</li>
           <li>see a fox</li>
           <li>win a game</li>
           <li>lose badly</li>
           <li>enter a beautiful room</li>
           <li>see something disgusting</li>
           <li>recall an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
 
<p>To make matters more confusing, we sometimes <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> laugh at these things&mdash;or laugh at their opposites!</p>

<p>In this book, we'll call all these experiences of laughing and smiling <vocab>humor</vocab>&mdash;and explain it all through the same system, whether dynamically related to jokes, misfortune, praise, and so on.</p>
-->

<p>In this book, we'll learn to describe and understand these experiences around smiling and laughing. This will make us more capable in our ability to generate and understand smiles and laughs&mdash;and let us uncover some surprising, important insights.</p>


    
<div class="box">
        
        <p><headline>Everywhere.</headline> Everyone has a lifetime of experiences with humor. This book takes a careful look at those experiences, and gives catalytic insight to organize those experiences in a coherent system.</p>
        
        <p>This means taking into account the humor that happens all across our lives&mdash;when aroused, bitter, confused, frustrated, joyful, sad, triumphant, and so on. <book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> explains this variety through the same system.

    <p class="considertext">Not only is "eating" much broader than burgers&mdash;we don't <sem-weak>have</sem-weak> to eat burgers. Focusing on burgers to explain eating would not necessarily be the best approach, and maybe even lead to problems.</p>

<p>In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing. It's something that happens, or is felt. This isn't static&mdash;humor has a "rise and fall" element to it.</p>

<p>To understand this rise and fall, we'll have to think about <vocab>humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab>. That means thinking about changes&mdash;about  <term>when</term> and <term2>why</term2> we smile and laugh, and what that <em>does</em> to people and situtations.

<p>This book is an  introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>. For most of us, this is an unfamiliar term for familiar experiences:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>We're nervous, but when someone cracks a joke we become more comfortable.</li>
    <li>We're feeling pretty neutral, but when someone compliments our work our mood jumps and we laugh easily for a while.</li>
    <li>We're crying as we talk to someone, untli we eventually smile and wipe our eyes.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Above, our smiles and laughs mark experiences of change&mdash;what this book refers to as humor dynamics. </p>
              
<p>While these dynamics are as familiar to us as breathing, we don't always know how to talk about them.</p>

<p>This book provides an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>: <term>when</term> and <term2>why</term2> we laugh and smile&mdash;and what happens when we do.</p>

<p>Let's look at a few examples:</p>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
 
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
       
                           
<div class="vignette">
 
<p>
 
    <narration>Alina is talking on the phone with her younger brother, Artem.</narration></p>
 	<p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“I’m sorry things are rough right now. Lots of people have troubles after high school. There’s no shame in being depressed. Listen, I have to go, but I’ll call you soon.”</speech> <action>*hangs up*</action> 

</p>

	<p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*sits back*</action> <internalaction>(thunderstruck)</internalaction> <speech>“I have depression!?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>“That makes so much sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”</speech>
 
</p> 
    </div>
                     
<p>Above, why did Yasmin and Artem laugh? We probably have an inuitive idea about this&mdash;but this intuition can be hard to put satisfyingly into words for even one instance of humor, let alone many.</p>
                                       
<p>Similarly, we know that humor marks an inflection of some kind in a situation&mdash;but this inflection too can be hard to express with confidence.</p> 
                     

   
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

    
            
 <p>We notice these dynamics all the time. People laugh or smile after:</p>
        
<p>Have you ever smiled or laughed after:</p>
          
  <ul class="close-list">
          <li> being given a compliment</li>
           <li>hearing an insult</li>
           <li>getting hugged</li>
           <li>hearing a joke</li>
           <li>receiving a gift </li>
           <li>being kissed</li>
               <li>biking downhill</li>
           <li>coming to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>putting on clothes fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realizing you've been foolish</li>
           <li>feeling a gust of wind</li>
           <li>winning a game</li>
           <li>losing badly</li>
           <li>seeing something disgusting</li>
           <li>recalling an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
       
       <p>Of course, people don't always laugh and smile at these things&mdash;so what's going on here? What's the shared pattern between all moments of smiling and laughing? And what <sem-weak>happens</sem-weak> in a situation because of humor?</p> 
          
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">When someone compliments us and we smile, something has happened in the situation. When we crest a hill and have a scenic view and we laugh, something has happened in the situation. What is it that's happening?</p>  
             
    </div>   
                        


   <p>         We'll start by describing the pattern to <term>when</term> and <term2>why</term2> we smile and laugh&mdash;not just for jokes, but all across our lives. As we'll come to notice, we smile and laugh all across our lives:</p>
