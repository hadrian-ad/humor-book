<p>Why is there humor in the examples above? We'll learn to think fluently about this, step-by-step.</p>

<p>Our starting step will be to learn a <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> for humor.</p>

<p><i>Humor in Various Moods and Meter</i> provides a gentle slope to learning the system of smiles and laughs&mdash;what this book calls humor.</p>

    <p>Of course, knowing why someone does or doesn't laugh is just the beginning&mdash;it simply cracks the door to the very interesting world of <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>.</p>

        We can understand "humor dynamics" with an analogy: what's the difference between studying garden <term>flowers</term> and studying <em>gardening</em>?</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">Partly, it's a matter of scope&mdash;when we study <sem-weak>gardening</sem-weak>, we're not just focused on flowers, but on the system in which flowers sometimes do or don't happen.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">
        This is similar for <sem-weak>humor dynamics</sem-weak>, which is an awareness of the system that produces (or doesn't produce) smiles or laughter, and how and why we are effected by or engage with this system.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>This book isn't about jokes, but about something much broader in scope. After all, we laugh (or don't laugh) after:</p>
    
      a good hug
      a direct truth 
      a delicious meal
      finally giving up
      being scared
      
      
      It's these various moods and meters that this book will be trying to understand, all at once, through the same ideas.</p>

<p>By the end, you'll have become significantly better at observing, describing, understanding, and producing humor than you were before.</p>
