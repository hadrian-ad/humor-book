<p class="main-title">Humor in Various Moods and Meters</p>

<p class="main-subtitle">An Introduction to Humor Dynamics</p>
<hr>

<body>  
    
    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">
Welcome!
</h1>


<p>This book is an  introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>

    <p class="considertext">While the term "humor dynamics" is often new, our experiences with them are not. Whenever people smile or laugh, we know it's an inflection point in the situation&mdash;a moment that helps define outcomes or relationships.</p>
                
</div>


<p>We can break this down a bit. In this book, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to smiling and laughing. <vocab>Humor <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak></vocab> refers to the process that determines <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;and what that does in situations. 
</p>

<p>By understanding humor dynamics, we'll gain insight and capability.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Beginnings.</headline> Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction in humor. Instead, this book supplies catalytic insight to our lifetime of observations and experiences with humor.</p> 
       
    <p>
    An analogy is to geometry. Like smiles and laughs, we've spent our life around rectangles and triangles&mdash;which in some ways are simple, intuitive shapes.</p>
    
    <p>Even so, there are things to learn about them, and maybe more than we suspected at first&mdash;and learning about angles and area opens up all kinds of practical skills. We'll find that something similar happens with humor dynamics.</p>

    <p>We can think about our relationship to humor as similar&mdash;only our formal understanding of humor will come into play much more frequently than geometry.

<p>This book provides an introduction to <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>: <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we laugh and smile&mdash;and what happens when we do.</p>

<p>Let's look at a few examples:</p>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
 
        <narration>Yasmin puts on her glasses for the first time. She can see leaves! Clouds have texture! She beams and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>
     </p>
</div>
       
                           
<div class="vignette">
 
<p>
 
    <narration>Alina is talking on the phone with her younger brother, Artem.</narration></p>
 	<p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“I’m sorry things are rough right now. Lots of people have troubles after high school. There’s no shame in being depressed. Listen, I have to go, but I’ll call you soon.”</speech> <action>*hangs up*</action> 

</p>

	<p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*sits back*</action> <internalaction>(thunderstruck)</internalaction> <speech>“I have depression!?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <speech>“That makes so much sense. Why didn’t I think of that before?”</speech>
 
</p> 
    </div>
                     
<p>Above, why did Yasmin and Artem laugh? We probably have an inuitive idea about this&mdash;but this intuition can be hard to put satisfyingly into words for even one instance of humor, let alone many.</p>
                                       
<p>Similarly, we know that humor marks an inflection of some kind in a situation&mdash;but this inflection too can be hard to express with confidence.</p> 
                     

   
    <p>We'll be going over these humor dynamics carefully and in a systematic way. By the time we finish, you'll be better at observing, describing, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

    
            
 <p>We notice these dynamics all the time. People laugh or smile after:</p>
        
<p>Have you ever smiled or laughed after:</p>
          
  <ul class="close-list">
          <li> being given a compliment</li>
           <li>hearing an insult</li>
           <li>getting hugged</li>
           <li>hearing a joke</li>
           <li>receiving a gift </li>
           <li>being kissed</li>
               <li>biking downhill</li>
           <li>coming to a scenic overlook</li>
           <li>putting on clothes fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>realizing you've been foolish</li>
           <li>feeling a gust of wind</li>
           <li>winning a game</li>
           <li>losing badly</li>
           <li>seeing something disgusting</li>
           <li>recalling an embarrassing memory</li></ul>
       
      <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
       
       <p>Of course, people don't always laugh and smile at these things&mdash;so what's going on here? What's the shared pattern between all moments of smiling and laughing? And what <sem-weak>happens</sem-weak> in a situation because of humor?</p> 
          
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">When someone compliments us and we smile, something has happened in the situation. When we crest a hill and have a scenic view and we laugh, something has happened in the situation. What is it that's happening?</p>  
             
    </div>   
                        


   <p>         We'll start by describing the pattern to <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we smile and laugh&mdash;not just for jokes, but all across our lives. As we'll come to notice, we smile and laugh all across our lives:</p>
