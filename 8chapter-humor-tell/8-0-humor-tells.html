Humor tells
</h1>


<p>In previous chapters, we’ve said humor is an emotion. In this chapter, we’ll be looking more specifically at what this means. What does it mean to feel or experience humor?</p> 

<p>To start, we’ll look at “humor tells.” When enough humor tells occur together, they compose humor.</p>

Humor tells

brightening

energy

expansive posture

eyes twinkling

flushing

higher speaking register

informal posture

informal movement

laughter

loosening

reduction of physical tension

relaxed posture

smiling

touching others

touching self

efforts to spread humor

fast thinking

fast speaking

louder voice

focusing on present

high energy

increased agency

loss of situational awareness

non-normative behavior

optimism

raised spirits

reduction of stress

social integration

social seeking

social tightening

(and so on)


“Humor” and “humor tells” are the same thing: when we experience humor, these humor tells occur in clusters—and when humor tells occur in clusters, we experience humor.

Above, the man brightens, smiles, has energy, informal posture, optimism, raised spirits, relaxed posture, lost situational awareness, is touching self, focusing on present, social seeking (looking at someone), and so on. These are all humor tells. 

Since there are so many humor tells occurring at once, we know the man is experiencing humor. 





Variations. Each humor tell refers to a wide range of behavior. For instance, touching self might refer to someone: 
leaning forward and putting their elbows on their thighs
leaning back and clasping their hands above their belly
putting a hand on their chin
putting a hand on their forehead
covering their face
crossing their arms or legs
clapping their hands
slapping their thigh
playing with their hair
 (and so on) 

Often, humor tells are shaped by circumstances. For instance, social seeking might mean sharing a glance—but it may also mean excitedly pulling out our phone to text someone (social seeking) or running into the other room to find someone (also social seeking).

Since humor tells are so varied, our general list isn’t exhaustive or official—it’s just an observational starting point.
