We can annotate our examples with humor tells
</h1>

<p>We previously used examples of humor family words and said they were  <emotions>humor</emotions>. We can use humor tells to describe what this humor looked like:</p>

<h2>Reconciliation</h2>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*keeps typing*</action> <speech>“Yeah, well. Thanks. I appreciate that. And, you know, on my end, sometimes people have told me… I lack tact.”</speech></p>

Let’s not overdo it there.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>social integrating</humor-tell>)</notes></p>
    </div>


<h2>Achievement</h2>
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Lina gets an email that her college decision notification is ready. Her blood freezes. Heart pounding, she logs on to her account and clicks the ‘view decision update’ letter. Her mouth is dry while it loads.</narration> <speech>“Congratulations!”</speech> <narration>the letter says.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Lina leaps up and pumps her fist.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell>)</notes> <speech>“Mom, mom!”</speech> <narration>she yells, thumping down the stairs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>seeking others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>louder voice</humor-tell>)</notes> <speech>“I got into Pitt!”</speech> <narration>She jumps up and down and dances, glowing with happiness.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>attempting to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>flushing</humor-tell>)</notes> <narration>As her mom congratulates her, she puts on a celebratory plastic tiara, feeling invincibly happy.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>)</notes> <narration>They head out to get pizza, and she catches her reflection of the doors of the pizza place, and laughs as she examines herself.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>optimism</humor-tell>)</notes> <narration>She spends the rest of the evening joking with her mom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>effort to spread humor</humor-tell>)</notes></p>

    <h2>Safety</h2>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin are watching Squeal III. A teenager explores an old mansion at night, and paused before a small jewelry box ominously on the table.</narration> <speech>“Don’t do it,”</speech> <narration>Trevor says, annoyed. The teenager slowly opens the box and a ragged ghost explodes out!</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin leap up.</narration> <speech>“Fuck!!”</speech> <narration>Yasmin says, heart thumping. She laughs, hand over her heart.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin <humor-tell>laughs</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touches self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosens</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxes</humor-tell>, and so on)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Trevor has his hands on his head.</narration> <speech>“Why can’t they just have the monsters and blood without the freaking jump scares?”</speech> <narration>he says.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor <humor-tell>touches self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seeks</humor-tell>)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>Humor tells help us spot when people are feeling humor family words. We show humor tells when we feel <emotions>safety</emotions> after a jump scare, <emotions>achievement</emotions> after a success, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> after an apology, and so on.</p>


<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Absence of humor tells</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>Trevor didn’t show many humor tells after the jump scare—because he wasn’t really feeling much <emotions>safety</emotions>! Trevor mostly shows inverse humor tell:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>instead of <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell>tightens</emotion-tell></li>
    <li>instead of <humor-tell>feeling optimism</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell>feels dread</emotion-tell></li>
    <li>instead of <humor-tell>flushing</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell>pales</emotion-tell></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and so on">(and so on)</p>

<p>While Trevor also shows a few humor tells, like <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>, these are also anxiety tells or fear tells. Emotion tells often count for more than one emotion—which means social seeking can double count as both a humor tell and discomfort tell.</p>

<p>In this case, we’d say Trevor has <em>some</em> humor in his emotional state after the jump scare—but that he’s <em>mostly</em> feeling discomfort or irritation.</p>

    <div class="content">

<p>Humor is composed of clusters of co-occuring reaction elements called humor tells. These humor tells make up a pattern definition of humor.</p> 

<ul>
   <li>We'll use a <a href="8-0-humor-tells.html#exclude-navigation"><strong>specific list</strong></a> of humor tells in this book: <i>brightening, energy, expansive posture, eyes twinkling, flushing, higher speaking register, informal posture, informal movement, laughter, loosening, reduction of physical tension, relaxed posture, smiling, touching others, touching self, efforts to spread humor, fast thinking, fast speaking, louder voice, focusing on present, high energy, increased agency, loss of situational awareness, non-normative behavior, optimism, raised spirits, reduction of stress, social integration, social seeking,</i> and <i>social tightening</i>.</li>
    
    <li><i>Humor tells = humor = humor family words.</i> These are all different ways of looking at the same thing—which is why they all carry humor qualities like <a href="8-3-humor-tell-change-over-time-to-express-change-in-intensity.html#exclude-navigation"><strong>intensity and duration</strong></a>, and each help us notice and describe low-intensity humor.</li>
    
    <li>Humor tells combine with other emotion tells to make up our <a href="8-5-humor-tells-are-expressed-in-many-different-ways.html#exclude-navigation"><strong>emotional state</strong></a>. For instance, humor tells and anger tells together mean we have humor and anger simultaneously in our emotional state.</li>
    
    </ul>
