We can annotate our examples with humor tells
</h1>

<p>We previously used examples of humor family words and said they were  <emotions>humor</emotions>. We can use humor tells to describe what this humor looked like:</p>

<h2>Reconciliation</h2>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*keeps typing*</action> <speech>“Yeah, well. Thanks. I appreciate that. And, you know, on my end, sometimes people have told me… I lack tact.”</speech></p>

Let’s not overdo it there.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>social integrating</humor-tell>)</notes></p>
    </div>


<h2>Achievement</h2>
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Lina gets an email that her college decision notification is ready. Her blood freezes. Heart pounding, she logs on to her account and clicks the ‘view decision update’ letter. Her mouth is dry while it loads.</narration> <speech>“Congratulations!”</speech> <narration>the letter says.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Lina leaps up and pumps her fist.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell>)</notes> <speech>“Mom, mom!”</speech> <narration>she yells, thumping down the stairs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>seeking others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>louder voice</humor-tell>)</notes> <speech>“I got into Pitt!”</speech> <narration>She jumps up and down and dances, glowing with happiness.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>attempting to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>flushing</humor-tell>)</notes> <narration>As her mom congratulates her, she puts on a celebratory plastic tiara, feeling invincibly happy.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>)</notes> <narration>They head out to get pizza, and she catches her reflection of the doors of the pizza place, and laughs as she examines herself.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>optimism</humor-tell>)</notes> <narration>She spends the rest of the evening joking with her mom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<humor-tell>effort to spread humor</humor-tell>)</notes></p>
    
    </div>
    
    <h2>Safety</h2>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin are watching Squeal III. A teenager explores an old mansion at night, and paused before a small jewelry box ominously on the table.</narration> <speech>“Don’t do it,”</speech> <narration>Trevor says, annoyed. The teenager slowly opens the box and a ragged ghost explodes out!</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin leap up.</narration> <speech>“Fuck!!”</speech> <narration>Yasmin says, heart thumping. She laughs, hand over her heart.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin <humor-tell>laughs</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touches self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosens</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxes</humor-tell>)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Trevor has his hands on his head.</narration> <speech>“Why can’t they just have the monsters and blood without the freaking jump scares?”</speech> <narration>he says.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor <humor-tell>touches self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seeks</humor-tell>)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>Humor tells help us spot when people are feeling humor family words. We show humor tells when we feel <emotions>safety</emotions> after a jump scare, <emotions>achievement</emotions> after a success, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> after an apology, and so on.</p>


    <div class="box">
<p><headline>Absence.</headline> Trevor didn’t show many humor tells after the jump scare—because he wasn’t really feeling much <emotions>safety</emotions>! Trevor mostly shows inverse humor tell:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>instead of <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>tightens</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell></li>
    <li>instead of <humor-tell>feeling optimism</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>feels dread</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell></li>
    <li>instead of <humor-tell>flushing</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>pales</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>While Trevor also shows a few humor tells, like <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>, these are also anxiety tells or fear tells. Emotion tells often count for more than one emotion—which means <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> can double count as both a humor tell and mistake-predominance tell.</p>

<p>In this case, we’d say Trevor has <term>some</term> humor in his emotional state after the jump scare—but that he’s <em>mostly</em> feeling discomfort or irritation.</p>

    A deeper look (Pattern definitions)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">

<p>One way we define things is through <vocab>pattern definitions</vocab>. Pattern definitions are much closer to how we actually define things than dictionary definitions—pattern definitions are why we can drive past ten barns and recognize them each as a “barn,” even though none of them look exactly alike.</p> 

<p>To see how pattern definitions works, we can make a simple pattern definition for a barn. We’ll start by making a list of things we understand to be possible elements of barns:</p> 

<div class="list-in-text">
    <p><strong>Elements of our pattern definition:</strong></p>
    
    <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
       <li>silo</li>
        <li>big double doors</li>
        <li>stand alone structure</li>
        <li>red</li>
        <li>winch</li>
        <li>fodder</li>
        <li>made of wood</li>
        <li>gambrel roof</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
</div>

<p>Then, we assign weight to each element of a barn, since some things are more important to what a barn “is” than others. So we'll assign points for “barnness:”</p>

<div class="list-in-text">
    <p><strong>Elements of our pattern definition:</strong></p>
    
    <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
        <li>
            silo (10) <notes>(&larr;ten points toward “barnness”)</notes>
        </li>
        <li>big double doors (5)</li>
        <li>stand alone structure (3)</li>
        <li>red (2)</li>
        <li>winch (5)</li>
        <li>fodder (3)</li>
        <li>made of wood (2)</li>
        <li>gambrel roof (5)</li>
    </ul>
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
</div>

<p>The final piece of a pattern definition is to set a point threshold for what we identify as a barn. Let’s say 15 points is the threshold where we tag a structure as being a barn. Now, if we come across three very different buildings, we’ll be able to classify each one as barn or not-barn: </p> 

<div class="list-in-text"><p><strong>Structure #1</strong></p>
    
    <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
       <li>silo (10)</li>
        <li>winch (5)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p style="margin-left: 4rem; font-size: medium">= 15 points of barnness = “it’s a barn!”</p> </div>

<div class="list-in-text"><p><strong>Structure #2</strong></p>
    
    <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
       <li>stand alone structure (3)</li>
        <li>red (2)</li>
        <li>big double doors (5)</li>
        <li>fodder (2)</li>
        <li>made of wood (3)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p style="margin-left: 4rem; font-size: medium">= 15 points of barnness = “it’s a barn!”</p> </div>         

<div class="list-in-text">
    <p><strong>Structure #3</strong></p>
    
    <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
       <li>stand alone structure (3)</li>
        
        <li>made of wood (3)</li>
        
        <li>gambrel roof (5)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p style="margin-left: 4rem; font-size: medium">= 11 points of barnness = “well it’s barn-<i>like…</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>When we combine dozens of pattern definitions for different structures, we have a flexible system for identification and classification. We’ll have patterns in our head for barns, houses, monasteries, outhouses, sheds, warehouses, and so on—which we can mix and match to describe even buildings that are unique in all the world. <callback>(“Well, it looks like a mix between a barn and a… monastery?”)</callback></p>

<p>There’s no official cosmic pattern definition for something like a barn. They’re just definitions we make up ourselves, out of everything we know about them. This means these pattern definitions vary person-by-person, based on our experiences.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Someone who grew up in 21st century Japan would have a different pattern definition for “barn” than someone who grew up in 14th century France. Similarly, someone who lived in a city would have a different pattern definition for barn someone who uses or researches barns daily.</p>
</div>

<p>The pattern definition we casually made above is just based on the barns we see in children’s books and stock photos—it's probably not a very good pattern definition for most practical purposes. As we gain more awareness about barns, we’d update and refine our definition.</p> 

<p>In this chapter, we’ve been making a pattern definition of <sem>humor</sem>:</p>

 <p><strong>Elements of our pattern definition:</strong></p>

<div class="list-in-text"><ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
       <li>laughter (10)</li>
        
        <li>smiling (5)</li>
        
        <li>brightening (3)</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    </div>
<p>We have a set of possible reaction elements, and we can decide which of these reaction elements are part of the humor pattern and which are part of other emotional patterns. This lets us take an emotional state that’s unique in all the world and try to make sense of whether it has what we’ve patterned as “humor” in it.</p>

<p>This is why we can see a thousand people feel humor a thousand times each, and still recognize it all as humor—even though none of those million moments of humor are exactly alike. It’s for the same reason we can recognize a thousand different structures as barns, even if none of them are exactly alike!</p>

<p>We can use pattern definitions to think about what emotions are. We take the set of possible human reaction elements <callback>(“emotion tells”)</callback>, and see which ones co-occur in distinguishable relationships. We give names to these patterns, like <emotions>sadness</emotions> or <emotions>anger</emotions>. But it’s important to notice that there isn’t an "official" definition to an emotion like <emotions>anger</emotions>, since there are so many ways to tweak our pattern definition of it.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Maybe the convention fifty years ago was that anger required 25 points to be “anger”—but today the word anger only requires 15 points. Maybe a hundred years ago, blasphemous cursing was 15 points toward anger, but today is usually only 5 points toward anger.</p>

<p class="for-instance-text">Maybe one language has a very broad pattern for <emotions>anger</emotions> but another language splits this pattern up into two emotions. Maybe another language doesn't have a word for <emotions>anger</emotions> and uses a word like <emotions>hurt</emotions> instead.</p>
</div> 


<p>We're using a specific pattern definition for humor in this book that's broader than is often conventional. While many conventional pattern definitions of humor focus on high-intensity humor, like belly laughing—we want our pattern definition to include our experiences with low-intensities of humor too. <callback>("A single exhale making up a very soft laugh.")</callback></p>

<p>We can also use pattern definitions to think about why humor family words are humor—even though we can somewhat distinguish between experiences of <emotions>achievement</emotions> and <emotions>generosity</emotions>.</p> 

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li>
        <p>First, humor family words are themselves pattern definitions that sit <sem-weak>within</sem-weak> a broader pattern pattern of humor—similar to how <emotions>irritability</emotions> and <emotions>frustration</emotions> are specific patterns within a broader pattern of anger.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <p>Secondly, a pattern definition for the word <term>humor</term> tends to <term>exclude</term> context—while <em>humor family words</em> explicitly <em>include</em> context as part of its pattern definition.</p>
    </li>
</ul>



<p>As we’ll see throughout this book, the pattern definition our model of humor uses will let us talk about ourselves and the world in some interesting ways—and let us think pragmatically about some of the underlying systems that make up our experiences.</p>

<p>The word "humor" refers to a pattern definition of reaction elements. When clusters of these reaction elements co-occur, we label it as humor.

<ul>
   <li>We'll use a <a href="8-0-humor-tells.html#exclude-navigation">specific list</a> of humor tells in this book: <humor-tell>active eyes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>flushing, higher speaking register</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reduction of physical tension</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxed posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>efforts to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>fast thinking</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>fast speaking</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>louder voice</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>optimism, raised spirits</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reduction of stress</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>.</li>
    
    <li><i>Humor tells = humor = humor family words.</i> These are all different ways of looking at the same thing. This is why humor tells individually carry humor qualities like <a href="8-3-humor-tell-change-over-time-to-express-change-in-intensity.html#exclude-navigation">intensity and duration</a>. A smile has degrees of intensity or duration.</li>
        
    <li>Humor tells combine with other emotion tells to make up our <a href="8-5-humor-tells-are-expressed-in-many-different-ways.html#exclude-navigation">emotional state</a>. For instance, humor tells and anger tells together mean we have humor and anger simultaneously in our emotional state.</li>
