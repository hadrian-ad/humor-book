Pattern languages
</h1>


One way we define things is through “pattern definitions.” Pattern definitions are much closer to how our brains work than dictionary definitions—they’re why we can drive past ten barns and recognize them each as a “barn,” even though none of them looks exactly alike. 

To see how pattern definitions works, we can make a simple pattern definition for a barn. We’ll start by making a list of things we understand to be possible elements of barns: 

Elements of our pattern definition:

silo
big double doors
stand alone structure
red
winch
fodder
made of wood
gambrel roof


(and so on)

Then, we assign weight to each element of a barn, since some things are more important to what a barn “is” than others. One way of doing this is by assigning points for “barnness:”

Elements of our pattern definition:

silo (10) (<- ten points toward “barnness”)
big double doors (5)
stand alone structure (3)
red (2)
winch (5)
fodder (3)
made of wood (2)
gambrel roof (5)
 (and so on)

The final piece of a pattern definition is to set a point threshold for what we identify as a barn. Let’s say 15 points is the threshold where we tag a structure as being a barn. Now, if we come across three very different buildings, we’ll be able to classify each one as barn or not-barn:  

Structure #1

silo (10)
winch (5)



= 15 points of barnness = “it’s a barn!” 

Structure #2

stand alone structure (3)

red (2)
big double doors (5)
fodder (2)
made of wood (3)



= 15 points of barnness = “it’s a barn!”          

Structure #3

stand alone structure (3)

made of wood (3)

gambrel roof (5)
= 11 points of barnness = “well it’s barn-like…”
This gives us a very flexible system for identification and classification. We’ll have patterns in our head for barns, houses, monasteries, outhouses, sheds, warehouses, and so on—which we can mix and match to describe even buildings that are unique in all the world. (“Well, it looks like a mix between a barn and a… monastery?”)

There’s no official cosmic pattern definition for a barn. They’re just definitions we make up ourselves, out of everything we know about them. This means these pattern definitions vary person-by-person, based on our experiences.

> Consider:

Someone who grew up in Japan would have a different pattern definition for “barn” than someone who grew up in France. Similarly, someone who uses or researches barns would have a different pattern definition for “barn” than we would.

The pattern definition above is just based on the barns we see in children’s books and stock photos—it's probably not a very good pattern definition for most practical purposes. As we gain more awareness about barns, we’d update and refine our definition. 

In this chapter, we’ve been making a pattern definition of humor:

 Elements of our pattern definition:

laughter (10)

smiling (5)

brightening (3)

(and so on)

We have a set of possible reaction elements (frowning, crying, winking, dancing, laughing, and so on), and we can decide which of these reaction elements are part of the humor pattern. This lets us take an emotional state that’s unique in all the world and try to make sense of whether it has what we’ve patterned as “humor” in it.

This helps us think why we might be able see a hundred people feel humor a hundred times each, and still recognize it all as humor—even though none of those moments of humor are exactly alike. It’s for the same reason we can recognize a thousand different structures as barns, even if none of them are exactly alike!

We can also use pattern definitions to think about what emotions are. We take the set of possible human reaction elements (“emotion tells”), and see which ones co-occur in distinguishable relationships. We give names to these patterns, like “sadness” or “anger.” But it’s important to notice that there isn’t an "official" definition to an emotion like anger, since there are so many ways to tweak our pattern definition of it.

> Consider:

For instance, maybe the convention fifty years ago was that anger required 25 points to be “anger”—but today the word anger only requires 15 points. Maybe a hundred years ago, blasphemous cursing was 15 points toward anger, but today is usually only 5 points toward anger. 

 

Maybe one language has a very broad pattern for "anger," but another language splits this pattern up into two emotions. Maybe another language doesn't have a word for "anger" and uses a word like "hurt" instead.

In this book, we’re using a pattern definition of humor that’s broader than is often conventional—in part because we're allowing for low-intensities of humor. This fits with our experiences. Once it's pointed out, we already see small smiles and minor movements in the eyebrows as expressions of humor too—not just belly laughing.

We can also use pattern definitions to think about why achievement and generosity can be thought of as humor—even though we feel we can somewhat distinguish between achievement and generosity. Humor family words (like achievement) are pattern definitions that sit within a broader pattern of humor—similar to how irritability and frustration are specific patterns within a broader pattern of anger.

Finally, "humor" tends to exclude context from being part of its pattern definition—while humor family words explicitly include context as part of its pattern definition.

As we’ll see throughout this book, this kind of definition of humor will let us talk about ourselves and the world in some interesting ways—and think productively through some of the underlying systems of ourselves.
