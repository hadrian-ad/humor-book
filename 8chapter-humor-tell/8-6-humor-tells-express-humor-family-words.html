Humor tells express humor family words
</h1>


<p>Last chapter, we looked at <a href="../7chapter-humor-family-words/7-0-humor-family-words.html"><strong>humor family words</strong></a>—context-specific variations of the generic word “humor.”</p>

<p>Since humor family words are alternative words for <emotions>humor</emotions>, we’ll see humor tells whenever someone feels <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on:</p>

<p>Above, grandparents feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions> and so on—and so they expresses humor tells like <humor-tell>social seeking (with the baby or someone off-camera)</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>socially tightening (by sitting close to each other)</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxing posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>having energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>having raised spirits</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>expressing optimism</humor-tell>, and so on.</p> 

<p>We see the same thing in the picture below. There’s a quiet moment at a petting zoo, and the caretaker of the camel stops by to readjust its harness and check up on it:</p>

<p>The man feels <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on—and so he expresses humor tells like <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxed posture (leaning on bar)</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness (ignoring what’s around him)</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening (with camel)</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Since the humor tells are strongly expressed, we can see the engineers feel high-intensity humor. But we can also guess that their humor has a long duration too.</p> 

<p class="considertext">The durability of expectations often controls the duration of humor. Years of hard work established durable expectations, and so it took them a long time to acclimate to any deviations from those expectations. In this case, it led to long-duration humor.

<p>When the woman finishes her song to applause, her humor tells show accomplishment, achievement, delight, success, and so on.</p>

<p>When asked a question, her humor tells show comfort, safety, and welcome. When she's surprised by something the man says, her humor tells show insight and realization. Throughout the conversation, her humor tells show appreciation, connection, belonging, joy, and so on.</p> 

<p>While she laughs several times and smiles throughout, we should look beyond those too for other humor tells: like how she has energy, flushes, moves informally with informal posture (swaying), touches self (hands clasped), social seeking and social tightening, focused on present, raised spirits, and so on.</p> 

<p>The man shows far fewer humor tells, and so we should be careful when characterizing their emotional states together. ("They both feel humor.")</p>
    
    </div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example"> Example #2 (Wartime occupation)</button>

<div class="content-example">   

 <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RIWfH3iEgXU?start=377&amp;end=415" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe> 

<p>When the camera cuts to the audience, we see them staggered (informal posture, informal movement, loosening, relaxed posture, non-normative behavior), with red faces (flushing) and complete loss of situational awareness. They at least briefly feel optimism, raised spirits, reduction of stress, and feel social integration. They touch each other.</p> 

<p>These humor tells express humor family words: the audience feels acceptance, appreciation, connection, delight, forgiveness, reconciliation, release, revelation, relief, and so on. Because the humor tells are so intense, we'd say these humor family words were also correspondingly intense (intense appreciation, intense release, and so on). Because the humor was such a long duration, we'd say that the mistake went against durable expectations. </p>

<p>Note that just because we can describe the soldiers' humor as "intense reconciliation (with the situation)," that doesn't tell us how long this feeling will persist; what actions will be taken because of it; and so on. ("Oh! They all must have had a great time with their under-armored humvees.")</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example"> Example #3 (Act of friendship)</button>

<div class="content-example"> 

<video preload="auto" autoplay="autoplay" loop="loop" style="width: 400px; height: 600px;">
    <source src="../plaza-olsen.mp4"></source>
</video>

<p>The friend who gets the scarf feels realization (as she understands what happens), comfort, generosity, belonging, appreciation, release, safety, welcome, and so on—and so smiles, social seeks, social tightens, brightens, relaxes, and so on.</p>
 
<p>The friend who applies the scarf at first doesn't seem to feel humor, but we'll notice she increasingly smiles throughout the clip. We can see her humor more clearly when we look for humor tells other than just smiling and laughing: she touches others, is making an effort to spread humor, is focusing on present, shows increased agency (relative to right before), socially tightens, tries to increase social integration, and so on. Because of these humor wells, we can describe both of their emotional states with similar humor family words—even if one of them feels this more intensely than the other.</p>

    </div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example"> Example #4 (Sumo wrestling)</button>

<div class="content-example">

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k2itSyAO3Qs?start=47&amp;end=59" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>

<p>As the victorious wrestler stands, he smiles, brightens, has expansive posture, loosens, has high energy (relative to the other wrestler), has increased agency (relative to the other), has raised spirits, socially tightens (by moving closer to the other), and so on.</p> 

<p>This humor can be hard to see at first, since the humor tells are reserved relative to other humor tells we've seen. It's easier to see when compared relative to the losing wrestler—who shows inverse humor tells. His posture contracts rather than expands, he socially avoids rather than socially seeks, has lowered spirits instead of raised spirits, and so on.</p>

<p>Since humor tells and humor family words are the same thing ("humor"), we can describe the victorious sumo as feeling accomplishment, achievement, comfort, joy, realization, release, relief, safety, success, and so on.</p> 

<p>We can also notice how the the crowd is showing humor tells and feeling humor family words—more intensely than the wrestler is in this clip. If they hold up their arms and stand up, they have expansive posture; if they cheer loudly they raise their voices; if they lose track of time they lose situational awareness; and so on.</p>
