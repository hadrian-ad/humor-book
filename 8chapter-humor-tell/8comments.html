<p>This is often most obvious when we overhear something odd and share a glance with a friend. If we're in a formal setting, we won't grin and laugh&mdash;instead we'll raise an eyebrow and set our face a specific way. In this case, we're <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> <callback>(sharing a glance)</callback>, <humor-tell>making effort to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell> <callback>(whatever was on our mind briefly disappeared)</callback>, <humor-tell>losing  situational awareness</humor-tell> <callback>(we break awareness to glance at each other)</callback>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell> <callback>(our facial expressions are distinctive)</callback>, <humor-tell>reducing stress</humor-tell> <callback>(our glance makes us feel looser)</callback>, and so on.</p> 





<p>This also helps us think about humor that's part of mixed emotional states. We may feel <emotions>humor</emotions> <sem>and</sem> <emotions>anger</emotions>; <emotions>humor</emotions> <sem>and</sem> <emotions>boredom</emotions>; and so on. 
    </p>


<p>When this happens, we donâ€™t always feel high-intensity humor. Instead, the humor may just be expressed as <humor-tell>small smiles</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>fast thinking</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>temporary social seeking</humor-tell>, and so on&mdash;which co-occur with mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotion tells, like <outcome-contrast>embarrassed</outcome-contrast> <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> <callback>(humor <sem>and</sem> mistake-predominant emotions)</callback> or <outcome-contrast>bored</outcome-contrast> <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> <callback>(humor <sem>and</sem> OK-predominant emotions)</callback>.</p>



<p>This helps us think about all moments of humor&mdash;not just high-intensity humor, but the more common moments of low-intensity humor and mixed-emotional states as well.

    <p>We don't want to be blind to low-intensity sadness, whether it happens on its own or bookends moments of high-intensity sadness.</p>
