Most humor is low-intensity humor
</h1>


<p>Most of the humor we feel isn’t very intense. <term>Sometimes</term> our humor crests into laughter, but <em>most</em> of the time, our humor happens at lower intensities—like how we bounce, hum, smile, talk excitedly, whistle, and so on more often than we laugh:</p>

<p>And even when our humor <term>crests</term> into laughter, our laughter is still <em>bookended</em> by lower-intensity humor—like below, where the peak of loud laughter is bookended by talking excitedly and bouncing.</p>

<p>
    If we think of <term>all</term> humor as being the peak moments of intense humor (loud <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>), we’ll end up ignoring <em>most</em> of the humor we feel.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">
    At first, “talk excitedly” doesn't seem like humor. But we "talk excitedly" is often a <sem>composite</sem> of humor tells—when someone talks excitedly, they’re <humor-tell>socially integrating</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>socially tightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>having high energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>thinking fast</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raising speaking register</humor-tell>, and so on.</p></div>
 
<p>This also helps us think about humor that's part of mixed emotional states. We may feel <emotions>humor</emotions> <sem>and</sem> <emotions>anger</emotions>; <emotions>humor</emotions> <sem>and</sem> <emotions>boredom</emotions>; and so on. 
    </p>


<p>When this happens, we don’t always feel high-intensity humor. Instead, the humor may just be expressed as <humor-tell>small smiles</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>fast thinking</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>temporary social seeking</humor-tell>, and so on—which co-occur with mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotion tells, like <outcome-contrast>embarrassed</outcome-contrast> <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> <callback>(humor <sem>and</sem> mistake-predominant emotions)</callback> or <outcome-contrast>bored</outcome-contrast> <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> <callback>(humor <sem>and</sem> OK-predominant emotions)</callback>.</p>



<p>This helps us think about all moments of humor—not just high-intensity humor, but the more common moments of low-intensity humor and mixed-emotional states as well. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="box"> 

<p><headline>Blindness.</headline> If we only thought of sadness as sobbing, we’d be blind to most of the sadness people feel. Sadness <term>sometimes</term> crest into a climactic expression (<i>sobbing</i> or <i>wailing</i>), but it doesn't <em>always</em>.</p> 

<p>Instead, our sadness may just be at a low-intensity where we just <i>feel dispirited</i>, <i>have low-energy</i>, <i>get tired easily</i>, <i>feel pessimistic</i>, and so on. This is sadness too—whether or not sobbing is ever involved.</p>

<p>We don't want to be blind to low-intensity sadness, whether it happens on its own or bookends moments of high-intensity sadness.</p>
     
<p>It's the exact same for humor. In the same way that <emotions>sadness</emotions> is more than just <i>sobbing</i>, <emotions>humor</emotions> is more than just <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>. We don't want to be blind to low-intensity humor—or to how low-intensity humor bookends moments of high-intensity humor.</p>
