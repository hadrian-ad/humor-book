Most humor is low-intensity humor
</h1>


Most of the humor we feel isn’t very intense. Sometimes our humor is so intense we laugh loudly—but most of the time, our humor happens at lower intensities, like how we bounce, hum, smile, talk excitedly, whistle, and so on more often than we laugh.

We often feel humor without the intensity cresting into laughter:

And even when our humor does crest into laughter, our laughter is still bookended by lower-intensity humor—like below, where the peak of loud laughter was bookended by talking excitedly and bouncing.

If we only think of humor as being the peak moments of intense humor (loud laughter), we’ll end up ignoring most of the humor we feel.

> Consider:
“Talk excitedly” is a composite of humor tells. When someone talks excitedly, they’re socially integrating, socially tightening, having high energy, thinking fast, raising speaking register, and so on. This is why talking excitedly can show humor—even if there’s no laughter.
 
We can use humor tells to think about humor that's part of mixed emotional states. We may feel humor and anger; humor and boredom; and so on. 



When this happens, we don’t always feel high-intensity humor. Instead, the humor may just be expressed as small smiles, fast thinking, temporary social seeking, and so on—which co-occur with mistake-predominant emotion tells or OK-predominant emotion tells—like small smiles while we cry, or turn red from embarrassment.



This helps us think about all our moments of humor—not just high-intensity humor, but the more common moments of low-intensity humor as well. 





 

Blind. If we only think of sadness as sobbing, we’d be blind to most of the sadness we and others feel. And in the same way that sadness is more than just sobbing, humor is more than just laughter. 

 

Like humor, sadness can crest into a climactic expression (sobbing), but it doesn't have too. We may just feel low-intensity sadness where we just feel dispirited, have low-energy, get tired easily, feel pessimistic, and so on. This is sadness too.



We don't want to be blind to this low-intensity sadness, or how low-intensity sadness bookends moments of high-intensity sadness. It's the exact same for humor. We'd miss observations if we thought sadness didn't exist outside crying—just like we'd miss observations if we thought humor didn't exist outside of smiling and laughing.
