Humor means humor tells 
</h1>


<p>We can annotate more pictures to get a better sense of <vocab>humor tells</vocab>:</p>

<p>Above, the woman <humor-tell>brightens</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>flushes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>activates eyes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>thinks fast</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focuses on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>has energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seeks</humor-tell> <callback>(turns to comment to someone)</callback>, <humor-tell>social tightens</humor-tell> <callback>(slows pace to let others get closer)</callback>, and so on.</p> 

<p>Since there are many humor tells that are clearly expressed, humor is the majority of her emotional state:</p>

<p>Even though we often think of humor as something expressed with laughter and smiles, this isn’t always the case—like in the picture below, where the man is feeling humor <outcome-contrast>without</outcome-contrast> <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>:</p>

<img class="photo" src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-1-images/8-1-2-no-smile-hadrian-chicken.jpg"

<p>The man above is <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>making efforts to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>showing non-normative behavior</humor-tell>. So even though <term>some</term> common humor tells are <term>absent</term> <callback>(smiling)</callback>, there's enough <em>other</em> humor tells <em>present</em> for us to say there's humor in his emotional state.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">
    In the picture above we're using <sem>decisions</sem> to identify humor. By keeping the chicken on his head, the man is making a choice to <humor-tell>spread humor</humor-tell> and have <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>. If he <term>wasn’t</term> feeling humor, he <em>wouldn’t</em> be making these choices—he’d instead take the chicken off his head.</p> </div>

<p>Even though we can identity humor in the man above, there aren’t enough humor tells for us to think his humor is particularly intense or prominent. In this case, we’d see his humor as  part of a mixed emotional state:</p>

<p>We can look at another picture where humor is a minor part of a mixed emotional state:</p>

<img class="photo" src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-1-images/8-1-4-complicated-smile.jpg"

title=""

style="max-width: 20rem;"

<p>Above, the man has (partially) <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell>, a (light) <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, (unenthusiastic) <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> (by glancing at the picture taker). These humor tells help us see there’s at least some humor in his emotional state.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">If the man had <outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor, he would have more inverse humor tells: instead of <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, he would be <outcome-contrast>frowning</outcome-contrast>; instead of <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell>, he would have <outcome-contrast>contracting posture</outcome-contrast>; and so on. Since this isn’t the case, we can say that there’s at least some humor in his emotional state.</p></div> 

<p>The man isn’t just expressing humor tells, but other emotion tells at the same time—these other emotion tells show <emotions>exasperation</emotions>, <emotions>frustration</emotions>, <emotions>tiredness</emotions>, and so on. Because of this, we'd say the man has a mixed emotional state that includes some humor, but not much.</p>

<p><headline>Inference.</headline> Sometimes emotion tells are things we observe <term>directly</term>, like <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>. But other times emotion tells can be inferred <em>indirectly</em>&mdash;like how we can sometimes gauge our partner’s emotional state by:</p>
<ul class="close-list">
   <li>what's on their grocery receipt</li>
    <li>what they’ve been watching recently</li>
    <li>whether they leave early or late</li>
    <li>how many hours they’ve spent playing which game</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

 
<p>That's because emotion tells are more than facial expressions—emotion tells are actions and decisions too. This is obvious with cats—since they have a very limited range of facial expressions, we learn to pay attention to their actions to learn their emotional states.</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>if a cat is afraid, it hides</li>
    <li>if it’s in a good mood, it looks for people</li>
    <li>if it’s stressed, it pees everywhere</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>What expresses the cat's emotional state isn't so much in their <term>face</term>, which expresses little—but their <em>actions</em> and <em>decisions</em>. The cat's absence or the cat’s pee are <sem>themselves</sem> emotion tells. 
    
<p>It's the same for humans. While we also express emotion tells through our face, like cats we also express emotion tells through actions and decisions—which is as true for <emotions>humor</emotions> as it is for <emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>sadness</emotions>, and so on.</p>
