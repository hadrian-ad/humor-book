Humor tells are expressed in many different ways
</h1>



<p>Each humor tell has an endless variation in how it can be expressed—like <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>:</p>

<h2>Variations of laughs</h2>
<ul class="close-list">
   <li>loud laughs</li>
    <li>pff-laughs</li>
    <li>scoff-laughs</li>
    <li>tsk-laughs</li>
    <li>explosive laughs</li>
    <li>nose-laughs</li>
    <li>hahs</li>
    <li>hm!s</li>
    <li>hehs</li>
    <li>huhs</li>
    <li>hurhs</li>
    <li>cackles</li>
    <li>chortles</li>
    <li>chuckles</li>
    <li>titters</li>
    <li>snickers</li>
    <li>giggles</li>
    <li>guffaws</li>
    <li>snorts</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>In this book, we’ll referring to all of these exhales and inhales generically as <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>.</p> 

<p>So when people generically <action>*laugh*</action> in our examples, it doesn't usually mean they had some kind of cliche, high-intensity laughter. (<humor-tell>“Hahahahahahah!”</humor-tell>) Instead, it usually refers to a laugh that’s less intense and in endless variety—like <humor-tell>“pff!”</humor-tell> <humor-tell>“ah!”</humor-tell> <humor-tell>“heh!”</humor-tell>, and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>We can see this in some examples:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
   <p>Trevor: <action>*playing StormConQuest*</action> <internalaction>(frustrated)</internalaction> <speech>“I can’t beat the Ogre Time Magistrate. I’ve been trying for hours. It’s just not possible.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <speech>“Did you buy armor potions?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*pause*</action> <internalaction>(confused)</internalaction> <speech>“Do his magic arrows do physical damage?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Half physical, half magical.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;laugh-like exhale like <humor-tell>uuahh!</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>aahh!</humor-tell>)</notes> <speech>“Fuuuck me.”</speech></p>

    <p>In our day-to-day conversations, we don’t always have an overall word for sounds like <callback>“hm!”</callback> or <callback>“huh!”</callback> or <callback>“fff!!”</callback> But in this book, we’ll just call them <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>.</p> 

<p>In the same way a half-smile and a full smile are different intensities of the same overall thing <callback>(a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>)</callback>—hm! and hahahahah! are different intensities of the same overall thing <callback>(a <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>)</callback>.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We’ll mostly use the generic <action>*laughs*</action> throughout this book to indicate all kinds of <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>. This keeps our examples easy to read, even though it does cut out specific information about that humor's duration, intensity, and so on.</p>
    
 <p class="considertext">It's the same for many humor tells too—characters in this book will generically <action>*smile*</action> to indicate all kinds of situationally specific and richly detailed <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>.</p>

    <div class="box">
    

<p><headline>Inflection.</headline> Like any humor tell, how we laugh conveys a lot of nuance about the intensity and duration of our humor. <callback>("Heh" versus "HAH!" and "hahahahaha" versus "HAHAHAHAHA!")</callback> But how we laugh also conveys whether our evaluations are tilted toward mistake- or OK-predominance.</p> 
 
<p>When our mistake and OK are cleanly balanced, our laugh may just show humor. But if our evaluations <sem>aren't</sem> cleanly balanced, our laugh can show that we're leaning toward the OK-predominant zone <callback>(like Jessica's "hm!")</callback>, or that we're leaning toward the mistake-predominant zone <callback>(like Trevor's "uuahh!")</callback>:</p>

<p>Jessica's and Trevor's evaluations fell on different sides of the watershed line of highest-intensity humor. This inflection to one side or the other was conveyed through how they laughed.</p> 

<p>This is the same for all humor tells. Each can be tinged with mistake-predominance or OK-predominance. We have angry or sad smiles <callback>(humor mingled with mistake-predominant emotions)</callback>, and bored or social smiles <callback>(humor mingled with OK-predominant emotions)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p>
    Sometimes these blended emotion tell words are a bit disguised. A "grimace" and a "dreamy look" are both often <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>—only bundled with an inflection toward mistake- or OK-predominant evaluations.
