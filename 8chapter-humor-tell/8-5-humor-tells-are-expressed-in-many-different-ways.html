Humor tells are expressed in mayn different ways
</h1>



<p>Each humor tell has an endless variation in how it can be expressed—like with laughter.</p> 

<p>Some of this diversity and nuance to laughter is captured in our existing words or transcriptions. We have:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>loud laughs</li>
    <li>pff-laughs</li>
    <li>scoff-laughs</li>
    <li>tsk-laughs</li>
    <li>explosive laughs</li>
    <li>nose-laughs</li>
    <li>hahs</li>
    <li>hm!s</li>
    <li>hehs</li>
    <li>huhs</li>
    <li>hurhs</li>
    <li>cackles</li>
    <li>chortles</li>
    <li>chuckles</li>
    <li>titters</li>
    <li>snickers</li>
    <li>giggles</li>
    <li>guffaws</li>
    <li>snorts</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>(and so on)</i></p>

<p>In this book, we’ll referring to all of these exhales and inhales as <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell> or <action>*laughs*</action>.</p> 

<p>People often <action>*laugh*</action> in our examples—but this doesn't usually mean they had high-intensity laughter. <callback>(“Hahahahahahah!”)</callback> Instead, it usually refers to a laugh that’s less intense. <callback>(“pff!” “ah!” “heh!”, and so on.)</callback></p> 
 
 <p>We can see this in some examples:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
   <p>Trevor: <action>*playing StormConQuest*</action> <internalaction>(frustrated)</internalaction> <speech>“I can’t beat the Ogre Time Magistrate. I’ve been trying for hours. It’s just not possible.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <speech>“Did you buy armor potions?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*pause*</action> <internalaction>(confused)</internalaction> <speech>“Do his magic arrows do physical damage?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Half physical, half magical.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;laugh-like exhale like uuahh! or aahh!)</notes> <speech>“Fuuuck me.”</speech></p>
    </div>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*telling joke*</action> <speech>“… and that’s why they always called him… Moo-shroom!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;laugh-like exhale like pfff or pssh)</notes></p>
    </div>
 

<div class="vignette">
   <p>
       <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*reading trivia on her bottle of sweet tea*</action> <speech>“Emma! Did you know sharks can lose 100 teeth a day!”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;laugh-like exhale like hm! Or Hhuh)</notes>
   </p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*not really listening*</action> <speech>“Really?”</speech></p>
    </div>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title: “Wherever You Go, There You Are.” She thinks about that for a second, puzzled. Then she laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;laugh-like exhale out the nose)</notes>
    </p>
    
     </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Owen is watching Fired Fireman. After Chief fails to stop the Master Arsonist, he becomes depressed and no one knows where he is. Finally, Victoria discovers he’s been living in a garbage bin the past month.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Victoria:</speaker> <internalaction>(happy)</internalaction> <internalaction>(concerned)</internalaction> <speech>“Chief! We’ve been so worried about you. We know you did everything you could. You don’t need to hide from us."</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Chief:</speaker> <speech>“Um. I prefer the term ‘tactical self-ostracization.”</speech></p>
    
    <p>
        <speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;laugh-like exhale like tss! or ah! or a snort)</notes>
    </p> 
    
    </div>
    
    <p>In our day-to-day conversations, we don’t always have an overall word for sounds like “hm!” or “huh!” or “fff!!” But in this book, we’ll just call them <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>.</p> 

<p>In the same way a <humor-tell>half-smile</humor-tell> and a <humor-tell>full smile</humor-tell> are different intensities of the same thing (<humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>), <humor-tell>hm!</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>hahahahah!</humor-tell> are different intensities of the same thing (<humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>).</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We’ll mostly use <action>*laughs*</action> throughout this book to indicate all the wide variaties of <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>. While using a catch-all word cuts out information about humor's duration, intensity, and so on—it does keep our examples easy to read.</p>

<p>Like any humor tell, how we laugh conveys a lot of nuance about the intensity and duration of our humor. But how we laugh also conveys where we fall on our graph of our three emotional zones.</p> 
 
<p>If our evaluations are cleanly balanced, we may laugh in a way that just shows humor. But if our evaluations <em>aren't</em> cleanly balanced, our laugh can show that we're leaning toward the OK-predominant zone <callback>(Jessica's "hm!")</callback>, or that we're leaning toward the mistake-predominant zone <callback>(Trevor's "uuahh!")</callback>:</p>

<p>Jessica's and Trevor's evaluations fell on different sides of the watershed line of highest-intensity humor—nuance that was conveyed through how they laughed.</p> 

<p>This is the same for all humor tells, which each can be tinged with mistake-predominance or OK-predominance. For instance, a <humor-tell>grimace</humor-tell> sometimes refers to a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> expressing both humor and mistake-predominant emotions—and a <humor-tell>dreamy look</humor-tell> often refers to a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> expressing both humor and OK-predominant emotions.</p>
