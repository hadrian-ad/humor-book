Humor tells express intensity of humor
</h1>


<p>Humor has an <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a> to it, and humor tells convey this intensity. Humor tells can do this because they have low-intensity and high-intensity variations.</p> 

<p>This is familiar with <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>. When we feel high-intensity humor, we <humor-tell>beam</humor-tell>. When we feel low-intensity humor, we give a <humor-tell>half-smile</humor-tell>. Both beaming and half-smiling are the <term>same</term> humor tell—<humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>—only at <em>different</em> intensities:</p>

<p>The woman is giving a <humor-tell>broad smile</humor-tell>, the man a <humor-tell>half-smile</humor-tell>. The intensity of the humor tell corresponds to the intensity of their humor. </p>

<p>Sometimes, we only think of humor as high-intensity humor, like belly laughs. But humor can <em>also</em> be made up of low-intensity humor tells too, like in the pair below:</p>

<p>At first, we may not register any humor in the picture above, since no one is laughing. But at the same time, we can see someone is <humor-tell>reducing physical tension</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxing posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>making effort to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>losing of situational awareness</humor-tell> (turning from an event toward a companion), <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> (turning toward a companion), and so on.</p> 

<p>In this case, we’d say both of them are feeling at least low-intensity humor—even though there's no <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>.</p>

<p>We can annotate humor tells in videos, just like we can with pictures: </p>

<p>In this performance, something happens that causes the singer to feel <emotions>humor</emotions>. Her face <humor-tell>brightens</humor-tell>, she <humor-tell>gains energy</humor-tell>, her <humor-tell>eyes twinkle</humor-tell>, she <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>, her <humor-tell>posture loosens</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>relaxes</humor-tell>, she has a <humor-tell>reduction of physical tension</humor-tell>. She <humor-tell>loses some situational awareness</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>focuses on the present</humor-tell>. She wants to <humor-tell>spread humor</humor-tell> to the guitarist, and does this by <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>social tightening (by turning to look at the guitarist)</humor-tell>. Compared to simply singing the song, we see her humor as corresponding to a moment of <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell>.</p> 

<p>The guitarist eventually notices or remembers what made the singer feel humor, and he <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>brightens</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosens</humor-tell>, and so on. He <humor-tell>loses some situational awareness</humor-tell> as he socially tightens (by turning toward the singer).</p>

<p><headline>Laughing isn't humor.</headline> When enough humor tells happen together, it's humor—and while smiling or laughing is often one of those humor tells, they're not <sem>always</sem> part of humor. We can feel humor, even without smiling or laughing! </p>

<p>This happens all the time, like how we may not smile or laugh as we walk along a low wall (<humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>)—or bob our head slightly to a song as we walk through a store (<humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell>).</p> 

<p>This is often most obvious when we share a glance with a friend after overhearing something odd. We raise an eyebrow and set our face a specific way. In this case, we're <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> (sharing a glance), <humor-tell>making effort to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell> (whatever was on our mind briefly disappeared), <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell> (we break awareness to glance at each other), <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell> (our facial expressions are distinctive), <humor-tell>reducing stress</humor-tell> (our glance makes us feel looser), and so on.</p> 

<p>In this case, we'd be feeling humor without also <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>.</p>
