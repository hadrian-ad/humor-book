Humor tells express intensity
</h1>


<p>Humor tells have <term>low-intensity</term> and <em>high-intensity</em> variations. This corresponds to the intensity of humor.</p> 

<p>This is familiar with <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>. Sometimes we just half-smile, and other times we beam. Both beaming and half-smiling are the <term>same</term> humor tell <callback>(<humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>)</callback> at <em>different</em> intensities:</p>  

<img src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-2-images/8-2-0-smiling-comparison.png"

title="The spectrum of intensity of a of a smile"
alt="This image is titled 'smile.' It shows close-ups of the faces of the photo of the man vaguely smiling as he loses at chess and of the woman smiling broadly at a market. Arrows place the two smiles on a spectrum of less intense to more intense humor. An annotation says 'a smile has a scale of intensity'"
style=""
>

<p>The woman is giving a <humor-tell>broad smile</humor-tell>, the man a <humor-tell>half-smile</humor-tell>. The intensity of the humor tell corresponds to the intensity of their humor. </p>

<p>Sometimes, we only think of humor as high-intensity humor, like belly laughs. But humor can <sem>also</sem> be made up of low-intensity humor tells too, like in the pair below:</p>

<img class="photo" src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-2-images/8-2-1-couple-concert.jpg"

title="Humor can be made of low-intensity humor tells"
alt="This image shows a couple at a concert. One looks at their phone, the other lightly smiles with a hand close to their thigh."
style=" margin-left: 1rem;"
>

<p>At first, we may not register any humor in the picture above, since no one is laughing. But at the same time, we can see someone is <humor-tell>reducing physical tension</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxing posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>making effort to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>losing of situational awareness</humor-tell> <callback>(turning from an event toward a companion)</callback>, <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> <callback>(turning toward a companion)</callback>, and so on.</p> 

<p>In this case, weâ€™d say both of them are feeling at least low-intensity humor&mdash;even though there's no <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>.</p>

<p><headline>Laughing isn't humor.</headline> When enough humor tells happen together, it's humor. And while <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell> is <term>often</term> one of those humor tells, they're not <em>always</em> part of humor. We can feel humor, even without smiling or laughing! </p>

<p>We may not smile or laugh as we:</p>  

<ul class="close-list">

         <li>
       walk along a low wall <humor-tell>(non-normative behavior)</humor-tell>
   </li>
    <li>
        bob our head slightly to a song as we walk through a store <humor-tell>(increased energy)</humor-tell>
    </li>
    <li>share a glance with a friend after the person we're talking to says something odd <humor-tell>(social seeking)</humor-tell></li>
</ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>



<p>These are all familiar instances where many of us feel humor without <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>&mdash;something that happens all the time, all across our lives!</p>
