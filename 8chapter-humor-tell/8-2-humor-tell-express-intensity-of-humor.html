Humor tells express intensity
</h1>


<p>Humor has an <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a> to it, and humor tells convey this intensity. Humor tells can do this because they have low-intensity and high-intensity variations.</p> 

<p>This is familiar with <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>. When we feel high-intensity humor, we <humor-tell>beam</humor-tell>. When we feel low-intensity humor, we give a <humor-tell>half-smile</humor-tell>. Both beaming and half-smiling are the <term>same</term> humor tell—<humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>—only at <em>different</em> intensities:</p>

title="The spectrum of intensity of a of a smile"
alt="This image is titled 'smile.' It shows close-ups of the faces of the photo of the man vaguely smiling as he loses at chess and of the woman smiling broadly at a market. Arrows place the two smiles on a spectrum of less intense to more intense humor. An annotation says 'a smile has a scale of intensity'"
style=""
>

<p>The woman is giving a <humor-tell>broad smile</humor-tell>, the man a <humor-tell>half-smile</humor-tell>. The intensity of the humor tell corresponds to the intensity of their humor. </p>

<p>Sometimes, we only think of humor as high-intensity humor, like belly laughs. But humor can <sem>also</sem> be made up of low-intensity humor tells too, like in the pair below:</p>

<img class="photo" src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-2-images/8-2-1-couple-concert.jpg"

title="Humor can be made of low-intensity humor tells"
alt="This image shows a couple at a concert. One looks at their phone, the other lightly smiles with a hand close to their thigh."

<p>At first, we may not register any humor in the picture above, since no one is laughing. But at the same time, we can see someone is <humor-tell>reducing physical tension</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxing posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>making effort to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>losing of situational awareness</humor-tell> <callback>(turning from an event toward a companion)</callback>, <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> <callback>(turning toward a companion)</callback>, and so on.</p> 

<p>In this case, we’d say both of them are feeling at least low-intensity humor—even though there's no <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>.</p>

<p><headline>Laughing isn't humor.</headline> When enough humor tells happen together, it's humor—and while <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell> is often one of those humor tells, they're not <sem>always</sem> part of humor. We can feel humor, even without smiling or laughing! </p>

<p>This happens all the time, like how we may not smile or laugh as we walk along a low wall <humor-tell>(non-normative behavior)</humor-tell>—or bob our head slightly to a song as we walk through a store <humor-tell>(increased energy)</humor-tell>.</p> 

<p>This is often most obvious when we share a glance with a friend after overhearing something odd. If we're in a formal setting, we won't grin and laugh&mdash;instead we'll raise an eyebrow and set our face a specific way. In this case, we're <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> <callback>(sharing a glance)</callback>, <humor-tell>making effort to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell> <callback>(whatever was on our mind briefly disappeared)</callback>, <humor-tell>losing  situational awareness</humor-tell> <callback>(we break awareness to glance at each other)</callback>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell> <callback>(our facial expressions are distinctive)</callback>, <humor-tell>reducing stress</humor-tell> <callback>(our glance makes us feel looser)</callback>, and so on.</p> 

<p>In a case like this, we're feeling humor without <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>.</p>
