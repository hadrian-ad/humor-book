<!--

<div class="about-box">  
      <p>It's good to be vigilant to models of humor. In the past, you'd have people making models of positive experiences in ways that were weird and sometimes harmful. <callback>("There is no joy greater than hard work" "Upbeat women have a medical condition called 'hysteria'" and so on.)</callback>  So there's a lot of suspicion of people trying to tell us "what humor really is."</p>
      
      <p>It's good to be suspicious! In this book, we'll continuously ground our analytical model to narrative stories about daily life. This helps us avoid ending up with something abstract and disconnected. By the end, you'll have to make your own assessment about how the model in this book fits your observations and needs.</p>
        </div>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Dispelling myths</h2>

<p>Along the way, we'll be freeing ourselves of some of the myths we have about humor—myths that are probably pretty familiar to us, but don't actually make much sense when laid out:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
       <li><em>I</em> haven't been <em>taught</em> humor before. Therefore, humor <em>can't</em> be taught.</li>
        <li>Some people seem <em>naturally</em> funny. Therefore, <em>I</em> can't become funnier.</li> 
        <li><em>Comedians</em> are funny. Therefore, comedians are the standard to which <em>everyone</em> should be compared to, humorwise.</li>
        <li><em>Some</em> humor seems trivializing. Therefore, <em>all</em> humor is trivializing.</li>
        <li>We <em>sometimes</em> laugh at jokes. Therefore <em>everything</em> we laugh at is a joke.</li>
        <li>Funny <em>movies</em> sometimes have clever and witty scripts. Therefore, to make people laugh, <em>I</em> have to be clever and witty, like a script.
    </li>
        </ul>
    
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>These informal logic fallacies can cause us a lot of trouble! By examining them, we'll find our thinking about humor becomes much lighter and more powerful.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">My fieldwork on humor</h2>

<p>Over the years, I've been an after school teacher, barista, canvasser, cashier, dance teacher, event coordinator, facilitator, greeter, tutor, and so on. In each of these positions, you sink or swim on your ability to generate smiles and laughs!
</p>

<p>And like everyone in these roles, I was constantly around coworkers who were better than I was at generating smiles and laughs—it was often astonishing what they could do. I took a lot of notes, studying what worked, what didn't, when, on who, what happened after, and why all that might be.</p> 

<p>These observations make up the theory in this book, which are grounded in day-to-day experiences.</p>

<img 
class="center-if-screen-is-small"
src="images/about/smiling-intensities.png"
title="More preview examples"
alt="This figure previews the sort of analysis used in the rest of this book. The title is 'Smile,' and a picture of a man giving a very small, frustrated smile and a woman beaming. Beneath is a spectrum graph from less intense to more intense, with a note that smiles have a scale of intensity."
style="max-width: 20rem;">
 
<p>I think of these observations as a kind of "fieldwork." A lot of interesting studies of humor are more like "bookwork"—they're structural analysis of comedies or satires, and aren't always grounded on the experiences of people. They also tends to leans toward <em>description</em> <callback>("the eight kinds of jokes")</callback> rather than <term>explanation</term> <callback>("the process of why we laugh at things in general")</callback> </p>

<p>In my experience, "explanation + fieldwork" fast tracks us to the central mysteries of humor, and brings us face-to-face with the questions about humor that are hardest, most interesting, and most productive.
</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Research</h2>

<p>I did relatively little secondary research on humor for this book. In many ways, it's an independent look at things.</p>
  
<p>That means this book is <em>not</em> a good way to be introduced to academic or professional scholarship on humor and humor-adjacent topics—whether psychological, computational, neurological, or so on. This has upsides and downsides, depending on your goals.</p>

<p>The notable academic resource that I did use for this book was Warren Shibles' <i>Online Humor Reference Guide</i>—without question one of the weirdest books ever written. I'm grateful Shibles' book zapped my brain with its rays at an impressionable age. It set me on a path of humor-thinking in high school, which I've been running down since.</p>

<div class="about-box">
    <p>In some ways, humor is the world's <em>best</em> and <term>most interesting</term> puzzle. How do we explain the most, most elegantly? We solve this by collecting clues from our day-to-day lives.</p>
    
    <p>This makes a study of humor feel familiar, expected, unlocking, and surprising—all at once. It's like an equally-balanced certainty matrix: regarding humor, there are <term>known</term> <term>knowns</term>, <term>known</term> <em>unknowns</em>, <em>unknown</em> <term>knowns</term>, and <em>unknown</em> <em>unknowns</em>.</p> 
    
    <p>A study of humor mingles all these things together more than perhaps any other subject. It's not new—we have endless observations and experiences—we just haven't always put everything on the table. When we do so, it's a bit like unfolding our life for re-examination and puzzle-solving.</p>
</div>


<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Everyone should learn about humor</h2>

<p>You should learn more about humor. It doesn't matter if you're "good" or "bad" at humor—because <em>everyone</em> should know more about humor.</p>
  
<!--  
<p>When we <em>don't</em> know analytical and applied humor methods, all sorts of bad things happen.</p> 

<p>On a <em>collective</em> level, we end up in groups that are unable to create joyful experiences—as anyone who has taken a joyless class or attended a joyless meeting can attest.</p>

<p>On an <em>individual</em> level, we end up with difficulties of action and decisions—as anyone who has felt awkward around new people or in conversation can attest.</p> 
  -->

<p>  Humor substantially contributes to our "<term>aura of ability</term>"—our collective ability to:

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>form acquaintances and grow closer to them</li>
    <li>to make successful arguments</li>
    <li>to ask for and give aid</li>
    <li>to interpret situations</li>
    <li>to create</li>
    <li>to be resilient</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>These are things we never finish improving at. Which is why everyone should learn about humor.</p>

<!--And the resources to do so should be clear, accessible, coherent, practical, straightforward, and so on—like what's attempted in this book.-->


<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">It's almost time to start</h2>

<p>Look, I'm so excited you're about to start! I've had a wonderful time putting this book together—doing so has certainly changed my own life. It's my hope that re-encountering humor provides you with long-lasting strength and wonder as well.</p>

     <a href="index.html#exclude-navigation"><button class="table-of-contents" style="margin-top: 1rem;">Start <i>The Humor Book!</i></button></a>

   
   
<p>Hey! I'm Hadrian, the author of this book—welcome! I'm a humor theorist, with a specific interest in <em>teaching</em> humor.</p> 

<img class="center-if-screen-is-small"
 src="images/about/hadrian.jpg"
title="The author, Hadrian"
 alt="This is a portrait of the author smiling."
style="max-width: 17rem;" >

<p>A lot of books about humor are abstract, confusing, incoherent, narrow, or weird—and are often more interested in <em>describing</em> humor than teaching it. </p> 

<p>So I started <i>The Humor Book</i> as a clean course, which takes enough time to convey the full elegance of humor—point A to point B, without fluff or shortcuts</p>

<p>Putting everything together is a lot of fun! In many ways, coming to understand humor feels a bit like solving the world's best and most interesting puzzle. It's something engaging, all the way through.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">The elephant in the room</h2> 

<p>One of the challenges to learning about humor is just how <em>big</em> it is. It's a bit like the story of the Blind Mice and the Elephant. The blind mice come across a mysterious object, and each touch it to see what it is:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>One blind mouse runs up the leg and says <callback>“it’s a tree trunk!”</callback></li> 
        <li>Another goes up the tail, and says <callback>“it’s a rope!”</callback></li> 
        <li>The last clambers around the ear and says <callback>“it’s a curtain!”</callback></li>
        
        </ul>

<p>This is like humor! At different times, we've probably come across humor as:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>sometimes <strong><i>comedy</i></strong>, sometimes <strong><i>tragedy</i></strong></li>
        <li>sometimes <strong><i>frivolous</i></strong>, sometimes <strong><i>important</i></strong></li>
        <li>sometimes <strong><i>mean</i></strong>, sometimes <strong><i>kind</i></strong></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <strong><i>anxiety</i></strong>, sometimes to <strong><i>confidence</i></strong></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <strong><i>shame</i></strong>, sometimes to <strong><i>pride</i></strong></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <strong><i>failure</i></strong>, sometimes to <strong><i>success</i></strong></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <strong><i>jokes</i></strong>, sometimes to <strong><i>straight-talk</i></strong></li>
        <li>sometimes about <strong><i>lies</i></strong>, sometimes about <strong><i>truth</i></strong></li>
        <li>sometimes about <strong><i>randomness</i></strong>, and sometimes about <strong><i>insight</i></strong></li>
        </ul> 

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>What sort of elephant is this? In some ways, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle in front of us, but no box—how to we fit everything together?</p> 

<p>Putting things harmoniously together is something we'll be doing throughout this book. And we'll eventually be able to step back and finally see the whole picture of humor clearly.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Dispelling myths</h2>

<p>Along the way, we'll be freeing ourselves of some of the baggage we have about humor—a bunch of myths we don't always question, but don't quite make sense when actually laid out in sunlight.</p>

<p>These myths are probably pretty familiar to us:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
       <li><em>I</em> haven't been <em>taught</em> humor before. Therefore, humor <em>can't</em> be taught.</li>
        <li>Some people seem <em>naturally</em> funny. Therefore, <em>I</em> can't become funnier.</li> 
        <li><em>Comedians</em> are funny. Therefore, comedians are the standard to which <em>everyone</em> should be compared to, humorwise.</li>
        <li><em>Some</em> humor seems trivializing. Therefore, <em>all</em> humor is trivializing.</li>
        <li>We <em>sometimes</em> laugh at jokes. Therefore <em>everything</em> we laugh at is a joke.</li>
        <li>Funny <em>movies</em> sometimes have clever and witty scripts. Therefore, to make people laugh, <em>I</em> have to be clever and witty, like a script.
    </li>
        </ul>
    
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>These informal logic fallacies can cause us a lot of trouble, so we'll be taking some time to iron these out. By untying these knots in our thinking, we'll find our thinking about humor becomes much lighter, truer, and more powerful.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">This is a course on humor</h2> 

<p>Some humor books are fun because they expertly tell anecdotes in an amusing style. This humor book is fun because it's a textbook. You know what I mean? </p>

<img 
class="center-if-screen-is-small"
  src="images/6c-images-topics/6-6-topics-track-mistakes-and-oks-not-humor/6-6-1-generating-humor-houseplant.png" 
title="Example of an image"
alt="This graph previews the kind of analysis used in the rest of this book. It shows a a graph with two unlabled axes and two obscure measures, a title 'houseplant' and two markers: 'A. We give our houseplant a name' and 'B. We decide our houseplant is a reincarnated pine.'"

style="max-width: 15rem;">

<p>This book is a <em>course</em>: it teaches something—an analytical model of humor. Then it expands this model into an observational system to make sense of what's happening around us, and why.</p> 

<p>We'll use this model as a methodology for producing smiles and laughs—and as a tool we can use to draw inferences about what the absence or presence of laughter means about people, events, and places.</p>

<p>We'll go over all this at a pace and sequence that genuinely allows us the learn these things. We won't just talk <em>about</em> them, but actually <em>learn</em> them—by using thousands of vignettes, hundreds of graphs, dozens of case studies, and plenty of picture and video examples.</p> 

<p>The goal is to finish the course fully comfortable with an elegant, organized, and productive worldview of humor.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">My fieldwork on humor</h2>

<p>Over the years, I've been an after school teacher, barista, canvasser, cashier, dance teacher, event coordinator, facilitator, greeter, tutor, and so on. In each of these positions, you sink or swim on your ability to generate smiles and laughs!

<p>So, in short, everyone should learn about humor. And the resources to do so should be clear, accessible, coherent, practical, straightforward, and so on—like what's attempted in this book.</p>
