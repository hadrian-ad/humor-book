Scales of description 
</h1>


<p>At this point, we’ve gone over the four interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor. These are humor at different scales of looking—from the highest scale of our general word “humor,” to the smallest scale of “mistakes and OKs”:</p> 

<h2>Scales of Humor</h2>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Humor as an overall pattern (“humor”)</li>
    <li>Humor as experiences (humor family words)</li>
    <li>Humor as intentions or consequences (humor outcomes)</li>
    <li>Humor as expressive behavior (humor tells)</li>
    <li>Humor as information-assessments (mistakes and OKs)</li>
    </ul>

 
<p>These different scales of humor are all happening at the same time. We choose between which scale to use based on what’s useful to us.</p>

<p>To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>:</p>

 

<p>Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word like <emotions>relief</emotions>:</p>



<p>This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or just the word humor:</p>

    <p>These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to our intuitive understanding. Sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales for a greater range of perspective.</p>
