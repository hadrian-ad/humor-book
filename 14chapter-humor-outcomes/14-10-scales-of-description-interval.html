Scales of description 
</h1>


At this point, we’ve gone over the four interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor. These are humor at different scales of looking—from the highest scale of our general word “humor,” to the smallest scale of “mistakes and OKs”: 

Scales of Humor

Humor as an overall pattern (“humor”)
Humor as experiences (humor family words)
Humor as intentions or consequences (humor outcomes)
Humor as expressive behavior (humor tells)
Humor as information-assessments (mistakes and OKs)

 
These different scales of humor are all happening at the same time. We choose between which scale to use based on what’s useful to us. 

To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome:

 

Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word like relief:



 This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or just the word humor:



Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title: “Wherever You Go, There You Are.”  

She thinks about that for a second, puzzled. Then something clicks, and she gives an amused nose-exhale. (&larr;a mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;laughs&harr;&#xFE0E;gain a new perspective&harr;&#xFE0E;insight, realization&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)

-

Assessments (mistakes and OKs)&harr;&#xFE0E;behavior (humor tells)&harr;&#xFE0E;actions (humor outcomes)&harr;&#xFE0E;states (humor family word)&harr;&#xFE0E;overall pattern (humor)



Santiago and Damien are walking through the halls.

Santiago: “Well. We lost every game but two this season. I feel like that’s some kind of achievement!”

Damien: *laughs* “Uh-huh, sure man.” (&larr;mistakes are OK&harr;&#xFE0E;laughs,  brightens, loosening, smiling, focusing on present, raised spirits, social integration&harr;&#xFE0E;argument was supported, created rapport, eased tension, gained new perspectives, been acceptably criticized, symbolized close ties&harr;&#xFE0E;acceptance, connection, self-forgiveness, insight, self-reconciliation, release, relief, success&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)

-

Assessments (mistakes and OKs)&harr;&#xFE0E;behavior (humor tells)&harr;&#xFE0E;actions (humor outcomes)&harr;&#xFE0E;states (humor family word)&harr;&#xFE0E;overall pattern (humor)

These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to our intuitive understanding. Sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales for a greater range of perspective.
