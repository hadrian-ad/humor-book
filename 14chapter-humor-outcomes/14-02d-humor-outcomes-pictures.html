Humor outcomes add context to the word humor

    <p>Sometimes we use <term>one</term> humor outcome to describe humor:</p>

<p>We can use several humor outcomes to describe the presence or absence of humor in different situations:</p>

    <p>In specific situations, some humor outcomes will feel like poetic or loose descriptions, while other humor outcomes will feel conventional or precise. We'll usually stick with the conventional or precise descriptions for concision and intuitive clarity.</p> 
     
     <p>Even so, sometimes using more humor outcomes help us see emotional situations in new light and give greater us greater dimensionality of our thinking of specific moments of humor.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="chapter-end">
    <p>That's the end of this chapter! Next, we'll look at the "appropriateness" of humor.</p>

   A deeper look (Scales of humor)
    
    </button>
        
<div class="content-example">  
    
    <p>At this point, we’ve gone over the five interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor. These are different scales of looking at humor—from the <term>highest</term> scale of our general word “humor,” to the <em>smallest</em> scale of “mistakes and OKs”:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Humor as an overall pattern <callback>(“humor”)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as experiences <callback>(humor family words)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as intentions or consequences <callback>(humor outcomes)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as expressive behavior <callback>(humor tells)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as information-assessments <callback>(mistakes and OKs)</callback></li>
    </ul>
    
         <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-0-pyramid.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

 
<p>These different scales of humor are all happening at the same time. We choose between which scale to use based on what’s useful to us.</p>

<p>To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>:</p>

      <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-1-tells-into-outcomes.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 22rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word like <emotions>relief</emotions>:</p>

     <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-2-outcomes-into-family-word.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or just the word humor:</p>

    <p>These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to our intuitive understanding. And sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales for a greater range of perspective.</p>
