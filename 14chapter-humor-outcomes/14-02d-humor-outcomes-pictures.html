Humor outcomes add context to the word humor

    <p>We can use <term>one</term> humor outcome to describe the presence or absence of humor, but we can also use <em>many</em>:</p>

      <p>Above, instead of saying Emma <term>only</term> <humor-outcome>avoids conflict (by postponing it)</humor-outcome>, we can <em>also</em> say she reaches a few different humor outcomes—she <humor-outcome>handled complaints (by avoiding them)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>eased (her own) tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<p>Above, Sam and Jennifer feel the sign <humor-outcome>supports an argument (about how to behave around goats)</humor-outcome>, while Riley doesn't.</p>
