Humor outcomes describe arrangements of mistakes and OKs
</h1>

<div class="listbox">
    <p class="listbox-headline">Humor outcomes</p>
    <p><i>acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, <strong>gain new perspectives</strong>, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</i></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>A humor outcome is the same thing as humor:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title: <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are.</book-title></narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>She thinks about that for a second, puzzled. Then something clicks, and she gives an amused nose-exhale.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;a mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<humor-outcome>Zoe gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    </div>
            
<p>Above, we're describing the same thing in three interchangeable ways:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Zoe feels humor</li>
    <li>Zoe's evaluates a mistake and OK as balancing</li>
    <li>Zoe <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome> <notes>(&larr;humor described as its outcome)</notes></li>
    </ul>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem ; margin-left: 2rem " 
     >

<p>We could use any of the descriptions above to talk about Zoe's humor. We pick between them based on what's helpful.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">We can use humor outcomes to talk about humor in narrative and tangible ways.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We don't convey any situational context when we say Zoe "felt humor" or that she "evaluated a mistake as balanced with an OK." We can include context by instead saying she <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>.</p> </div>


<div class="box">

          <p><headline>Sameness.</headline> At first, it can seem odd to say humor outcomes like <humor-outcome>gain a new perspetive</humor-outcome> <sem>is</sem> humor. But we've already seen how this is humor in our chapter on <a href="../7chapter-humor-family-words/7-1-realization-as-humor.html">humor family words</a>.</p>
          
          <p>In that chapter, we looked at how words like <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on <sem>are</sem> humor. These words are very similar to phrases like <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>.
          </p> 
        
    <p>In other words, when Zoe <humor-outcome>gains a new perspetive</humor-outcome>, she's feeling <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on&mdash;she's feeling humor.</p>
       
       
         
           
         <!--  
           <p>The benefit of <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is how intuitive and narratively familiar it is. A word like "insight" is abstract, while a phrase like "gain a new perspective" is more tangible.</p>
