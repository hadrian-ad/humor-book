Humor outcomes help us characterize humor
</h1>  

<p>Sometimes, we feel humor towards things that seem random—and this randomness can make it feel imprecise to use humor outcomes.</p>

<p>In these case, we can simply start  with the generic umbrella of <term>evaluating a mistake as OK:</term></p>

 

<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to use humor outcomes when they don’t feel useful)</notes></p>

    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Ferdydurke. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to use humor outcomes when they don’t feel useful)</notes></p>

    </div>

<p>Titles like <i>If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler</i>, <i>Cryptonomicon</i>, <i>Ferdydurke</i>, and so on deviate from our expectations by just being random—not by directly <humor-outcome>dealing with taboo topics</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>.
    </p>
    
<p>At the same time, we can still describe something like <i>Ferdydurke</i> with humor outcomes: Zoe felt the title <humor-outcome>created rapport (with her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation (like how she spent her attention)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supported an argument (about what the book will be like)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave her new perspective (about how books can be titled),</humor-outcome> and so on.</p>
   
   <p>We often feel there's a lot happening in moments of humor, but it can be hard to describe what that means, exactly. Humor outcomes can help us feel and describe the texture and dimensionality to these moments of humor.</p>


 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Push.</headline> When Zoe reads the title <i>In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948</i> she may describe the title as dark or grim—and she may not feel humor. But even so, she can also recognize something humorous about the title.</p> 
    
    <p>What makes something "humorous"? We can use humor outcomes to think about this—the author or publishers were intending readers to feel <humor-outcome>an argument was supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives were given</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>something was acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>When Zoe thinks she sees these intentions, she describes the vehicle for them as "humorous." That doesn't mean she <term>feels</term> humor. It just means she sees the <em>push</em> toward humor outcomes. In this way, we can describe a variety of things as humorous, even if we find the appalling, unfunny, or unrelated to jokes.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, it's not odd that we may pick up on mixed intentions. An editor may hope we find that a title <humor-outcome>supports an argument</humor-outcome>—even at the same time they hope we find it severe. There's nothing strange about an editor trying to make us feel mistake-predominant emotions and humor simultaneously.</p>

 <p>We can explain a family's humor with mistakes and OKs. They didn't expect to see a sign like this <callback>(a mistake)</callback>, and it didn't have personal consequences for them <callback>(it's OK)</callback>.</p>
 
 <p>To dig deeper, we can use our list of humor outcomes. How would some of them apply, even in poetic or non-standard ways?</p>
 
 <p>In what way is their humor showing something was <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>tensions were eased</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>new perspectives were found</humor-outcome>, that a <humor-outcome>personality trait was revealed</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>close ties were symbolized?</humor-outcome></p>
 
 <p>The goal is to spark personal insight. Evaluations are tied from people to the world around them. Humor is an expression of this relation. Like wires wound together, these relations can be hard to pick apart and make sense of. Humor outcomes help us do this.</p>

<p>We can always use mistakes and OKs to explain why Zoe and Emma felt humor. <callback>("The poster deviated from Zoe's expectations, and she felt equally secure from negative personal consequences.")</callback></p>

<p>At the same time, this generic language can obscure aspects of this humor that we intuitively feel is happening. To cast a net for these aspects, we can use humor outcomes.</p>

<p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma's humor <humor-outcome>created rapport (among themselves, with the sign, with the establishment, and so on)</humor-outcome>; <humor-outcome>gave a new perspective (that's hard to put into words exactly)</humor-outcome>; the sign's design, location, mood, sentiment, tone, vibe, and so on <humor-outcome>reveals a personal view (of the artist, establishment, or viewer)</humor-outcome>; and so on.</p>
