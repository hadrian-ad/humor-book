Humor outcomes help us characterize humor
</h1>  

<p>Sometimes, no humor outcomes seem precise. In these case, we can simply start  with the generic umbrella of a mistake and OK balancing:</p>

 

<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to start with humor outcomes when that doesn't feel useful)</notes></p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Cryptonomicon. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to start with humor outcomes when that doesn't feel useful</notes></p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Ferdydurke. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to start with humor outcomes when that doesn't feel useful</notes></p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Handy Andy. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to start with humor outcomes when that doesn't feel useful</notes></p>
    </div>

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs in these cases to get a clearer initial orientation to Zoe's humor.</p>
  
<p>Then, we're ready to move into thinking about humor outcomes, which often aren't initially obvious.</p>
  
   <div class="for-instance">
       <p class="for-instance">For instance</p>
          
       <p class="for-instance-text">
              It's easy to see how titles like <i>If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler</i>, <i>Cryptonomicon</i>, <i>Ferdydurke</i>, and so on deviate from our expectations, and don't have risk of personal negative consequences for most readers.</p>
              
              <p class="for-instance-text">What's less easy to see is these title's relation to   <humor-outcome>dealing with taboo topics</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome> relative to a title like  <i>The Book Book of Masturbation: From Angst to Zeal</i> does.
          </p>
          </div> 
          
<p>We can still describe something like <i>Ferdydurke</i> with humor outcomes: Zoe felt the title <humor-outcome>created rapport (with her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation (like how she spent her attention)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supported an argument (about what the book will be like)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave her new perspective (about how books can be titled),</humor-outcome> and so on.</p>
   
<p>When we use humor outcomes&mdash;even for something as "random" as <i>Ferdydurke</i>&mdash;we start understanding what's actually happening in an emotional situation.</p>   
   
<div class="consider">  
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">We often feel that a lot happens in moments of humor&mdash;that there's complexity that's hard for us to describe.</p>
      
    <p class="considertext">Humor outcomes help us describe the texture and dimensionality to humor, and see more how people are relating to things around them.</p>
       </div>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Push.</headline> Zoe may not feel humor when she reads the title <i>In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948</i> —and may even describe the title as dark or grim. But even so, she can also recognize something humorous about the title.</p> 
    
    <p>We can use humor outcomes to think about what makes something "humorous"—the author or publishers were intending readers to feel <humor-outcome>an argument was supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives were given</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>something was acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>When Zoe thinks she sees these intentions, she describes the vehicle for those intentions as "humorous." That doesn't mean she <term>feels</term> humor. It just means she sees the <em>push</em> toward humor outcomes. In this way, we can describe a variety of things as humorous, even if we find the appalling, unfunny, or unrelated to jokes.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, it's not odd that we may pick up on <sem>mixed</sem> intentions. An editor may hope we find that a title <humor-outcome>supports an argument</humor-outcome>—even at the same time they hope we find it severe. There's nothing strange about an editor trying to make us feel both mistake-predominant emotions and humor simultaneously.</p>

  <p>To practice using humor outcomes, we can look at some case studies.</p>

 <p>We can explain a family's humor with mistakes and OKs. They didn't expect to see a sign like this <callback>(a mistake)</callback>, and it didn't have personal consequences for them <callback>(it's OK)</callback>.</p>
 
 <p>To dig deeper, we can use our list of humor outcomes. How would some humor outcomes apply, even in poetic or non-standard ways?</p>
 
 <p>This leads to specific questions, like: in what way is their humor showing something was <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>tensions were eased</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>new perspectives were found</humor-outcome>, that a <humor-outcome>personality trait was revealed</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>close ties were symbolized?</humor-outcome></p>
 
<p>The goal of asking these questions is to spark personal insight ino the emotional situation.</p> 
 
<p>Evaluations are ties from people to the world around them. Humor is a relational expression of this ties. Like wires that are wound together, these relations can be hard to pick apart and make sense of&mdash;but humor outcomes makes doing this much easier.</p>

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain why Zoe and Emma felt humor. <callback>("The poster deviated from Zoe's expectations, and she felt equally secure from negative personal consequences.")</callback></p>

<p>At the same time, this generic language can obscure aspects of the emotional situation that we intuitively feel is happening. To cast a net for these aspects, we can use humor outcomes.</p>

<p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma's humor <humor-outcome>created rapport (among themselves, with the sign, with the establishment, and so on)</humor-outcome>; <humor-outcome>gave a new perspective (that's hard to put into words exactly)</humor-outcome>; the sign's design, location, mood, sentiment, tone, vibe, and so on <humor-outcome>reveals a personal view (of the artist, establishment, or viewer)</humor-outcome>; and so on.</p>

                <speaker>Obama:</speaker> <speech>"But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works. You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916."</speech> <internalaction>(irritated)</internalaction> <speech>"Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets&mdash;because the nature of our military's changed."</speech></p>
                <p>
                    <speaker>Audience:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action>
                </p>
            
            </div>
     
    <p>How we describe Obama's statement is irrelevant when talking about humor&mdash;we don't need to spend time thinking about the word "joke" to think about why the audience laughed.</p> 
    
    <p>Instead, we can simply say the audience laughed because they felt Obama <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave new perspective</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieved catharsis</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This lets us understand the relation between the statement and the audience in a way that explains humor&mdash;without getting bogged down in trying to categorize speech.</p> 
    
<p>Some people thought Obama's continuation was meanspirited to Romney:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Obama:</speaker> <internalaction>(derisively)</internalaction> <speech>"We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." <internalaction>(regaining composure)</internalaction>  "And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities."</speech></p></div>
    
<p>Let's say someone thought this was mean, not funny. What was different here than moments before?</p>

<p>Again, we can use humor outcomes. Someone who thought Obama went too far thought he didn't <humor-outcome><term>acceptably</term> criticize</humor-outcome>, but <em>unacceptably</em> criticized, didn't <humor-outcome><term>support</term> an argument</humor-outcome>, but <em>undermined</em> an argument, and so on.</p> 
  
<p>As before, <sem>how</sem> we describe the comment doesn't matter <callback>(mocking, arguing, teasing, angry, joking, and so on)</callback>since those are outcome non-specific&mdash;those don't explain or indicate who would or wouldn't laugh in a given situation. Instead, we can simply say that viewer didn't feel any humor outcomes were reached&mdash;and so no humor was felt.</p>
