14.4 We don’t have to use humor outcomes if they don’t feel accurate
  

Sometimes, we feel humor at a book title because it's so random—and this randomness seems to prevent any humor outcomes from feeling precise.

In this case, we don’t need to use humor outcomes—we can just use the generic umbrella of evaluating a mistake as OK:

 

Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler. She smiles. (&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to use humor outcomes if they don’t feel useful)

 

Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Cryptonomicon. She smiles. (&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to use humor outcomes if they don’t feel useful)

 

Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Ferdydurke. She smiles. (&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to use humor outcomes if they don’t feel useful)

 

Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Handy Andy. She smiles. (&larr;Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;we don’t need to use humor outcomes if they don’t feel useful) 

Titles like If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler, Cryptonomicon, Ferdydurke, and so on deviate from our expectations by just being random—not by immediately dealing with taboo topics or supporting an argument.

Since humor outcomes are just something we use for convenience, we can always skip them if they don’t feel helpful. We can just say that Zoe felt humor at a title like Ferdydurke because she evaluated a mistake and OK as balancing.

> Consider:

At the same time, we'll still often find it useful to describe Ferdydurke with humor outcomes: Zoe felt the title created rapport (with her), controlled a situation (like how she spent her attention), supported an argument (about what the book will be like), gave her new perspective (about how books can be titled), and so on.

 
We often feel there's a lot happening in moments of humor, but struggle to describe what that means, exactly. Humor outcomes can help us feel and describe the texture and dimensionality to these moments of humor.



 

 

Push. When Zoe reads the title In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948 she may feel confusion, boredom, disapproval, fear, vagueness, upset, or so on. She may describe the title as dark or grim. But even so, she can also recognize something humorous about the title. 
What makes something "humorous"? We can use humor outcomes to think about this—the author or publishers were intending readers feel an argument was supported, new perspectives were given, something was acceptably criticized, and so on. 

When Zoe thinks she sees these intentions, she describes the vehicle for them as "humorous." That doesn't mean she feels humor. It just means she sees the push toward humor outcomes. In this way, we can describe a variety of things as humorous, without feeling stuck on the word joke.

Finally, it's not odd that we may pick up on mixed intentions. An editor may hope we find a title supports an argument—even at the same time they hope we find it severe. There's nothing strange about an editor trying to make us feel mistake-predominant emotions and humor simultaneously.
