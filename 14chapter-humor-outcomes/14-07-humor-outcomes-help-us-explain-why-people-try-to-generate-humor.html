Humor outcomes help us explain why people try to generate humor 
</h1>


<p>We can use humor outcomes to think not just about why we feel humor <term>ourselves</term>—but also about why we try to make <em>others</em> feel humor in the first place.</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Santiago and Damien are walking through the halls.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Santiago:</speaker> <speech>“Well. We lost every game but two this season. I feel like that’s some kind of achievement!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Damien:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Uh-huh, sure man.”</speech></p> 
    
    </div>
    
    <p>To make narrative or motivational sense of why this humor is here, we can pick humor outcomes that seem to clearly describe this situation. </p>

<p>We might say that Santiago and Damien <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>changed negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome>symbolized close ties</humor-outcome>.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We could use other humor outcomes too. If Santiago and Damien had never brought up their losing streak before, we could describe Santiago as trying to <humor-outcome>deal with (mildly) taboo topics</humor-outcome> and to <humor-outcome>open new topics of conversation</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    </div>
    
    <p>Since trying to <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is a normal thing for people to do, we can set everything into a normal and understandable system of motivations and goals.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>File compression.</headline> Last chapter, we said that <a href="../13chapter-evaluatory-information/13-0-evaluatory-information.html">evaluatory information</a> increased information density—that emotions let us say more with less. We can see this by imagining Santiago and Damien as surreally emotionless. This decreases the information density of their speech—requiring more words to say the same things:</p>
    <div class="vignette">
            <p><speaker>Santiago:</speaker> <internalaction>(rationally)</internalaction> <speech>"I am going to make an argument: I think it’s time we stop remembering our season as being a negative experience. Now that it’s in the past, we can clearly see it wasn’t as consequential as it felt at the time. Instead, we should treat it as an experience that, if accepted, can give us a new perspective on the relative importance of success—and on the relation of our feelings to objective conclusions.”</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Damien:</speaker> <speech>“Interesting. I am not yet convinced, but the premise merits further thought.”</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Santiago:</speaker> <speech>“Also, given that the median win/loss ratio was higher than ours, it’s not literally wrong to call our season exceptional—just maybe not exactly in a way that brings conventional prestige.”</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Damien:</speaker> <action>*thinks it over*</action> <speech>“Yes. I am in partial concurrence, although I think you purposely downplay counterpoints.”</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Santiago:</speaker> <speech>“I am glad you partially concur. Does this show close ties?”</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Damien:</speaker> <speech>“Yes.”</speech></p> 
            </div>
            
    <p>The real Santiago and Damien communicated all this in just a few words! That's because they increased the information density of the interaction by adding evaluatory information <callback>(humor tells)</callback>—and so their humor made the exchange more efficient.</p>
    
    <p>This increased efficiency is why we sometimes find communication that involves humor to be dense, effective, incisive, light, memorable, multilayered, quick, and so on. By contrast, when people try to remove or preclude humor, we sometimes find their communication to be ponderous, ineffective, off-putting, and so on.</p>
