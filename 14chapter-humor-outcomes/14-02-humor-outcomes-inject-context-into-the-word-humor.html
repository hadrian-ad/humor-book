    <p class="listbox-headline">Humor outcomes</p>
    <p><i>acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</i></p>

<p>Humor outcomes are interchangeable with the emotion of humor. That’s because humor outcomes are like a descriptive skin we can put over "balanced mistakes and OKs":</p>
