14. Humor Outcomes 
</h1>


<p>In this chapter, weâ€™ll look at <vocab>humor outcomes</vocab>. These are ways of re-describing <callback>"balancing mistakes and OKs"</callback> as actions or outcomes.</p>

<p>For instance, we can call some situations where our mistakes and OKs balance as "gain a new perspective." This means <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is a humor outcome:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title: <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are.</book-title></narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>She thinks about that for a second, puzzled. Then something clicks, and she gives an amused nose-exhale.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;a mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<humor-outcome>Zoe gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
<p>Above, we're describing the same thing in three interchangeable ways:</p>

<ol class="close-list">
   <li>Zoe feels humor</li>
    <li>Zoe's evaluation of a mistake and OK balance</li>
    <li>Zoe <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome> <notes>(&larr;humor described as its outcome)</notes></li>
    </ol>

<p>The humor outcome bundles more situational context and narrative clarity. This gives us a narratively intuitive way of talking and thinking about humor.</p>


<div class="consider">

          <p class="considertext">At first, it can seem odd to say <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is the <sem>same</sem> thing as humor. But we've already seen how they are the same&mdash;we looked at how <a href="../7chapter-humor-family-words/7-1-realization-as-humor.html">humor family words</a> like <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on are humor.
           </p>
           
           <p class="considertext">When we say Zoe <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, we're talking about <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on by other means&mdash;for the same reason these humor family words are humor, <humor-outcome>gaining a new perspective</humor-outcome> is humor.</p> 
           
         <!--  
           <p>The benefit of <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is how intuitive and narratively familiar it is. A word like "insight" is abstract, while a phrase like "gain a new perspective" is more tangible.</p>
      -->
       
       </div>


<p>We'll be talking about humor outcomes in the rest of this chapter.</p>
