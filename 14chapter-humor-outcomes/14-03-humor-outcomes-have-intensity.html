Humor outcomes have intensity 
</h1>

<p>  The <term>intensity</term> of <term>humor</term> is the <em>intensity</em> of the <em>humor outcome</em>.</p> 
   
  <p>So we can have a <term>low</term>-intensity of <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome>, or a <em>high</em>-intensity of <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>When Emma dodges down the hall, she reaches a few different humor outcomes—she <humor-outcome>avoided conflict (by postponing it)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints (by avoiding them)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>eased (her own) tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, and so on. But since her humor wasn’t particularly long-lasting or intense, Emma didn’t <sem>intensely</sem> feel she <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>.</p>

<p>By contrast, if Emma realizes there had <sem>never</sem> been any potential conflict—so that she feels she <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>completely</outcome-contrast> avoided conflict</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>completely</outcome-contrast> eased (her own) tension</humor-outcome>—she feels more intense humor for longer.</p>

<div class="box">
    
    <p><headline>Modification.</headline> We can change the language of a humor outcome to reflect its intensity. So a phrase like <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> changes by intensity.</p> 
    
    <p >At <term>low-intensity</term> humor, someone may just <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast><term>somewhat influence</term></outcome-contrast> a situation</humor-outcome> and just <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast><term>reduce</term></outcome-contrast> conflict</humor-outcome>.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>But at <em>high-intensity</em> humor, someone may <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast><em>completely</em></outcome-contrast> control a situation</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast><em>completely</em></outcome-contrast> avoid conflict</humor-outcome>.</p>
     
     <p>To keep things readable, we'll generally use static phrases for humor outcomes  in this book. So we'll say someone <humor-outcome>achieves catharsis</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>&mdash;even if it's just a small smile, and better described in milder phrasing, like <humor-outcome>achieving <outcome-contrast>mild</outcome-contrast> catharsis</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>somewhat influencing</outcome-contrast> a situation</humor-outcome>.</p>

    <!--
    <p>At the same time, <sem>all</sem> humor outcomes always describe <sem>all</sem> moments of humor in a loose, poetic sense—like how <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to something like <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>—or how <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>—or how <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>—and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>These phrases interlock and overlap because they’re different ways of describing the same thing: humor.</p>
