Humor outcomes have intensity 
</h1>

<p>The intensity of <term>humor</term> is the intensity of the <em>humor outcome</em>. So we can have a high-intensity of <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome>, or a low-intensity of <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>When Emma dodges down the hall, she reaches a few different humor outcomes—she <humor-outcome>avoided conflict (by postponing it)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints (by avoiding them)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>eased (her own) tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, and so on. But since her humor wasn’t particularly long-lasting or intense, Emma didn’t <sem>intensely</sem> feel she <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>.</p>

<p>By contrast, when Emma realizes there had <sem>never</sem> been any potential conflict—so that she feels she <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>completely</outcome-contrast> avoided conflict</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>completely</outcome-contrast> eased (her own) tension</humor-outcome>—she feels more intense humor for longer.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We can change the language of a humor outcome to reflect its intensity. So a phrase like "control a situation" changes by intensity.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">At <term>low-intensity</term> humor, someone may just <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>somewhat influence</outcome-contrast> a situation</humor-outcome>. But at <em>high-intensity</em> humor, someone may <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>completely</outcome-contrast> control a situation</humor-outcome>.</p>
     
    <p class="considertext">Similarly, at <term>low-intensity</term> humor, we we may just <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>reduce</outcome-contrast> conflict</humor-outcome>—while at <em>high-intensity</em> humor we may say we <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>completely</outcome-contrast> avoid conflict.</humor-outcome></p>

    <p><headline>Overlap.</headline> Our humor outcomes all overlap with each other. Something like <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is similar to <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>. These humor outcomes all overlap because they’re all re-describing the same thing: humor!</p>

    <p>In specific situations, some humor outcomes will feel more precise descriptions than others, while others will feel more poetic or loose. We'll usually stick with the precise descriptions for intuitive clarity.</p> 
    
    <!--
    <p>At the same time, <sem>all</sem> humor outcomes always describe <sem>all</sem> moments of humor in a loose, poetic sense—like how <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to something like <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>—or how <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>—or how <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>—and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>These phrases interlock and overlap because they’re different ways of describing the same thing: humor.</p>
