Our evaluations change continuously 
</h1>




Humor outcomes
acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.

<p>Humor outcomes are interchangeable with the emotion of humor. That’s because humor outcomes are like a descriptive skin we can put over “evaluating mistakes as OK”:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>As Owen scrolls through his camera roll, he sees several similar photos on his phone. He looks at them for a while, and finally he closes out and laughs regretfully. “What a creeper. Ah, fuck me.” He feels lighter. Then he laughs again, feeling better. (&larr;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Owen achieved catharsis&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title: “Wherever You Go, There You Are.” </p>
    
    <p>She thinks about that for a second, puzzled. Then something clicks, and she gives an amused nose-exhale. A funny sort of realization. (&larr;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe gained a new perspective&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

    <p>Trevor: *shopping online* “Should we order it or not?”</p>
    
    <p>Yasmin: “I just can’t decide! I just love StormConQuest: The Board Game, but the reviews on the expansion are just so mixed. They say StormConQuest: Seas of Drake and Myrrh really overcomplicates the resource management. What if that ruins it?”</p>
    
    <p>Trevor: *out of the blue* “What do you think about having a kid?” (&larr;Trevor wants to open a new topic of conversation)</p>
    
    <p>Yasmin: *puts hand on face* *laughs* “Oh god, Trevor. That’s not StormConQuest!” (&larr;Yasmin feels mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Trevor opened a new topic of conversation&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>
    
    <p>Trevor: *laughs* “Not now obviously. Just spitballing here, random talk.” (&larr;Trevor feels mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Trevor feels he opened a new topic of conversation&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>Zoe comes in from the rain, and has to push against the door to close it against the wind. Inside, her apartment is calm and quiet, and the rain is spattering against the windows. “Phew!” Zoe says, laughing. (&larr;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe has changed negative emotions into positive ones&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>
    
    </div> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p>Sam is examining himself in the mirror, looking at his balding head. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm. “You look so handsome,” she says, squeezing him. (&larr;Jennifer wants to help Sam evaluate a mistake as OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Jennifer wants to ease tension, help Sam feel accepted, change Sam’s negative emotions into positive ones)</p>
    
    <p>Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs and leans against her affectionately. (&larr;Sam’s mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Sam’s tension has eased, Sam feels accepted, Sam’s negative emotions have changed into positive ones&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p> </div>

<p>When the emotion of humor is absent, there’s been no humor outcome: </p>

<h2>When humor is absent, humor outcomes are absent</h2>

    <p>As Owen scrolls through his camera roll, he sees several similar photos on his phone. He looks at them for a while, and finally he closes the app. “Ah, fuck me,” he says. He feels miserable. (&larr;mistake is not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Owen has not achieved catharsis&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>Zoe comes in from the rain and has to push against the door to close it against the wind. Inside, her apartment is small and cold, the harsh light of the nearby pharmacy shining into her window through the rain.</p>
    <p>“Oof,” Zoe says, dispirited. (&larr;mistake is not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe has not changed negative emotions into positive ones&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>

    <p>Trevor: *out of the blue* “What do you think about having a kid?” (&larr;Trevor wants to open a new topic of conversation)</p>
    
    <p>Yasmin: *sighs* “I don’t really think this is a good time to talk about this.” (&larr;mistake is not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Yasmin feels that Trever has not opened new topic of conversation&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>
    
    <p>Trevor: (pressing on) *lump in his throat* “But we don’t have to decide anything, I just thought we should, you know, spitball.” (&larr;Trevor continues to try to open a new topic of conversation, but doesn’t feel he has&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>
    
    <p>Yasmin: “Trevor. I don’t want to talk about this now.” (&larr;Yasmin feels that Trevor has not opened a new topic of conversation&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>

<p>We can also use humor outcomes as an overall description of the humor in a situation:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Xiaowei and Lina find Damien sitting by himself. “Want to come sit with us?” Xiaowei asks. Damien gathers his lunch bag and sits with them.</p>
    
    <p>Xiaowei and Lina are making each other laugh, and take time to explain some inside jokes to Damien. After a while, Damien starts smiling and showing humor tells. (&larr;Lina and Xiaowei help Damien become accepted&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>
    
    </div>



<p>We can use humor outcomes to describe Damien’s humor on a longer timescale: throughout the lunch period, Lina and Xiaowei were trying to help Damien become accepted. Since Damien was feeling humor, they were successful at making him feel acceptance.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Humor outcomes make it easier to talk about humor that happens collectively over longer periods of time. Without knowing anything that Lina, Xiaowei, and Damien said specifically, we can still say that, over the course of the period, they were trying to help Damien become accepted—and often succeeded.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think we need to dig through conversations sentence-by-sentence to discover what generates humor—but this isn’t always useful, since it sometimes obscures what’s happening more broadly in the situation. Humor outcomes help us see this broader picture.</p>
