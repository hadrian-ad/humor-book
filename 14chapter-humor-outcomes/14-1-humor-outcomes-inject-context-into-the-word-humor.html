Humor outcomes add context to the word humor

    <p class="listbox-headline">Humor outcomes</p>
    <p><i>acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</i></p>

<p>Humor outcomes are interchangeable with the emotion of humor. That’s because humor outcomes are like a descriptive skin we can put over <term>evaluating mistakes as OK</term>:</p>

    <p><narrative>As Owen scrolls through his camera roll, he sees several similar photos on his phone.

<p>When the emotion of humor is absent, there’s been no humor outcome: </p>

<p>We can also use humor outcomes as an overall description of the humor in a situation:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina find Damien sitting by himself.</narration> <speech>“Want to come sit with us?”</speech> <narration>Xiaowei asks. Damien gathers his lunch bag and sits with them.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina are making each other laugh, and take time to explain some inside jokes to Damien. After a while, Damien starts smiling and showing humor tells.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Lina and Xiaowei help Damien become accepted&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
    
    </div>



<p>We can use humor outcomes to describe Damien’s humor on a longer timescale: throughout the lunch period, Lina and Xiaowei were trying to <humor-outcome>help Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>. Since Damien was feeling humor, they were successful at making him feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Humor outcomes make it easier to talk about humor that happens collectively over longer periods of time. Without knowing anything that Lina, Xiaowei, and Damien said specifically, we can still say that, over the course of the period, they were trying to <humor-outcome>help Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>—and often succeeded.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think we need to dig through conversations sentence-by-sentence to discover what generates humor—but this isn’t always useful, since it sometimes obscures what’s happening more broadly in the situation. Humor outcomes help us see this broader picture.</p>
