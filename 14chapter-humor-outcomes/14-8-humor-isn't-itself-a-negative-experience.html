Humor isn't itself a negative experience 
</h1>


<p>Since humor can be present during moments of belittling, dehumanizing, mockery, and so on—we think that belittling and dehumanizing are possible outcomes of humor.</p>

<p>But if people are feeling shame, they're feeling shame—not humor. People who are feeling belittled aren’t feeling humor—they’re feeling belittled:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor comes into class and slips and falls, his cereal cup falling down his shirt. The entire class is at first shocked, but when they see he’s not hurt, start laughing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> </p>
    
    <p><narration>Bitter and unamused, Trevor stalks away to the bathroom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels shame when others feel humor)</notes></p> 
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma sees Owen selling candy in the hallway.</narration> <speech>“You’re selling candy?”</speech> <narration>Emma says. She laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> “What are you, a girl scout?”</p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen’s face burns.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen feels shame when others feel humor)</notes></p>
    
    </div>
    
<div class="vignette">    
        <p><narration>Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table and they look at him and laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speech>“Nice hat, man!”</speech> <narration>Emma says, admiringly. Owen is crushed. They had laughed.</narration> <speech>“Thanks,”</speech> <narration>he says, tingling with horror.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen feels shame when others feel humor)</notes></p>
        
        </div> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Middle school Emma is talking to Heather, her favorite teacher, when a passing student makes a witty comment about Emma’s buzzed head. Heather laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Emma feels weirdly crushed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels shame when others feel humor)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>When Heather laughs at the comment about Emma’s hair, Heather <humor-outcome>eased tension (with herself)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport (with the mocking student)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>thought the student revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on. Heather feels humor.</p> 

<p>But while <term>Heather</term> feels humor, <em>Emma</em> doesn’t feel humor—and so Emma doesn’t experience any humor outcomes. Instead, she experienced mistake-predominant emotional outcomes:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>instead of <humor-outcome>reduced defensiveness</humor-outcome>, Emma felt <humor-outcome><em>increased</em> defensiveness</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>instead of being <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, Emma felt she was <humor-outcome><em>unacceptably</em> criticized</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>instead of <humor-outcome>negative emotions turned into positive ones</humor-outcome>, Emma felt <humor-outcome>positive emotions turned into <em>negative</em> ones</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Emma felt mistake-predominant emotions, not humor. And even though the humor in this situation had bad overall outcomes, since it came at the expense of Emma’s well-being—we can still describe the emotion of humor in terms of “good” outcomes for <term>Heather</term>.</p> 

<p>In this way, humor can still be involved with negative situations, while also being described in positive terms for whoever feels humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Feeling humor isn’t a source of negative emotions, which is still true even in more severe situations—like if a group of kids circle around another kid and laugh as they push and mock them. The <em>harassers</em> are feeling humor, which can be described as positive humor outcomes for <em>them</em>.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">But the <term>target</term> or <term>observers</term> of the harassment aren’t themselves feeling humor. While their negative emotions may partly be in <term>reaction</term> to the humor felt by others, they’re not <term>themselves</term> feeling of humor.</p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Tracking.</headline> Since emotions are part of how we communicate, it’s as important to be aware of who is <em>feeling</em> what as it is who is <term>saying</term> what. Sometimes, we aren’t precise in tracking humor, and can even be careless about it—like saying “everyone laughed” in a group, even though some people weren’t feeling humor.</p>
    
    <p>We wouldn’t do this for speech. If most people said yes, and a few said no, it would be weird to say <term>everyone</term> said yes—or to mix-up who said yes with who said no. Even though we almost never do this with speech, we sometimes do this with emotions. This is often avoidable carelessness, since we're capable of applying the same care to emotions that we already do for speech.</p>
