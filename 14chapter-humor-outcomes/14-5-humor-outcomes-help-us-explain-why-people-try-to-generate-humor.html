Our evaluations change continuously

We can use humor outcomes to think not just about why people feel humor—but also about why people try to generate humor in the first place.

 

Santiago and Damien are walking through the halls.

Santiago: “Well. We lost every game but two this season. I feel like that’s some kind of achievement!”

Damien: *laughs* “Uh-huh, sure man.” 

To make narrative or motivational sense of why this humor is here, we can pick humor outcomes that seem to clearly describe this situation. 

In this case, we might say that Santiago and Damien gained a new perspective, changed negative emotions into positive ones, and symbolized close ties.

> Consider:

We could use other humor outcomes too. If Santiago and Damien had never brought up their losing streak before, we could describe this as dealing with (mildly) taboo topics and opening new topics of conversation. 

Since trying to gain a new perspective is a normal thing for people to do, this sets trying to generate humor into a normal and understandable system of motivations and goals.

 

 

File compression. Last chapter, we said that evaluatory information increased information density. Essentially, that means emotions let us say more with less. We can see this by imagining Santiago and Damien as surreally emotionless, which decreases the information density of their speech—requiring more words to say the same things:
Santiago: (rationally) "I am going to make an argument: I think it’s time we stop remembering our season as being a negative experience. Now that it’s in the past, we can clearly see it wasn’t as consequential as it felt at the time. Instead, we should treat it as an experience that, if accepted, can give us a new perspective on the relative importance of success—and on the relation of our feelings to objective conclusions.”
Damien: “Interesting. I am not yet convinced, but the premise merits further thought.”
Santiago: “Also, given that the median win/loss ratio was higher than ours, it’s not literally wrong to call our season exceptional—just maybe not exactly in a way that brings conventional prestige.”
Damien: *thinks it over* “Yes. I am in partial concurrence, although I think you purposely downplay counterpoints.”
Santiago: “I am glad you partially concur. Does this show close ties?”
Damien: “Yes.” 
The real Santiago and Damien communicated all this in just a few words! That's because humor and humor attempts are involved in adding evaluatory information—which increases the information density of the interaction, making it more efficient.

Trying to remove or preclude humor often makes communication ponderous and ineffective—which is part of why the things that generate humor effectively can feel dense, effective, incisive, light, multilayered, quick, and so on.
