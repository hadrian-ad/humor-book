Humor can be part of a complicated emotional state 
</h1>


<p>Since humor can be a part of a mixed emotional state, we often feel humor at the same time we feel something like shame:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Minh spends fifteen minutes explaining to Amaya how the mobile game Fired Fireman: First-Person Hooter had abandoned the things that made the franchise great. He talks and talks and talks and Amaya gets more and more bored.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <speech>“Minh—you’re being just like that fan boy character in Fired Fireman 2!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <internalaction>(aghast)</internalaction> <speech>“Squire Dorkulous Knows-a-Lot?”</speech> <internalaction>(ruefully)</internalaction> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Ouch!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh experiences both humor and shame)</notes></p>     
    </div>

<p>Minh experiences humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>being given new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>being acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>an argument being supported</humor-outcome>, and so on—generating humor. At the same time, the unflattering comparison <term>also</term> makes him feel mistake-predominant emotions:</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >
     



<p>In this case, we can still describe Minh’s <term>humor</term> in terms of good outcomes—but that doesn’t mean his humor can’t <em>coexist</em> with other things we’d describe as less straightforwardly positive, like shame.</p> 

<p>Other times, we might first feel humor, only for the humor to evaporate quickly, leaving us with just negative outcomes:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*leaving*</action> <speech>“See ya!”</speech> <internalaction>(mocking imitation)</internalaction> <speech>“I’m off to the big city to be an ahctress.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    
    <p><strong>A.</strong> <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feels Elias symbolized close ties and created rapport)</notes> <speech>“I do not sound like that!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><strong>B.</strong> <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*closes door*</action> <action>*feels sad*</action> <notes>(&larr;sadness&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feel Elias symbolized weak ties and created division)</notes></p>
    
    </div>
    
         <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-09-humor-can-be-part-of-a-complicated-emotional-state/14-09-1-jessica-shame.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Even though humor outcomes are describable as positive for those who <term>feel</term> humor, that’s different than saying the <em>overall</em> consequences of humor are always positive or remain positive—or that people can’t generate humor as part of a wider intention to cause harm.</p>

<p>
We can describe our model of humor in terms of actions or outcomes. These <vocab>humor outcomes</vocab> help us think narratively about humor in more ordinary language.</p>

<ul>
   <li>We'll use an arbitrarily limited list of humor outcomes in this book: acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</li> 
    
   <li>Humor outcomes help us describe why someone does or doesn't feel humor. A joke can't cause humor—humor outcomes cause humor.
   </li> 
    
    <li>Humor doesn't have negative outcomes to the person feeling it. If we feel shame, it's because we're feeling shame—not humor. We can feel shame <i>and</i> feel humor, or feel humor and <i>then</i> shame—but the negative outcomes are from mistake-predominant emotions, not humor.
