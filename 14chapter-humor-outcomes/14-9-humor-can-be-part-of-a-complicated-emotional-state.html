Humor can be part of a complicated emotional state 
</h1>


<p>Since humor can be a part of a mixed emotional state, we often feel humor at the same time we feel something like shame:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Minh spends fifteen minutes explaining to Amaya how the mobile game Fired Fireman: First-Person Hooter had abandoned the things that made the franchise great. He talks and talks and talks and Amaya gets more and more bored.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <speech>“Minh—you’re being just like that fan boy character in Fired Fireman 2!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <internalaction>(aghast)</internalaction> <speech>“Squire Dorkulous Knows-a-Lot?”</speech> <internalaction>(ruefully)</internalaction> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Ouch!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh experiences both humor and shame)</notes></p>     
    </div>

<p>Minh experiences humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>being given new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>being acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>an argument being supported</humor-outcome>, and so on—generating humor. At the same time, the unflattering comparison <sem>also</sem> makes him feel mistake-predominant emotions:</p>

<p>In this case, we can still describe Minh’s humor in terms of <term>good</term> outcomes—but that doesn’t mean his humor can’t <em>coexist</em> with other things we’d describe as less straightforwardly positive, like shame.</p> 

<p>Other times, we might first feel humor, only for the humor to evaporate quickly, leaving us with just negative outcomes:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*leaving*</action> <speech>“See ya!”</speech> <internalaction>(mocking imitation)</internalaction> <speech>“I’m off to the big city to be an ahctress.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    
    <p><strong>A.</strong> <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feels Elias symbolized close ties and created rapport)</notes> <speech>“I do not sound like that!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><strong>B.</strong> <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*closes door*</action> <action>*feels sad*</action> <notes>(&larr;sadness&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feel Elias symbolized weak ties and created division)</notes></p>

    style="max-width: 40rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Even though humor outcomes are describable as positive for those who <term>feel</term> humor, that’s different than saying the <em>overall</em> consequences of humor are always positive or remain positive—or that people can’t generate humor as part of a wider intention to cause harm.</p>


        <div class="chapter-end">
    <p>That's the end of this chapter! Next, we'll look at methods of using humor outcomes.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-example">


<p>At this point, we’ve gone over the four interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor. These are humor at different scales of looking—from the highest scale of our general word “humor,” to the smallest scale of “mistakes and OKs”:</p> 

<h2>Scales of Humor</h2>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Humor as an overall pattern (“humor”)</li>
    <li>Humor as experiences (humor family words)</li>
    <li>Humor as intentions or consequences (humor outcomes)</li>
    <li>Humor as expressive behavior (humor tells)</li>
    <li>Humor as information-assessments (mistakes and OKs)</li>
    </ul>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

 
<p>These different scales of humor are all happening at the same time. We choose between which scale to use based on what’s useful to us.</p>

<p>To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>:</p>

      <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-1-tells-into-outcomes.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 22rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word like <emotions>relief</emotions>:</p>

     <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-2-outcomes-into-family-word.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or just the word humor:</p>

    <p>These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to our intuitive understanding. And sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales for a greater range of perspective.</p>

    <div class="content">

<p>
Our model of emotions describes the evaluatory processes that generate humor. By describing these processes as actions or outcomes ("humor outcomes"), we can think narratively about humor using more ordinary language.</p>

<ul>
   <li>We'll use an arbitrarily limited list of <a href="14-0-humor-outcomes.html">humor outcomes</a> in this book: acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</li> 
    
   <li>The word "joke" relates a comment to other comments. A "humor outcome" relates a person to the world around them. By focusing on personal relativity, we can think about why someone does or doesn't feel humor in a way that sidesteps a discussion of genre. 


   </li> 
    
    <li>Humor is a <a href="14-8-humor-isn't-itself-a-negative-experience.html">positive emotion</a>. If we feel shame, it's because we're feeling shame—not because we're feeling humor. If we're feeling humor <i>and</i> shame, the positive component is from the humor, the negative component is from the shame.</li>
