Since humor can be a part of a mixed emotional state, we often feel humor at the same time we feel something like shame:



Minh spends fifteen minutes explaining to Amaya how the mobile game Fired Fireman: First-Person Hooter had abandoned the things that made the franchise great. He talks and talks and talks and Amaya gets more and more bored.

Amaya: “Minh—you’re being just like that fan boy character in Fired Fireman 2!”

Minh: (aghast) “Squire Dorkulous Knows-a-Lot?” (ruefully) *laughs* “Ouch!” (&larr;Minh experiences both humor and shame) 

Minh experiences humor outcomes, like being given new perspectives, being acceptably criticized, an argument being supported, and so on—generating humor. At the same time, the unflattering comparison also makes him feel shame: 



In this case, we can still describe Minh’s humor in terms of good outcomes—but that doesn’t mean humor can’t coexist with things we’d describe as less straightforwardly positive, like shame. 

Other times, we might first feel humor, only for the humor to evaporate quickly, leaving us with just negative outcomes:

 

Elias: *leaving* “See ya!” (mocking imitation) “I’m off to the big city to be an ahctress.” *laughs*

A. Jessica: *laughs* (&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feels Elias symbolized close ties and created rapport ) “I do not sound like that!”

B. Jessica: *closes door* *feels sad* (&larr;sadness&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feel Elias symbolized weak ties and created division)



Even though humor outcomes are generally describable as positive for those who feel humor, that’s different than saying the overall consequences of humor are always positive or remain positive—or that people can’t generate humor as part of a wider intention to cause harm.
