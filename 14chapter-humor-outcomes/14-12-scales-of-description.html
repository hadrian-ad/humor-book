Scales of humor</h1>


<p>At this point, we’ve gone over the five interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor. These are different scales of looking at humor—from the <term>highest</term> scale of our general word “humor,” to the <em>smallest</em> scale of “mistakes and OKs”:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Humor as an overall pattern <callback>(“humor”)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as experiences <callback>(humor family words)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as intentions or consequences <callback>(humor outcomes)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as expressive behavior <callback>(humor tells)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as information-assessments <callback>(mistakes and OKs)</callback></li>
    </ul>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

 
<p>These different scales of humor are all happening at the same time. We choose between which scale to use based on what’s useful to us.</p>

<p>To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>:</p>

      <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-1-tells-into-outcomes.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 22rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word like <emotions>relief</emotions>:</p>

     <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-2-outcomes-into-family-word.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or just the word humor:</p>

    <p>These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to our intuitive understanding. And sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales for a greater range of perspective.</p>

<p>One humor outcome is <humor-outcome>influence/control a situation</humor-outcome>. In this book, humor is the <sem>only</sem> way of achieving this outcome. More specifically, humor is the only way of achieving this outcome <vocab>concordantly</vocab>.</p>

 <div class="consider">
     <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
     <p class="considertext">"Concord" is a useful word that implies mutual agreement of purpose. It etymologically means "hearts together."</p>
 </div>

<p>
So there are other ways someone can influence/control a situation besides humor. They can threaten us with a lawsuit, draw a knife, call the police, or so on. But if we feel <term>fear</term>, there's no concordant influence. That's because <em>humor</em> is the only way to influence a situation concordantly.</p> 

<p>There are three kinds of influences corresponding to our three emotional zones. There's mistake-predominant influence <callback>(coercive influence)</callback>, humor influence <callback>(concordant influence)</callback>, and OK-predominant influence <callback>(inertial influence)</callback>. </p>

 <p>We experience coercive influence all the time <callback>(mistake-predomiant influence)</callback>&mdash;like when we obey mean-spirited police officers; no entry signs; foolish professors; confusing tax forms; grasping managers; domineering parents; and so on. These <sem>compel</sem> compliance through non-concordant means. </p>

<p>We also experience inertial influence all the time <callback>(OK-predominant influence)</callback>&mdash;like when we choose the familiar route over another; wear one style of clothing and not another; use one calendar system and not another; and so on. Inertial influence steers compliance through non-concordant means&mdash;something that's often invisible to us unless it's pointed out.</p> 

<p>Finally, we experience concordant influence <callback>(humor influence)</callback> all the time too. If someone smiles and asks us nicely if we'd move our bags, we may smile too and <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to move our bags. This creates compliance by merging individual goals together.</p>

<p>In this book, the emotion of humor is the mechanism of <sem>concordant</sem> influence. This lets us clarify our humor outcomes&mdash;they're outcomes achieved through <term>concord</term>, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <em>inertia</em> or <em>coercion</em>. Humor is the way we <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>reveal a personal review (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>acceptably critizize (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
  
  
  
  <p>This makes humor the line between influence by tradition and coercion&mdash;which makes humor the concordant method of change. It's the mechanism of concordant influence, of concordant perspective-giving, concordant rapport-creating, tie-making, and so on. There is no other concordant way to do this other than through humor.</p> 
 

  <div class="for-instance"> 
      <p class="for-instance">For instance: </p>
        
      <p class="for-instance-text">To open a topic of conversation, we would badger someone with a megaphone until they can't feel like they can avoid this topic of conversation. But then they'd be irritated and reluctant to talk about it <callback>(coercive, or unilateral, influence)</callback>.</p> 
        
       <p class="for-instance-text">On the other hand, if they show show humor tells (<humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, and so on) they may talk more openly about the topic, without feeling unilaterally compelled. In this case, we'll have a more mutual conversation <callback>(concordant, or multilateral, influence)</callback>. 
           </p>
           
 <p class="for-instance-text">Note that in the same way we can have mixed emotional states <callback>(like anger and humor)</callback>, there's nothing odd about various combinations of influences&mdash;like an experience that mingles concord with coercion.</p> 
               
  <p class="for-instance-text"> Similarly, in the same way there's nothing odd about going from humor to anger to humor again, there's nothing odd about our perspective of the kind of influence on us changing either.</p>

We can describe evaluatory processes that generate humor as actions or outcomes. This lets us think narratively about humor using more ordinary language.</p>

 
   <p>If we only have abstract or technical ways of talking about humor <callback>("mistakes and OKs")</callback>, it can be hard to talk our actual experiences. Humor outcomes give us ways of talking narratively about humor.</p>


<ul>
   <li>We'll use an arbitrarily limited list of <a href="14-0-humor-outcomes.html">humor outcomes</a> in this book: <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieve catharsis</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>change negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tensions</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>give new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>help one become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open up a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personality trait</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>survive in high stress situations</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>.</li> 
    
   <li>Humor outcomes describe actions that happen within an emotion situation. By <a href="14-3-humor-outcomes-help-us-think-about-why-someone-feels-humor.html">focusing on these actions</a>, we can track where and why humor happens in a way that sidesteps outcome-nonspecific terms of genre or tone.</li> 
    
    <li>Humor is a <a href="14-8-humor-isn't-itself-a-negative-experience.html">positive emotion</a>. If we feel shame, it's because we're feeling shame—not because we're feeling humor. If we're feeling humor <i>and</i> shame, the positive component is from the humor, the negative component is from the shame.</li>
