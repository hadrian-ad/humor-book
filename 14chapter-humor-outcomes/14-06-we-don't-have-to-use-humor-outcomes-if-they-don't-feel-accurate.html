Humor outcomes help us characterize humor
</h1>  

<p>Sometimes, it's easy to "match" humor to a humor outcomes:</p>
       
       <div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>The Big Book of Masturbation: From Angst to Zeal</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <humor-outcome>dealt with taboo topics</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>

     >


<p>But other times, humor outcomes <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> seem to match intuitively:</p>

  <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>

<p>To use humor outcomes in these situations, we have to be more thoughtful in specifying topics and relationships. So:   
        
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>
           instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>created rapport (<term>generally</term>)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>created rapport (<outcome-contrast><em>with her</em></outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
       </li>
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>controlled the situation (<term>generally</term>)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>controlled a situation (by <outcome-contrast><em>influencing how she spent her attention</em></outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
        </li>
        <li>
          instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>supported arguments (<term>generally</term>)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>supported an argument (<outcome-contrast><em>about what the book will be like</em></outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
            </li>
        <li>
            instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>gave her new perspectives (<term>generally</term>)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>gave her new perspective (<outcome-contrast><em>about how books can be titled</em></outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
        </li> 
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized (<term>everything</term>)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) acceptably criticized (<outcome-contrast><em>the title</em></outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome> or that <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>the title</outcome-contrast>) acceptably criticized (<outcome-contrast><em>other titles</em></outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>eased tensions (<term>generally</term>)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) eased tension (<outcome-contrast><em>with herself after encountering something weird</em></outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>handled complaints (<term>about itself</term>)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) handled (<outcome-contrast>her own</outcome-contrast>) complaint (<outcome-contrast><em>about the title</em></outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        </ul>    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
   
<p>
    These more flexibly adapted use of humor outcomes allow us to see them happening when Zoe smiles at a title like <book-title>Ferdedurke:</book-title>

           When someone feels humor, it's indicating an evaluatory action happening. To describe these actions with words, we can use humor outcomes&mdash;even when it seems related to something otherwise random, like a nonsense book title.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">We can assign humor outcomes by working backwards. We can pick a humor outcome and ask: in what way does this humor outcome apply? <callback>("In what way does Zoe <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome> when she smiles at <book-title>Handy Andy</book-title>?")</callback></p>

         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
          

<p class="considertext">Evaluations are ties from people to the world around them. Humor is a relational expression of these ties. Like wires that are wound together, these relations can be hard to pick apart and make sense of&mdash;but humor outcomes let us pull part the tangle to see how someone's evaluatory system is currently composed.</p>

   </div>

<!--
<div class="consider">  
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">We often feel that a lot happens in moments of humor&mdash;and that this complexity is hard for us to describe.</p>
      
    <p class="considertext">We can use humor outcomes to pull apart this complexity. By thinking about how they relate to moments of humor,
      
      Humor outcomes help us describe the texture and dimensionality to humor, and see more how people are relating to things around them.</p>
       </div>
-->

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Explaining.</headline> We often want to explain the humor we feel not by an outcome, but by a genre. So if we laugh looking at a book title, we might explain our laugh by calling the title a joke or satirical. <callback>("We laughed because the title was a joke.")</callback> But this isn’t usually the best way to go about explaining humor.</p>  
    
    <p>For one, a "joke" is just one of many possible ways of describing a title like <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title> or <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are</book-title>. For another, we don't always laugh at jokes&mdash;so calling something a joke doesn't yet <sem-weak>explain</sem-weak> why we did or didn't laugh when we saw it.</p>
        
    <p>But while Zoe doesn't always feel humor at every joke every time, Zoe <sem>always</sem> feels humor when she <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome>&mdash;otherwise, she wouldn’t have <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>. This Is why explaining Zoe's new perspectives explains her humor, while simply applying the word "joke" to things doesn't.</p>

 <p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain a family's humor. They didn't expect to see a sign like this <callback>(a mistake)</callback>, and it didn't have personal consequences for them <callback>(it's OK)</callback>.</p>
 
 <p>This would be a pretty shallow place to stop. So to dig deeper, we can use our list of humor outcomes. How would some humor outcomes apply, even in poetic or non-standard ways?</p>
 
 <p>By using humor outcomes, we can ask specific questions, like: in what way is their humor showing that something was <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>tensions were eased</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>new perspectives were found</humor-outcome>, that a <humor-outcome>personality trait was revealed</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>close ties were symbolized?</humor-outcome></p>
 
<p>By answering these questions, we can spark personal insight into some of the actions happening in the emotional situation.</p>

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain why Zoe and Emma felt humor. <callback>("The poster deviated from Zoe's expectations, and she felt equally secure from negative personal consequences.")</callback></p>

<p>At the same time, this generic language can obscure aspects of the emotional situation that we intuitively feel is happening. To cast a net for these aspects, we can use humor outcomes.</p>

<p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma's humor <humor-outcome>created rapport (among themselves, with the sign, with the establishment, and so on)</humor-outcome>; <humor-outcome>gave a new perspective (by inverting a meanginful idiom)</humor-outcome>; the sign's design, location, mood, sentiment, tone, vibe, and so on <humor-outcome>reveals a personal view (of the artist, establishment, or viewer)</humor-outcome>; and so on.</p>

    <p>We don't need to describe the genre or tone of Obama's statement <callback>("was it a joke? Satire? Mocking? Teasing? Biting? Clever?")</callback> to think about why the audience laughed.</p> 
    
    <p>Instead, we can simply say the audience laughed because they felt Obama <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave new perspective</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieved catharsis</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This lets us understand the relation between the statement and the audience in a way that explains humor&mdash;without getting bogged down in trying to categorize speech.</p> 
    
<p>Obama went on in a way that some people thought was mean-spirited:</p> 

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-IW6PwJYcOc?si=clNGfdAfVlSU1UuO&amp;start=335&amp;end=350" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Obama:</speaker> <internalaction>(derisively)</internalaction> <speech>"We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." <internalaction>(regaining composure)</internalaction>  "And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities."</speech></p></div>
    
<p>Let's say someone thought this was mean, not funny. What was different here than moments before?</p>

<p>Again, we can use humor outcomes. Someone who thought Obama went too far thought he didn't <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized</humor-outcome>, didn't <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>undermined</outcome-contrast> an argument</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
  
<p>As before, <sem>how</sem> we describe the comment doesn't matter <callback>(mocking, arguing, teasing, angry, joking, and so on)</callback> since those words are outcome nonspecific&mdash;they don't by themselves indicate who would or wouldn't laugh in a given situation. So we can instead start by simply saying that some viewers didn't feel they reached any humor outcomes&mdash;and so they didn't feel humor.</p>
