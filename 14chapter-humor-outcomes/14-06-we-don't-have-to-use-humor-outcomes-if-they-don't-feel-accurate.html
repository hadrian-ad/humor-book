Humor outcomes help us characterize humor
</h1>  

<p>To use humor outcomes effectively, we use the humor outcome as a linking phrase between someone and something.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Something doesn't <humor-outcome>create rapport (generally)</humor-outcome>&mdash;instead, <sem>someone</sem> feels <humor-outcome>rapport is created (<outcome-contrast>with something specific</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>.</p>
    
    </div>

<p>This is how we use humor outcomes when they don't feel intuitive.</p>
  
    
   <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
        <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-06-specific-topics/14-06-2-ferdydurke.sketchpad.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 33rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >

<p>Above, it doesn't feel correct to say a strange book title is <humor-outcome>supporting an argument (generally)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>dealing with taboo topic (generally)</humor-outcome>, or so on.</p>
 
<p>Instead, we have to relate the humor outcome to a person <callback>(Zoe)</callback>, and those humor outcomes to specific elements of the situation:</p>
 
         
           <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-06-specific-topics/14-06-3-ferdydurke-complete.sketchpad.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >
     
<p>This is true for any book title where the humor outcome alone doesn't intuitively "match" with a humor outcome:</p>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Cryptonomicon</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Handy Andy</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>
    </div>

  <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>
    </div>

<p>We can use humor outcomes in these cases by being more attentive to the specific situation. So:</p>
        
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>
           instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>created rapport (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>created rapport (<outcome-contrast>with her</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
       </li>
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>controlled the situation (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>controlled a situation (by <outcome-contrast>influencing how she spent her attention</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
        </li>
        <li>
          instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>supported arguments (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>supported an argument (<outcome-contrast>about what the book will be like</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
            </li>
        <li>
            instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>gave her new perspectives (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>gave her new perspective (<outcome-contrast>about how books can be titled</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
        </li> 
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized (everything)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) acceptably criticized (<outcome-contrast>the title</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome> or that <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>the title</outcome-contrast>) acceptably criticized (<outcome-contrast>other titles</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>eased tensions (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) eased tension (<outcome-contrast>with herself after encountering something weird</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>handled complaints (about itself)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) handled (<outcome-contrast>her own</outcome-contrast>) complaint (<outcome-contrast>about the title</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        </ul>    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
   
   <p> Above, we're treating a humor outcome like a verb. Someone has to do the verb, and sometimes the verb has to include an object. This lets us use "evalutary verbs" to talk about emotional actions.</p>
    

         
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
                                                      
        <p class="considertext">We're used to describing <term>physical</term> actions in a situation. <callback>(She moves across the room.)</callback> But we're less used to describing <em>evaluatory</em> actions in a situation. <callback>(She creates rapport with the people in the room.)</callback></p>
        
         <p class="considertext"> 
           Humor shows that an evaluatory action is happening. To broaden how we describe these actions, we can use humor outcomes&mdash;even when it seems related to something otherwise random, like a nonsense book title.</p> 
            

    </div>



<!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">We can assign humor outcomes by working backwards. We can pick a humor outcome and ask: in what way does this humor outcome apply? <callback>("In what way does Zoe <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome> when she smiles at <book-title>Handy Andy</book-title>?")</callback></p>
</div> 
-->

<!--
<div class="consider"> 

         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
          

<p class="considertext">Evaluations are ties from people to the world around them. Humor is a relational expression of these ties. Like wires that are wound together, these relations can be hard to pick apart and make sense of&mdash;but humor outcomes let us pull part the tangle to see how someone's evaluatory system is currently composed.</p>

   </div>
    -->
   
<!--
<div class="consider">  
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">We often feel that a lot happens in moments of humor&mdash;and that this complexity is hard for us to describe.</p>
      
    <p class="considertext">We can use humor outcomes to pull apart this complexity. By thinking about how they relate to moments of humor,
      
      Humor outcomes help us describe the texture and dimensionality to humor, and see more how people are relating to things around them.</p>
       </div>
-->


 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Explaining.</headline> We often use genres to explain the humor we feel, not humor outcomes. So if we laugh looking at a book title, we might explain our laugh by calling the title a joke or satirical. <callback>("We laughed because the title was a joke.")</callback> But this isn’t usually the best way to go about explaining humor.</p>  
    
    <p>For one, a "joke" is just one of many possible ways of describing a title like <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title> or <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are</book-title>. For another, we don't <sem>always</sem> laugh at jokes&mdash;so calling something a joke doesn't yet <sem-weak>explain</sem-weak> why we did or didn't laugh when we saw it.</p>
        
    <p>But while Zoe doesn't always feel humor at every joke every time, Zoe <sem>does</sem> always feels humor when she <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome>&mdash;otherwise, she wouldn’t have <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>. This is why explaining Zoe's new perspectives explains her humor in a way simply applying the word "joke" to things doesn't.</p> 
    
    <p>We can see the same thing with Justin and Heather.</p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Justin and Heather go biking through the cemetery every weekend. They often stop to ponder and enjoy a chipper sign that says</narration> <speech>“Cremation? Do we have a place FOR YOU!”</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(musing)</internalaction> <speech>“Is it a joke? Tongue-in-cheek? Reverse psychology? Tone deaf? Bad taste? Clever? Bold? Stupid? Engaging? Repulsive?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin gets lost in description)</notes></p>
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Why do I want that cremation spot so bad now?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Heather feels the sign <humor-outcome>created rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deals with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>opens a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, and so on)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Above, Justin wants to describe something with genre words&mdash;all of which sometimes generate humor, and sometimes don't. But it's not "tone deaf" that makes Heather laugh&mdash;the actual evaluatory action happening is <humor-outcome>rapport being created</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>taboo topics being dealt with</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new topics of conversation being opened</humor-outcome>, and so on. This directly explains the humor, instead of just describing an object.</p>

 <p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain a family's humor. They didn't expect to see a sign like this <callback>(a mistake)</callback>, and it didn't have personal consequences for them <callback>(it's OK)</callback>.</p>
 
 <p>This would be a pretty shallow place to stop. So to dig deeper, we can use our list of humor outcomes. How would some humor outcomes apply, even in poetic or non-standard ways?</p>
 
 <p>By using humor outcomes, we can ask specific questions, like: in what way is their humor showing that something was <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>tensions were eased</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>new perspectives were found</humor-outcome>, that a <humor-outcome>personality trait was revealed</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>close ties were symbolized?</humor-outcome></p>
 
<p>By answering these questions, we can spark personal insight into some of the actions happening in the emotional situation.</p>

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain why Zoe and Emma felt humor. <callback>("The poster deviated from Zoe's expectations, and she felt equally secure from negative personal consequences.")</callback></p>

<p>At the same time, this generic language can obscure aspects of the emotional situation that we intuitively feel is happening. To cast a net for these aspects, we can use humor outcomes.</p>

<p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma's humor <humor-outcome>created rapport (among themselves, with the sign, with the establishment, and so on)</humor-outcome>; <humor-outcome>gave a new perspective (by inverting a meanginful idiom)</humor-outcome>; the sign's design, location, mood, sentiment, tone, vibe, and so on <humor-outcome>reveals a personal view (of the artist, establishment, or viewer)</humor-outcome>; and so on.</p>

            </div>
     
    <p>We don't need to describe the genre or tone of Obama's statement <callback>("was it a joke? Satire? Mocking? Teasing? Biting? Clever?")</callback> to think about why the audience laughed.</p> 
    
    <p>Instead, we can simply say the audience laughed because they felt Obama <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave new perspective</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieved catharsis</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This lets us understand the relation between the statement and the audience in a way that explains humor&mdash;without getting bogged down in trying to categorize speech.</p> 
    
<p>Obama went on in a way that some people thought was mean-spirited:</p> 

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-IW6PwJYcOc?si=clNGfdAfVlSU1UuO&amp;start=335&amp;end=350" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Obama:</speaker> <internalaction>(derisively)</internalaction> <speech>"We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." <internalaction>(regaining composure)</internalaction>  "And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities."</speech></p></div>
    
<p>Let's say someone thought this was mean, not funny. What was different here than moments before?</p>

<p>Again, we can use humor outcomes. Someone who thought Obama went too far thought he didn't <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized</humor-outcome>, didn't <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>undermined</outcome-contrast> an argument</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
  
<p>As before, <sem>how</sem> we describe the comment doesn't matter <callback>(mocking, arguing, teasing, angry, joking, and so on)</callback> since those words are outcome nonspecific&mdash;they don't by themselves indicate who would or wouldn't laugh in a given situation. So we can instead start by simply saying that some viewers didn't feel they reached any humor outcomes&mdash;and so they didn't feel humor.</p>

         <div class="chapter-end">
    <p>That's the end of this chapter! Next, we'll look at humor tripwires.</p>

<div class="content-example">  
             
    
<p>At this point, we’ve gone over the five interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor. These are different scales of looking at humor—from the <term>highest</term> scale of our general word “humor,” to the <em>smallest</em> scale of “mistakes and OKs”:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Humor as an overall pattern <callback>(“humor”)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as experiences <callback>(humor family words)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as intentions or consequences <callback>(humor outcomes)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as expressive behavior <callback>(humor tells)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as information-assessments <callback>(mistakes and OKs)</callback></li>
    </ul>
    
         <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-0-pyramid.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

 
<p>These different scales of humor are all happening at the same time. We choose between which scale to use based on what’s useful to us.</p>

<p>To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>:</p>

      <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-1-tells-into-outcomes.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 22rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word like <emotions>relief</emotions>:</p>

     <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-10-scales-of-description/14-10-2-outcomes-into-family-word.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or just the word humor:</p>

    <p>These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to our intuitive understanding. And sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales for a greater range of perspective.</p>
