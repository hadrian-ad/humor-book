Humor outcomes help us characterize humor
</h1>  

<p>Sometimes, it's easy to "match" humor outcomes to humor.</p>  
  
 <div class="for-instance"> <p class="for-instance">For instance.</p>
      <p class="for-instance-text">When Zoe laughs at <book-title>The Big Book of Masturbation: From Angst to Zeal</book-title>, it's obvious to use a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>deals with taboo topics</humor-outcome>.</p>
       </div>

<p>But other times, humor outcomes <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> seem to match intuitively:</p>

  <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;we can use humor outcomes to describe this humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Cryptonomicon</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;we can use humor outcomes to describe this humor)</notes></p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Handy Andy</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;we can use humor outcomes to describe this humor)</notes></p>
    </div>

  
   <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it's not obvious how humor outcomes are relevant to this humor)</notes></p>
    </div>

<p>Humor outcomes can feel imprecise when they happen around something random, like a book titled <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title>. 
     
     <div class="for-instance">
         <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
         <p class="for-instance-text">If Zoe smiles, it's not obviously because the title <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title> is <humor-outcome>dealing with taboo topics</humor-outcome>.</p>
     </div>
      
<p>But we still can use humor outcomes&mdash;we just have to pair them with more specific topics and relationships::</p>
       
        
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>
           instead of saying the title <humor-outcome>created rapport (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt the title <humor-outcome>created rapport (<outcome-contrast>with her</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
       </li>
        <li>
        instead of saying the title <humor-outcome>controlled the situation (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt the title <humor-outcome>controlled a situation (by <outcome-contrast>influencing how she spent her attention</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
        </li>
        <li>
          instead of saying the title <humor-outcome>supported arguments (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt the title <humor-outcome>supported an argument (<outcome-contrast>about what the book will be like</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
            </li>
        <li>
            instead of saying the title <humor-outcome>gave her new perspectives (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt the title <humor-outcome>gave her new perspective (<outcome-contrast>about how books can be titled</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
        </li> 
        
        <li>
        instead of saying the title <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized (everything)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) acceptably criticized (<outcome-contrast>the title</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome> or that <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>the title</outcome-contrast>) acceptably criticized (<outcome-contrast>other titles</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        <li>
        instead of saying the title <humor-outcome>eased tensions (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) eased tension (<outcome-contrast>with herself after encountering something weird</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        <li>
        instead of saying the title <humor-outcome>handled complaints (about itself)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) handled (<outcome-contrast>her own</outcome-contrast>) complaint (<outcome-contrast>about the title</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        </ul>    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
   
         
<p>Humor shows an evaluatory action happened in the emotional situation. These evaulatory actions can be hard to put into words, especially when it seems to involve something random, like a random title&mdash;but humor outcomes help us pin down with words what is happening when someone feels humor.</p>



<!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">We can assign humor outcomes by working backwards. We can pick a humor outcome and ask: in what way does this humor outcome apply? <callback>("In what way does Zoe <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome> when she smiles at <book-title>Handy Andy</book-title>?")</callback></p>
</div> 
-->

<!--
<div class="consider"> 

         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
          

<p class="considertext">Evaluations are ties from people to the world around them. Humor is a relational expression of these ties. Like wires that are wound together, these relations can be hard to pick apart and make sense of&mdash;but humor outcomes let us pull part the tangle to see how someone's evaluatory system is currently composed.</p>

   </div>
    -->
   
<!--
<div class="consider">  
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">We often feel that a lot happens in moments of humor&mdash;and that this complexity is hard for us to describe.</p>
      
    <p class="considertext">We can use humor outcomes to pull apart this complexity. By thinking about how they relate to moments of humor,
      
      Humor outcomes help us describe the texture and dimensionality to humor, and see more how people are relating to things around them.</p>
       </div>
-->

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Explaining.</headline> We often want to explain the humor we feel not by an outcome, but by a genre. So if we laugh looking at a book title, we might explain our laugh by calling the title a joke or satirical. <callback>("We laughed because the title was a joke.")</callback> But this isn’t usually the best way to go about explaining humor.</p>  
    
    <p>For one, a "joke" is just one of many possible ways of describing a title like <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title> or <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are</book-title>. For another, we don't always laugh at jokes&mdash;so calling something a joke doesn't yet <sem-weak>explain</sem-weak> why we did or didn't laugh when we saw it.</p>
        
    <p>But while Zoe doesn't always feel humor at every joke every time, Zoe <sem>always</sem> feels humor when she <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome>&mdash;otherwise, she wouldn’t have <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>. This Is why explaining Zoe's new perspectives explains her humor, while simply applying the word "joke" to things doesn't.</p>

  <p>To practice using humor outcomes, we can look at some case studies.</p>

 <p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain a family's humor. They didn't expect to see a sign like this <callback>(a mistake)</callback>, and it didn't have personal consequences for them <callback>(it's OK)</callback>.</p>
 
 <p>This would be a pretty shallow place to stop. So to dig deeper, we can use our list of humor outcomes. How would some humor outcomes apply, even in poetic or non-standard ways?</p>
 
 <p>By using humor outcomes, we can ask specific questions, like: in what way is their humor showing that something was <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>tensions were eased</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>new perspectives were found</humor-outcome>, that a <humor-outcome>personality trait was revealed</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>close ties were symbolized?</humor-outcome></p>
 
<p>By answering these questions, we can spark personal insight into some of the actions happening in the emotional situation.</p>

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain why Zoe and Emma felt humor. <callback>("The poster deviated from Zoe's expectations, and she felt equally secure from negative personal consequences.")</callback></p>

<p>At the same time, this generic language can obscure aspects of the emotional situation that we intuitively feel is happening. To cast a net for these aspects, we can use humor outcomes.</p>

<p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma's humor <humor-outcome>created rapport (among themselves, with the sign, with the establishment, and so on)</humor-outcome>; <humor-outcome>gave a new perspective (by inverting a meanginful idiom)</humor-outcome>; the sign's design, location, mood, sentiment, tone, vibe, and so on <humor-outcome>reveals a personal view (of the artist, establishment, or viewer)</humor-outcome>; and so on.</p>

                <speaker>Obama:</speaker> <speech>"But I think Governor Romney maybe hasn't spent enough time looking at how our military works. You mentioned the Navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916."</speech> <internalaction>(irritated)</internalaction> <speech>"Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets&mdash;because the nature of our military's changed."</speech></p>

    <p>We don't need to describe the genre or tone of Obama's statement <callback>("was it a joke? Satire? Mocking? Teasing? Biting? Clever?")</callback> to think about why the audience laughed.</p> 
    
    <p>Instead, we can simply say the audience laughed because they felt Obama <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave new perspective</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieved catharsis</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This lets us understand the relation between the statement and the audience in a way that explains humor&mdash;without getting bogged down in trying to categorize speech.</p> 
    
<p>Obama went on in a way that some people thought was mean-spirited:</p> 

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-IW6PwJYcOc?si=clNGfdAfVlSU1UuO&amp;start=335&amp;end=350" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Obama:</speaker> <internalaction>(derisively)</internalaction> <speech>"We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." <internalaction>(regaining composure)</internalaction>  "And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities."</speech></p></div>
    
<p>Let's say someone thought this was mean, not funny. What was different here than moments before?</p>

<p>Again, we can use humor outcomes. Someone who thought Obama went too far thought he didn't <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized</humor-outcome>, didn't <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>undermined</outcome-contrast> an argument</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
  
<p>As before, <sem>how</sem> we describe the comment doesn't matter <callback>(mocking, arguing, teasing, angry, joking, and so on)</callback> since those words are outcome nonspecific&mdash;they don't by themselves indicate who would or wouldn't laugh in a given situation. So we can instead start by simply saying that some viewers didn't feel they reached any humor outcomes&mdash;and so they didn't feel humor.</p>
