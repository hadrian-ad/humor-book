<p>When Emma dodges down the hall, she reaches a few different humor outcomes—she <humor-outcome>avoided conflict (by postponing it)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints (by avoiding them)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>eased (her own) tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, and so on. But since her humor wasn’t particularly long-lasting or intense, Emma didn’t <term>intensely</term> feel she <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>.</p>

<p>By contrast, when Emma realizes there had never been any potential conflict—that she <humor-outcome><em>completely</em> avoided conflict</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><em>completely</em> eased (her own) tension</humor-outcome>—she feels a longer duration of high-intensity humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We can change the language of a humor outcome to reflect its intensity. At low-intensity humor, someone may just <term>somewhat</term> <humor-outcome>influence a situation</humor-outcome>. But at very intense humor, someone may <humor-outcome><em>completely</em> control a situation</humor-outcome>.</p>
     
    <p class="considertext">Similarly, at less intense humor, we we may just <humor-outcome><term>reduce</term> conflict</humor-outcome>—while at intense humor we may say we've <humor-outcome><em>completely</em> avoided conflict.</humor-outcome></p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Overlap.</headline> Our humor outcomes all overlap with each other—like how <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is similar to <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>. These humor outcomes all overlap because they’re all re-describing the same thing: <vocab>humor</vocab>!</p>

    <p>In a specific situation, some humor outcomes will feel like precise descriptions, while the rest will feel like imprecise descriptions. We usually stick with the precise descriptions for intuitive clarity.</p> 
    
    <p>At the same time, all humor outcomes describe all moments of humor in a loose, poetic sense—like how <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to something like <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>—or how <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>—or how <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>—and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>These phrases <em>interlock</em> and <em>overlap</em> because they’re different ways of describing the same thing: <vocab>humor</vocab>.</p>
