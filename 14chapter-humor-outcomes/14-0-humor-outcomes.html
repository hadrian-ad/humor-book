<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at “humor outcomes.” These are ways of re-describing “evaluating mistakes as OK” as actions or outcomes.</p>

<p>For instance, in some situations “evaluating mistakes as OK” is the same thing as gaining a new perspective. This means gain a new perspective is a humor outcome:</p>

 

<p>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title: “Wherever You Go, There You Are.”</p> 

<p>She thinks about that for a second, puzzled. Then something clicks, and she gives an amused nose-exhale. (&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;a mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe gained a new perspective)</p>

<p>Above, we're describing the same thing in three interchangeable ways:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Zoe feels humor</li>
    <li>Zoe evaluates a mistake as OK</li>
    <li>Zoe gains a new perspective. (&larr;humor described as its outcome)</li>
    </ol>
 

<li>There are many ways to describe humor in a particular situation as an outcome:</li>

List of humor outcomes

Support an argument

Change negative emotions into positive ones

Create rapport

Ease tension

Give new perspectives

Help one become accepted

Reduce defensiveness

Reveal a personality trait

Reveal a personal view

Survive in high stress situations

Handle complaints

Deal with taboo topics

Open up a new topic of conversation

Acceptably criticize

Symbolize close ties

Control a situation

Achieve catharsis

Avoid conflict

<p>These humor outcomes are actions. This is why each humor outcome starts with a verb: we help someone become accepted, ease tension, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, and so on.</p> 

<p>Since it’s easier to think about actions than invented terminology (“mistakes and OKs”), we can use humor outcomes to streamline our thinking. When we say Zoe gained a new perspective, we’re talking about humor in a way that’s intuitive and narratively understandable.</p> 

<p>We'll be talking about humor outcomes in the rest of this chapter.</p>



 
<div class="box">
    <p>Actions and states. “Humor outcomes” and “humor family words” are similar in that both are situation-specific replacements for the generic word “humor.”</p> 
     
    <p>But they are different in that humor family words are states (achievement, insight, reconciliation, safety, and so on) while humor outcomes are actions (control a situation, avoid conflict, and so on).</p> 
        
    <p>Together, humor outcomes and humor family words provide two different ways of thinking about the same thing: humor.</p>
