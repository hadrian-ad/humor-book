14. Humor Outcomes 
</h1>


<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at <vocab>humor outcomes</vocab>. These are ways of re-describing <i>"evaluating mistakes as OK"</i> as <em>actions</em> or <em>outcomes</em>.</p>

<p>For instance, in some situations, evaluating mistakes as OK is the same thing as gaining a new perspective. This means <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is a humor outcome:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title: “Wherever You Go, There You Are.”</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>She thinks about that for a second, puzzled. Then something clicks, and she gives an amused nose-exhale.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;a mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe gained a new perspective)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
<p>Above, we're describing the same thing in three interchangeable ways:</p>

<ol>
   <li>Zoe feels <emotions>humor</emotions></li>
    <li>Zoe <i>evaluates a mistake as OK</i></li>
    <li>Zoe <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome> <notes>(&larr;humor described as its outcome)</notes></li>
    </ol>

<p>There are many ways to describe humor in a particular situation as an outcome:</p>

<h2>List of humor outcomes</h2>
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Support an argument</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Change negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Create rapport</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Ease tension</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Give new perspectives</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Help one become accepted</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Reveal a personality trait</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Reveal a personal view</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Survive in high stress situations</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Handle complaints</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Open up a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Acceptably criticize</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Symbolize close ties</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Control a situation</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Achieve catharsis</humor-outcome></li>
    
    <li><humor-outcome>Avoid conflict</humor-outcome></li>
        
    </ul>
    
    <p>These humor outcomes are <term>actions</term>. This is why each humor outcome starts with a <em>verb</em>: we <humor-outcome><em>help</em> someone become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><em>ease</em> tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><em>support</em> an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><em>survive</em> in high stress situations</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 

<p>Since it’s easier to think about actions than it is to think about invented terminology <callback>(“mistakes and OKs”)</callback>, we can use humor outcomes to think quickly and effectively.

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
     
       <p class="for-instance-text">
           When we say Zoe <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, we’re talking about humor in a way that’s intuitive and narratively understandable. We know what this is like, and what sort of events do this, and why.</p>
           
           <p class="for-instance-text">We've already looked at how <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is humor. We did this when we looked at <a href="../7chapter-humor-family-words/7-1-realization-as-humor.html">humor family words</a>, like <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on.
           
           </p>
    
      
       
       </div>

<p>We'll be talking about humor outcomes in the rest of this chapter.</p>



 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Actions and states.</headline> <vocab>Humor outcomes</vocab> and <vocab>humor family words</vocab> are similar in that both are situation-specific replacements for the generic word “<vocab>humor</vocab>.”</p> 
     
    <p>But they are different in that humor family words are <term>states</term> (<emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on) while humor outcomes are <em>actions</em> (<humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, and so on).</p> 
        
    <p>Together, <vocab>humor outcomes</vocab> and <vocab>humor family words</vocab> provide two different ways of thinking about the same thing: <vocab>humor</vocab>.</p>
