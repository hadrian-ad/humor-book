Humor outcomes add context to the word humor 
</h1>
     
    
<p>We can use humor outcomes to describe <term>individual</term> moments of humor. But we can also use humor outcomes to describe the humor <em>overall</em> in a situation:
 </p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina find Damien sitting by himself.</narration> <speech>“Want to come sit with us?”</speech> <narration>Xiaowei asks. Damien gathers his lunch bag and sits with them.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina are making each other laugh, and take time to explain some inside jokes to Damien. After a while, Damien starts smiling and joins in a bit.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Lina and Xiaowei help Damien become accepted&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
    
    </div>
    
    
     <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-01-humor-outcome-inject-context/14-01-3-become-accepted.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem ; margin-left: 2rem" 
     >
     


<p>We can use humor outcomes to describe Damien’s humor over a longer timescale: throughout the lunch period, Lina and Xiaowei were trying to <humor-outcome>help Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>.</p> 

<p>Since Damien was feeling humor, they were successful&mdash;Damien felt <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>,  <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>


 
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Humor outcomes make it easier to talk about collective humor that happens over longer periods of time. We don't need a transcript to talk about the whys and hows of Damien's humor. Instead, we can just say Lina and Xiaowei <humor-outcome>helping Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think we need to dig through conversations sentence-by-sentence to discover what generates humor. Sometimes this can make us miss the forest for the trees&mdash;and simply thinking about humor outcomes on a longer timescale can help understand broader changes happening in the emotional situation.</p>
