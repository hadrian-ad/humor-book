Humor outcomes over time
</h1>
     
<p>We used humor outcomes to describe <term>individual</term> moments of humor. But we can also use humor outcomes to describe the humor in a situation <em>overall</em>:

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina find Damien sitting by himself.</narration> <speech>“Want to come sit with us?”</speech> <narration>Xiaowei asks. Damien gathers his lunch bag and sits with them.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina are making each other laugh, and take time to explain some inside jokes to Damien. After a while, Damien starts smiling and joins in a bit.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Lina and Xiaowei help Damien <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome>&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

<p>Damien felt humor over a period of twenty minutes. We can describe this longer timescale of humor with humor outcomes: throughout the lunch period, Lina and Xiaowei were trying to <humor-outcome>help Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>.</p> 

<p>Because Damien felt humor, Line and Xiaowei were successful in getting Damien to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>,  <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mdash;he <humor-outcome>became accepted</humor-outcome>.</p>


 
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We don't always need to dig through conversations sentence-by-sentence to discover what generates humor&mdash;since this moment-by-moment approach can make us miss the forest for the trees.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We don't need a transcript before we can talk about Damien's humor. Instead, we can use humor outcomes to talk about the collective humor that happens over periods of time: taken together, Lina and Xiaowei <humor-outcome>helped Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>.</p>
