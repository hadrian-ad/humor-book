Humor outcomes over time
</h1>
     
<p>We can use humor outcomes to describe <term>individual</term> moments of humor. But we can also use humor outcomes to describe <em>overall</em> experiences of humor:
 </p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina find Damien sitting by himself.</narration> <speech>“Want to come sit with us?”</speech> <narration>Xiaowei asks. Damien gathers his lunch bag and sits with them.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina are making each other laugh, and take time to explain some inside jokes to Damien. After a while, Damien starts smiling and joins in a bit.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Lina and Xiaowei <humor-outcome>help Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem ; margin-left: 2rem" 
     >
     


<p>Without knowing anything specifically that was said, we can still describe the overall experience with humor outcomes: throughout the lunch period, Lina and Xiaowei were trying to <humor-outcome>help Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>.</p> 

<p>And since Damien felt humor, Lina and Xiaowei were successful in getting Damien to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>,  <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mdash;Damien <humor-outcome>became accepted</humor-outcome>.</p>


 
<div class="box">

    
    <p><headline>Scale.</headline> Sometimes we think of humor as something that primarily has to do with sentences&mdash;and so to discover why someone felt humor, we'd have to have a transcript. But this granular approach can be like thinking we have to look at each tree before saying it's a forest.</p>
    
    <p>We can use humor outcomes to talk about the collective humor that happened over a general period of time: taken together, over a period of twenty minutes, Lina and Xiaowei <humor-outcome>helped Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>. We can say this without knowing any specifics about what they talked about.</p>
