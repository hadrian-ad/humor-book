Humor outcomes help us think about why someone feels humor 
</h1>


<div class="listbox">
   <p class="listbox-headline"> Humor outcomes</p>
   
    <p><i>acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</i></p>
    </div>
    
<p>We can use humor outcomes to think about why people feel humor:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore, and finds a book called Wherever You Go, There You Are. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe gained a new perspective and other humor outcomes)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called The Big Book of Masturbation: From Angst to Zeal. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe dealt with taboo topics and other humor outcomes)</notes></p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Why Be Happy When You Could be Normal? She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe eased tension and other humor outcomes)</notes></p>
    </div> 
    
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe felt an argument was supported and other humor outcomes)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 
    
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called A Queer and Pleasant Danger. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe felt rapport was created and other humor outcomes)</notes></p> 
        </div>
        
<p>Why did Zoe feel humor? In each case, we can use a humor outcome: she felt humor because she <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, she felt <humor-outcome>taboo topics were being dealt with</humor-outcome>, and so on. This orients us to how we’d talk about her evaluations of mistakes and OKs.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">
   When explaining Zoe’s humor, we <term>first</term> start with a humor outcome. <callback>(“Zoe gained a new perspective.”)</callback> We <em>then</em> think about why something did that for Zoe specifically. <callback>(“What about this title was a new perspective for her?”)</callback> 
   </p>
 <p class="considertext">
   A title by itself can't have a new perspective—it’s only a new perspective to <term>someone</term>. This is why we have to tether our thinking about humor outcomes to Zoe, not just to the title by itself.
           </p>     
    </div>
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Explaining.</headline> When we feel humor, we sometimes want to explain it by using genre words—like by saying a book title was a joke or satire. <callback>("We laughed because the title was a joke.")</callback> But this isn’t usually the best way to go about explaining humor.</p> 
       
    <p>For one, a joke is often an awkward or incomplete description of something—like how a "joke" isn't the only way to describe a title like <i>Wherever You Go, There You Are</i>. </p>
    
    <p>More importantly, we don't always laugh at jokes. So just calling something a joke doesn't <term>explain</term> why someone would or wouldn't feel humor from it.</p> 
    
    <p>When Zoe comes across a joke, she could feel <emotions>annoyance</emotions> as easily as <emotions>humor</emotions>—because saying something is a “joke” doesn’t specify what the actual emotional outcome will be.</p> 
    
    <p>By contrast, when Zoe <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome>, she <em>always</em> feels humor—otherwise, she wouldn’t have <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <p>To explain someone’s humor, we <term>first</term> start with a plausible humor outcome <callback>(“Zoe gains a new perspective”)</callback>, and <em>then</em> think about how that’s related to the content and context. <callback>(“Why is this a new perspective for her?”)</callback> This leads to stronger explanations of humor, without becoming sidetracked by descriptive, outcome-unspecific words like joke or satire.</p>
