Humor outcomes
acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.
We can use humor outcomes to think about why people feel humor:

 

Zoe is browsing the bookstore, and finds a book called Wherever You Go, There You Are. She smiles. (&larr;Zoe gained a new perspective and other humor outcomes)

 

Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called The Big Book of Masturbation: From Angst to Zeal. She smiles. (&larr;Zoe dealt with taboo topics and other humor outcomes)

 

Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called Why Be Happy When You Could be Normal? She smiles. (&larr;Zoe eased tension and other humor outcomes)

 

Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948. She smiles. (&larr;Zoe felt an argument was supported and other humor outcomes)

 

Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called A Queer and Pleasant Danger. She smiles. (&larr;Zoe felt rapport was created and other humor outcomes) 

Why did Zoe feel humor? In each case, we can use a humor outcome: she gained a new perspective, she felt taboo topics were being dealt with, and so on. This orients us to how we’d talk about her evaluations of mistakes and OKs.

> Consider:

When explaining Zoe’s humor, we start with a humor outcome. (“Zoe gained a new perspective.”) Then we think about why something did that for Zoe specifically. (“What about this title was a new perspective for her?”) 

 

A title by itself can't have a new perspective—it’s only a new perspective to someone. This is why we have to tether our thinking about humor outcomes to Zoe, not just to the title by itself.

 

 

Explaining. When we feel humor, we sometimes want to explain it by using genre words—like by saying a book title was a joke or satire. ("We laughed because the title was a joke.") But this isn’t usually the best way to go about explaining humor. 
For one, a joke is often an awkward or incomplete description of something—like how a "joke" isn't the only or even best way to describe a title like Wherever You Go, There You Are. More importantly, calling something a joke doesn't explain why someone would or wouldn't feel humor from it—since we don't always laugh at jokes. 

Zoe could feel annoyance as easily as humor when she comes across a joke—because saying something is a “joke” doesn’t specify what the actual emotional outcome will be. But when Zoe gains a new perspective, she always feels humor—otherwise, she wouldn’t have gained a new perspective. 

To explain someone’s humor, we can first start with a plausible humor outcome (“Zoe gains a new perspective”), and then think about how that’s related to the content and context. (“Why is this a new perspective for her?”) This leads to stronger explanations of humor, without becoming sidetracked by descriptive, outcome-unspecific words like joke or satire.
