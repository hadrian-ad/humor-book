Humor outcomes can describe the absence of humor

<p>Humor outcomes can be used to describe both the <term>presence</term> and <em>absence</em> of humor in different situations:</p>

<p>Above, Minh and Owen feel humor at the <term>same</term> thing for <em>different</em> reasons. Minh feels the poster <humor-outcome>eases the tension (<outcome-contrast>he has about decision-making</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, while Owen feels the poster <humor-outcome>creates rapport (<outcome-contrast>by being empathetic</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>.</p> 

<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">At base, humor outcomes are still just narrative descriptions of mistakes and OKs being balanced. So Owen won't feel any empathetic poster <humor-outcome>creates rapport</humor-outcome>, just because it's empathetic&mdash;he only <humor-outcome>feels rapport</humor-outcome> if his mistakes and OKs balance.</p>
         
         <p class="considertext">For instance, if university hallways are usually sterile and cold, empathetic posters from fellow students will both deviate from his expectations <callback>(mistake)</callback> at the same time he feels secure from negative personal consequences <callback>(OK)</callback>.</p>
         
             
           <p class="considertext">By contrast, if Owen walks through a kindergarten every day, he'll <sem>expect</sem> empathetic posters, so new ones will just be a small mistake&mdash;and he'll feel posters for young children have a large OK. In this case, Owen <outcome-contrast>won't</outcome-contrast> feel an empathetic poster in a kindergarten <humor-outcome>creates rapport</humor-outcome>, simply because it's empathetic.   </p>

<p><headline>Ties.</headline> We evaluate the world around us, tying us to the world. Like wires wound together, these relations can be hard to pick apart&mdash;especially as our evaluations are constantly changing. Humor marks a current arrangment of these ties.</p>

<p>Humor outcomes help us adapt and multi-present the big picture of "humor" in the smaller picture of specific situations&mdash;and in ways that helps us make narrative sense of humor as an active, fluidly changing, and always-relevant part of our evaluatory ties to everything else.</p>

<div class="content-example">  
    
    <p>At this point, we’ve gone over the five interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor. These are different scales of looking at humor—from the <term>highest</term> scale of our general word “humor,” to the <em>smallest</em> scale of “mistakes and OKs”:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Humor as an overall pattern <callback>(“humor”)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as experiences <callback>(humor family words)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as intentions or consequences <callback>(humor outcomes)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as expressive behavior <callback>(humor tells)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as information-assessments <callback>(mistakes and OKs)</callback></li>
    </ul>
    
         <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-0-pyramid.png

    alt="This pyramid is divided into five sections. At top is humor (overall pattern), then humor family words (situation  or states), humor outcomes (actions), humor tells (behavior) and finally mistakes and OKs (assessments)";
    title="Assembly of humor";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

 
<p>These different scales of humor are all happening at the same time. We choose between which scale to use based on what’s useful to us.</p>

<p>To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>:</p>

      <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-1-tells-into-outcomes.png

    alt="This molecule figure has three humor tell dots: loosening, social integration, and relaxed posture. They are arranged into a triangle with the dots as points, forming a humor outcome 'ease tension'";
    title="Molecule figure";
    style="max-width: 22rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word like <emotions>relief</emotions>:</p>

     <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-2-outcomes-into-family-word.png

    alt="This molecule figure has three humor outcomes, represented by the triangle figure of compounded humor tells, forming an even larger triangle of a humor family word. In this way, negative emotions changed into positive ones, easing tensions, surviving a high stress environment, all compound into a 'relief' molecule.";
    title="Molecule figure II";
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or just the word humor:</p>

    <p>These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to our intuitive understanding. And sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales for a greater range of perspective.</p>
