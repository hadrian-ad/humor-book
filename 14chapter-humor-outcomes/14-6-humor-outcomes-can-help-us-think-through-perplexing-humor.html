Humor outcomes can help us think through perplexing humor 
</h1>




<p>We can use humor outcomes to explain more perplexing attempts to generate humor:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*hands on hips*</action> <speech>“Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <action>*playing a game*</action> <internalaction>(listlessly)</internalaction> “When my shit turns blue.”</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*throws hands up*</action> <notes>(&larr;Heather feels Xiaowei is being flippant)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;mistakes and OKs match&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
<p>Why did Xiaowei laugh? In the absence of an explanation, we might rely on explanation-substitute words—like that his humor was:</p> 


<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li>destructive</li>
    
    <li>discourteous</li>
    
    <li>disrespectful</li>
    
    <li>counter-productive</li>
    
    <li>facetious</li>
    
    <li>flippant</li>
    
    <li>immature</li>
    
    <li>impolite</li>
    
    <li>inappropriate</li>
    
    <li>inopportune</li>
    
    <li>irreverent</li>
    
    <li>needling</li>
    
    <li>out-of-line</li>
    
    <li>senseless</li>
    
    <li>rude</li>
    
    <li>tastless</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Setting aside whether those words have <em>descriptive</em> merit, they don't really have <term>explanatory</term> merit&mdash;they characterize <em>tone</em>, not <term>motivation</term> or <term>purpose</term>.</p> 

<p>To work through this situation, we follow an order of operations.</p> 

<p>First, we sort out who felt humor, and when.


<p>We’ll see that <term>Heather</term> didn’t feel humor at all. But <em>Xiaowei</em> did—<term>after</term> Heather threw up her hands.</p> 

<p><em>Then</em>, at this point—where there’s humor—we can see if any humor outcomes seem to clearly describe the situation.</p> 

<p>We might say Xiaowei:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li><humor-outcome>avoided conflict (about how he was spending time)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>handled a complaint (by shutting down a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>revealed a personal view (that he doesn’t want to get a job)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>supported an argument (that this isn’t a good time for a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>eased tensions (with himself)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>controlled a situation (by ending a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Xiaowei laughed because he reached or stumbled into humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>avoiding conflict</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>controlling a situation</humor-outcome>. This puts his behavior into an understandable framing.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Describing Xiaowei’s humor with humor outcomes doesn’t mean he was effective; did something well; that others shouldn’t describe him as rude; or so on.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Instead, we’re trying to avoid what can sometimes be our first impression: that he was being erratic; that his behavior was inscrutable; that humor is fundamentally inexplicable; or so on.</p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>Heather didn’t feel humor, because she felt Xiaowei <humor-outcome><term>created</term> conflict</humor-outcome>, not <humor-outcome><em>avoided</em> conflict</humor-outcome>. Heather and Xiaowei were desynchronized, and she decided to leave instead of trying to resynchronize.</p>

 

<div class="box"> 
     
     <p><headline>Topics and humor outcomes.</headline> We can use topics to describe a situation in an orderly way. That's because humor outcomes aren't experienced abstractly—a specific topic experiences a humor outcome.</p>
         
    <p>So when we say <humor-outcome>achieve catharsis</humor-outcome> is a humor outcome, that doesn't mean we <humor-outcome>achieve catharsis</humor-outcome> on <term>everything</term>, all at once. Instead, just a <em>single</em> or specific cluster of topics <humor-outcome>achieve catharsis</humor-outcome>.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if we laugh because of someone landed an great point, we laugh because they <humor-outcome>supported their argument</humor-outcome>&mdash;not because we feel that <term>all</term> arguments everywhere of every kind have been supported. Instead, we feel a <em>specific</em> component of a specific argument has been supported, relative to us.</p>
          
     <p>Since different topics can generate humor, the humor outcome we use depends on the topic. We can see this with our example with Heather and Xiaowei.</p>  
     
     <p>Some of Xiaowei's active topics might be: </p>
     
     <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
        <li>‘Heather’s reaction’</li>
         
         <li>‘this conversation’</li>
         
         <li>‘Xiaowei’s life’</li>
         
         </ul>
     
     <p>If Xiaowei had <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome>handled a complaint</humor-outcome>, we can loosely correspond each one to their most contextually relevant topic:</p>
     
      
     <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
         <li>‘Heather’s reaction’&rarr;<notes>Xiaowei avoided conflict (with his mother)</notes></li>
         
         <li>‘this conversation’<notes>&rarr;Xiaowei controlled the situation (the conversation)</notes></li>
         
         <li>‘Xiaowei’s overall life’&rarr;<notes>Xiaowei handled a complaint (about his life)</notes></li>
         
         </ul> 
     
     <p>While this is more detail than we'll usually use in this book, this attribution of humor outcomes to specific topics helps us think about how we're describing a situation, and why.

    <p>What does it mean to say Dave and Karen <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective here</humor-outcome>? Since specific topics generate humor, it's specific topics that reach humor outcomes. That means a <sem>specific topic</sem> <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>.</p>
    
    
     <p>So when Dave and Karen <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> at the poster about intellectual property, they didn't gain a new perspective about <sem>everything</sem>. It might not even be about the broad topic 'intellectual property.' Instead, we can be more specific.</p>
     
     <p>
      It might be that Dave and Karen may have <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome> on more granular topics like 'Buddhism,' 'English language,' 'translations,' 'standards of discussion,' 'Thailand,' 'this trip,' or so on. This helps us be more grounded in how we understand and use humor outcomes.
