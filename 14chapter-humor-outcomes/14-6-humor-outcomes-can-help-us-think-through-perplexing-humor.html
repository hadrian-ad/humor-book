Humor outcomes can help us think through perplexing humor 
</h1>




<p>The example with Damien and Santiago is a benign and familiar kind of attempt at generating humor. But we can use humor outcomes to explain more perplexing attempts to generate humor:</p>

 

<p>Heather: *hands on hips* “Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”</p>

<p>Xiaowei: *playing a game* (listlessly) “When my shit turns blue.”</p>

<p>Heather: *throws hands up* (&larr;Heather feels Xiaowei is being flippant)</p>

<p>Xiaowei: *laughs* (&larr;mistakes and OKs match&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p> 


<p>Why did Xiaowei laugh? In the absence of an explanation, we might rely on explanation-substitute words—like that his humor was:</p> 


<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li>destructive</li>
    
    <li>discourteous</li>
    
    <li>disrespectful</li>
    
    <li>counter-productive</li>
    
    <li>facetious</li>
    
    <li>flippant</li>
    
    <li>immature</li>
    
    <li>impolite</li>
    
    <li>inappropriate</li>
    
    <li>inopportune</li>
    
    <li>irreverent</li>
    
    <li>needling</li>
    
    <li>out-of-line</li>
    
    <li>senseless</li>
    
    <li>rude</li>
    
    <li>tastless</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Setting aside whether those words have descriptive merit, the problem with them is that they don’t explain why Xiaowei did what he did—those words are characterizations of tone, not of purpose or motivation.</p> 

<p>To work through this situation, we first sort out who felt humor, and when. We’ll see that Heather didn’t feel humor at all, but Xiaowei did—after Heather threw up her hands. At this point—where there’s humor—we can see if any humor outcomes seem to clearly describe the situation.</p> 

<p>We might say Xiaowei:</p> 

<ul>
   <li>avoided conflict (about how he was spending time)</li>
    <li>handled a complaint (by shutting down a conversation)</li>
    <li>revealed a personal view (that he doesn’t want to get a job)</li>
    <li>supported an argument (that this isn’t a good time for a conversation)</li>
    <li>eased tensions (with himself)</li>
    <li>controlled a situation (by ending a conversation)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Xiaowei laughed because he reached or stumbled into humor outcomes, like avoiding conflict or controlling a situation. This puts his behavior into an understandable framing.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">Describing Xiaowei’s humor with humor outcomes doesn’t mean he was effective; did something well; that others shouldn’t describe him as rude; or so on. Instead, we’re trying to avoid what can sometimes be our first impression: that he was being erratic; that his behavior was inscrutable; that humor is fundamentally inexplicable; or so on.</p> 

<p>Heather didn’t feel humor, because she felt Xiaowei created conflict, not avoided conflict. Heather and Xiaowei were desynchronized, and she decided to leave instead of trying to resynchronize.</p>

 

 

<p>Topics and humor outcomes. We can use topics to describe a situation in an orderly way. That's because humor outcomes aren't experienced abstractly—a specific topic experiences a humor outcome.</p>



<p>Different topics can generate humor. The way we describe that humor depends on the topic. We can see this with our example with Heather and Xiaowei.</p> 

 

<p>Some of the active topics that generate humor in Xiaowei are: </p>


<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
   <li>‘Heather’s reaction’</li>
    
    <li>‘this conversation’</li>
    
    <li>‘Xiaowei’s life’</li>
    
    </ul>

 

<p>If Xiaowei had avoided conflict, controlled a situation, and handled a complaint, we can loosely correspond them to their most contextually relevant topic:</p>

 
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li>‘Heather’s reaction’ -> Xiaowei avoided conflict (with his mother)</li>
    
    <li>‘this conversation’ -> Xiaowei controlled the conversation</li>
    
    <li>‘Xiaowei’s overall life’ -> Xiaowei handled a complaint (about his life)</li>
    
    </ul> 

<p>This helps us be specific in how we’re describing a situation, and why.</p>
