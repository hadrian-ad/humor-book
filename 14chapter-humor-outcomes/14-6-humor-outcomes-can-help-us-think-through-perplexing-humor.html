Humor outcomes can help us think through perplexing humor 
</h1>




<p>We can use humor outcomes to explain more perplexing attempts to generate humor:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*hands on hips*</action> <speech>“Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <action>*playing a game*</action> <internalaction>(listlessly)</internalaction> “When my shit turns blue.”</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*throws hands up*</action> <notes>(&larr;Heather feels Xiaowei is being flippant)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;mistakes and OKs match&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
<p>Why did Xiaowei laugh? In the absence of an explanation, we might rely on explanation-substitute words—like that his humor was:</p> 


<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li>destructive</li>
    
    <li>discourteous</li>
    
    <li>disrespectful</li>
    
    <li>counter-productive</li>
    
    <li>facetious</li>
    
    <li>flippant</li>
    
    <li>immature</li>
    
    <li>impolite</li>
    
    <li>inappropriate</li>
    
    <li>inopportune</li>
    
    <li>irreverent</li>
    
    <li>needling</li>
    
    <li>out-of-line</li>
    
    <li>senseless</li>
    
    <li>rude</li>
    
    <li>tastless</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Setting aside whether those words have <term>descriptive</term> merit, they don't really have <em>explanatory</em> merit. They characterize <em>tone</em>, not <term>motivation</term> or <term>purpose</term>.</p> 

<p>To work through this situation, we follow an order of operations.</p> 

<p><term>First</term>, we sort out <term>who</term> felt humor, and <term>when</term>.


<p>We’ll see that <term>Heather</term> didn’t feel humor at all. But <em>Xiaowei</em> did—<term>after</term> Heather threw up her hands.</p> 

<p><em>Then</em>, at this point—<em>where there’s humor</em>—we can see if any humor outcomes seem to clearly describe the situation.</p> 

<p>We might say Xiaowei:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li><humor-outcome>avoided conflict (about how he was spending time)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>handled a complaint (by shutting down a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>revealed a personal view (that he doesn’t want to get a job)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>supported an argument (that this isn’t a good time for a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>eased tensions (with himself)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>controlled a situation (by ending a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Xiaowei laughed because he reached or stumbled into humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>avoiding conflict</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>controlling a situation</humor-outcome>. This puts his behavior into an understandable framing.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Describing Xiaowei’s humor with humor outcomes doesn’t mean he was effective; did something well; that others shouldn’t describe him as rude; or so on. Instead, we’re trying to avoid what can sometimes be our first impression: that he was being erratic; that his behavior was inscrutable; that humor is fundamentally inexplicable; or so on.</p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>Heather didn’t feel humor, because she felt Xiaowei <humor-outcome><em>created</em> conflict</humor-outcome>, not <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>. Heather and Xiaowei were desynchronized, and she decided to leave instead of trying to resynchronize.</p>

 

<div class="box"> 
     
     <p><headline>Topics and humor outcomes.</headline> We can use topics to describe a situation in an orderly way. That's because humor outcomes aren't experienced abstractly—a specific topic experiences a humor outcome.</p>
          
     <p>Different topics can generate humor. The means that which humor outcome we use depends on the topic. We can see this with our example with Heather and Xiaowei.</p>  
     
     <p>Some of the active topics that generate humor in Xiaowei are: </p>
     
     <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
        <li>‘Heather’s reaction’</li>
         
         <li>‘this conversation’</li>
         
         <li>‘Xiaowei’s life’</li>
         
         </ul>
     
     <p>If Xiaowei had <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome>handled a complaint</humor-outcome>, we can loosely correspond each one to their most contextually relevant topic:</p>
     
      
     <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
         <li>‘Heather’s reaction’&rarr;<notes>Xiaowei avoided conflict (with his mother)</notes></li>
         
         <li>‘this conversation’<notes>&rarr;Xiaowei controlled the conversation</notes></li>
         
         <li>‘Xiaowei’s overall life’&rarr;<notes>Xiaowei handled a complaint (about his life)</notes></li>
         
         </ul> 
     
     <p>While this is more detail than we'll use in this book, this attribution of humor outcomes to specific topics helps us think about how we're describing a situation, and why.</p>
