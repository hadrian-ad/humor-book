       <p class="overtitle">Sword of Joy</p>
<p class="subtitle">A Wielder's Guide to Humor</p>       
</div>



<p>This is a book about pulling a sword from a stone&mdash;a sword called <vocab>joy</vocab>. And more than that, it's about actually <sem-weak>wielding</sem-weak> that sword, once pulled out. </p>
  
    <p>We'll call wielding the sword of joy <vocab>humor</vocab>. By learning to wield humor, we gain a degree of mastery of the power of transitions and changes.</p>

        <p>Most of us are untrained swordsman when it comes to humor&mdash;we've been swinging that sword around all our life, which can sometimes make us overconfident. We think there's nothing more to learn about swordplay. That's completely wrong!</p>
        
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>    
        <p class="considertext">It would be a bit like thinking a geometry class has nothing to contribute, since we've been around squares and triangles all our lives. But, in fact, geometry class has a lot to contribute to our understanding of things!</p> </div>
        
    <p>Humor is one of the secret sciences&mdash;it's simply not taught. Most of us have had instruction in all kinds of things, including working out, baking, calculus, Shakespeare, and so on&mdash;while we've probably never had formal instruction on <em>humor</em>. Which is a bit odd, when we think about it!</p>
                
     
  
      <p>Skipping humor as field of study has compounding disadvantages&mdash;often in ways we don't even realize until we undergo the study.</p>
        
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">
        Most of us have internalized myths about humor&mdash;like that humor can't be taught. This is usually is just a self-reference: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback></p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">Other times, it's an unsound inference. <callback>"Humor was never taught to me (so therefore it must not be able to be taught)"</callback>
    </p>
 

</div>
     
  
<p>Our understanding of joy and humor are often <sem>insufficient</sem> for functional tasks.</p>


<!--
  <p>Finally, we sometimes make assumptions we're not in a position to evaluate. As high schoolers, we probably thought squares and triangles were the simplist kind of shapes. That didn't mean we were in a position to judge the depth or importance of a geometry class!</p>   


<p>In the same way a <term>carpenter</term> is helped by some formal training in <term>geometry</term>, <em>most roles</em> are helped with have some formal training in <em>humor</em>.</p>

 <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">For instance:</p> 
    <p class="considertext"><callback>How could a traffic engineer incorporate "joy" or "humor" into an analysis?</callback> This question probably doesn't really make sense to us! We might even wonder if this even <sem-weak>could</sem-weak> be a legitimate topic of analysis.</p> 
            
     <p class="considertext">By contrast, the question would make perfect sense if we had asked about analyzing "safety"&mdash;since we're used to thinking of <term>safety</term> as tangible, and <em>joy</em> as <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> tangible.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When we think about it, we can chose <term>road A</term> or <term>road  B</term> based on our expectation of <term>safety</term>. We can also chose <em>activity A</em> or <em>activity B</em> based on our expectation of <em>joy</em>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We make these tangible decisions all the time, for routes as well as hobbies&mdash;because joy and safety <sem>both</sem> have analytic possibilities. We're just underequipped when it comes to joy.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">This underarmament for joy is the reason that many of us feel it's grating, inappropriate, or not legitimate to take joy formally&mdash;we lack the tools to handle it to the standards we're used to elsewhere.</p>
    </div> 


 
<p>The goal of this book is to make humor and joy as tangible and thinkable as anything else.</p>

<p>So let's pull the sword from the stone, and go on an  adventure into a strange and wonderful science&mdash;and better learn to wield a fundamental force and power in our lives.</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>


<p>This involves thinking about things&mdash;including humor&mdash;in new ways. We'll be learning about <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>, which looks at the causes </p> 

<p>We'll notice that we're in the habit of thinking about <term>negative</term> emotions instead of <em>positive</em> ones. A school might track sadness more than joy. From a problem amelioration standpoint, this makes a degree of sense.</p>
                                      
    <p>However, one consequence of this is that <term>negative</term> things become <term>tangible</term>, while <em>positive</em> things like joy become <em>hard</em> to think about. That's why most of us find it initially easier to think through chronic misery than chronic joy.</p> 
    
 <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">It's easier to make a pitch based on the <term>presence</term> of <term>negative</term> things <callback>(students are stressed)</callback> than it is on the <em>absence</em> of <em>positive</em> things <callback>(students aren't joyful)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">There's a lot to unpack there, but for now we can notice two things.</p> 
           
    <p class="considertext">The first is that it's like an algorithm for mediocre outcomes. Imagine a function that adds to any number less than zero. It'll never go higher than zero!</p>
            
    <p class="considertext">The second is that this also isn't often a choice: since we can't always think functionally about joy, we're not <sem-weak>choosing</sem-weak> our approach&mdash;we're pushed into a single method.</p>
</div> 
               
<p>There's a long, long history of joy being ignored. Just think about medieval ideas of heaven and hell. </p>

<p>
 Hell was described in <term>tangible</term> metaphors <callback>(being boiled in a pot, stabbed with poles, tormented by ugly people, wandering wastelands, and so on)</callback>. However, heaven was described in <em>intangible</em> metaphors <callback>(bright lights, clouds, a collection of pious saints, a metaphorical throne, and so on)</callback>.</p> 

<p>It's an apples to oranges comparison! To make a consistent contrast, either hell could be intangible <callback>(hell is darkness)</callback>, or heaven could be tangible <callback>(heaven is being loved by wonderful people in beautiful forests)</callback>.</p> 
    

<p>If <term>hell</term> has <term>vivid</term> metaphors for negative states, <em>heaven</em> has pretty <em>blank</em> metaphors for positive states. While we could make things hellish, it's much odder to think about making things heavenly. This is so normal to us that it probably flies under our radar.</p>
   
 
  
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      
    <p class="considertext">If hell is wandering around burnt wastelands, then heaven would probably be wandering around beautiful valleys and forests and shores. Despite this, most of us associate wastelands with hell more than forests with heaven.</p>
      </div>
      
<p>And so we have two tracks: hell is imagined in <term>earthly</term> analogies, in a way analagous to <term>misery</term>, while heaven is imagined in <em>otherworldly</em> abstraction, in a way <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> analagous to <em>joy</em>.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If we unhinged our imagination for joy like we can for misery, what comes to mind? Maybe spending loving time with beautiful people; enjoying feasts; drinking alcohol; winning games; thriving in the absence of rulers; being admired; roving gardens; exploring beautiful landscapes, towns, cities; hot baths and nice beds; not working; and so on.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Despite this, these aren't involved in metaphors for medieval heaven, in part because those things were often frowned upon by religious authorities&mdash;who often said joys like freedom of travel and sexuality; abundance; luxuries; and so on were actually earthly roads to hell.</p>
        
    <p class="considertext">
        So what remains of a metaphor for heaven, if not earthly joys? Well&mdash;clouds, light, saints, and so on.    
    </p>
    </div>

   
    Sword of joy is making joy tangible. 

    
 

<p>Okay, let's move past heaven and hell to think about actual life&mdash;what are chronic states of joy and misery like?</p>

<p>Like hell, it's probably easy to imagine chronic misery. We think of garbage and pollution, disease, loud noises, compounding debts, lack of sleep, stress, and so on.</p>

<p>But like heaven, it's probably harder to imagine chronic joy. We often spend a long time thinking about negative states <callback>(poverty, life expectancy, pollution, and so on)</callback> that we don't always have words for positive states. Often, we often use very bland words <callback>("satisfaction")</callback>.</p>

<p>However, when thinking about chronic joy, we often have a sense that it involves smiling and laughing. People who are chronically joyful would be smiling easily and laugh frequently.</p>

<p>This is where it gets trick, though&mdash;we get to a road block with smiling and laughing, because we often don’t have a good idea of them, and there are some pretty powerful blocks stopping us from thinking about them widely.</p>

Let’s do a survey. COMEDY. Has anyone here ever smiled and laughed at jokes? Has anyone NOT laughed at jokes?
