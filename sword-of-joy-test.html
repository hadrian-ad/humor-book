<p class="subtitle">A Wielder's Guide to Humor</p>       
</div>

<h2>1. Sword from the Stone</h2>


<p>This is a book about pulling a sword from a stone&mdash;a sword called <vocab>joy</vocab>. And once pulled out, we'll learn how to actually <sem-weak>wield</sem-weak> that sword. </p>
  
<p>Wielding the sword of joy&mdash;we'll call that <vocab>humor</vocab>. This wielder's guide will help us gain a greater mastery over the domains of humor&mdash;transitions, changes, merges, separations, and more.</p>

        <p class="considertext">In this way of thinking, joy is dynamic and transformative. Peace is a stable state. One of the mechanisms that change this state is joy.</p> </div>
        -->
        <p>Most of us are untrained swordsman when it comes to humor. That's good enough, much of the time&mdash;but sometimes we become overconfident. Since we've been swinging that sword around all our life, we can start to think there's nothing more to learn about swordplay. That's completely wrong!</p>

        
        
        
<div class="consider">

          <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
                          
           <p class="considertext">Humor is one of the secret sciences&mdash;it's simply not taught!</p> 
                   
            <p class="considertext">It's likely you've had formal instruction in all kinds of things, whether that's  <term>geometry</term>, <term>working out</term>, <term>British literature</term>, <term>baking</term>, or so on&mdash;but it's likely you've never had formal instruction on <em>humor</em>.</p>          
          
          <p class="considertext">Skipping humor as field of study has compounding disadvantages&mdash;often in ways we don't even realize until we undergo the study!</p>
    </div>
       
   <p>So let's pull the sword from the stone&mdash;and go on an  adventure into a strange and wonderful science. By talking seriously about joy and humor, we'll  better learn to wield a fundamental force and power in our lives.</p> 
       
     <p>  Eventually, who knows?&mdash;maybe we can put the world to the sword, and rip it apart through joy.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">
       
       We often don't notice that information about humor is withheld from us&mdash;it seems normal that middle schoolers have lessons on Shakespeare but not joy or humor.
       </p> 
       
       <p class="considertext">In part, that's because we've accepted myths about humor&mdash;like that humor can't be taught. But this usually describes the <term>speaker</term> more than anything to do about <em>humor</em>: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback></p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">Other times, we see apparent complexity and feel helpless: <callback>"since people laugh at different things, we shouldn't think about it."</callback>
    </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">These are two common but oversized ideas about humor we'll be rightsizing in this book.</p>


</div>
 
 <h2>2. The Underarmament of Joy</h2>
  

<p>In the fight for joy, most of us are simply underequipped. The main problem is that we simply don't understand joy or humor well enough for applied, functional tasks.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">It's a bit like how we can do quite a bit with squares and triangles intuitively&mdash;but eventually, not knowing any geometry  puts a limit on our ability to make descriptions or applied decisions.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes we don't notice our lack of next-level skills in joy or humor because we all do have our intuitive understanding&mdash;it's like how tossing around a baseball doesn't make us think about how we don't have a physics degree.</p> 

<p>Of course, when we think about it, we can notice how tossing around a baseball doesn't ensure we can  measure, compare, or describe the movement of baseballs&mdash;let alone build rollercoasters or planes.</p>

<p>That's obvious with <term>physics</term>&mdash;but when it comes to <em>joy</em>, we sometimes don't even think higher skills <sem-weak>exist</sem-weak>. We can see by comparing two questions:</p>
<ul class="close-list">

    <li>
        <callback>"How could a traffic engineer incorporate <term>safety</term> into an analysis?"</callback>
    </li><li>
         
        <callback>"How could a traffic engineer incorporate <em>joy</em> or <em>humor</em> into an analysis?"</callback>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It's likely the <term>first</term> question about <term>safety</term> makes sense to us. It's likely the <em>second</em> question on <em>joy</em> does not. We might wonder if joy or humor even <sem-weak>could</sem-weak> be a legitimate topic of analysis.</p>

<p>Of course, when we actually pause to think about this, it doesn't really make sense. In our day-to-day lives, we can choose between <term>road A</term> or <term>road B</term> based on our expectation of <term>safety</term>. We can also choose between <em>activity A</em> or <em>activity B</em> based on our expectation of <em>joy</em>.</p>

<p>We make these tangible decisions all the time! That's because joy and safety <sem>both</sem> have analytic possibilities. We're just equipped with tools to think through safety, and underequipped with tools when it comes to thinking through joy.</p>

<p>This <vocab>underamament for joy</vocab> is the reason  many of us feel talking about "joy" or "humor" is grating, inappropriate, illegitimate, and so on. We lack the tools <callback>(definitions, models, theory, metrics, observational practice)</callback> to handle these things to the same standards we're used to elsewhere.</p>

<p>This has pretty dire consequences. If people are unable to design for joy, we'll be living grossly. And if you're unable to evaluate joy or humor, you'll find it hard to speak for something we all find important in our lives.</p>

<p>That's why this book is here to give us tangible arms for joy&mdash;and make humor and joy as tangible and thinkable as anything else.</p>



<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Since we all have an intuitive understanding of joy and humor, we don't always notice how much we don't know&mdash;like how tossing around a baseball doesn't make us think we need a physics degree.</p> 

<p class="considertext">At the same time, when it's pointed out, we readily know that tossing around a baseball doesn't mean we know how to measure, compare, or describe the movement of baseballs&mdash;let alone build trebuchets, rollercoasters, or planes.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">There's something similar to humor&mdash;where simply laughing with friends doesn't always mean we know how to go about thinking through everything about joy, including on larger scales&mdash;like gardens, campuses, cities, statewide policy, and so on.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">One component of this book will be thinking about "genuine" joy. A traffic engineer will be able to identify things that people think <sem-weak>should</sem-weak> give safety, but don't. In the same way, a joy engineer will be able to identify the things people think <sem-weak>should</sem-weak> give joy, but don't. </p>
    
    </div>
    
<!--
  <p>Finally, we sometimes make assumptions we're not in a position to evaluate. As high schoolers, we probably thought squares and triangles were the simplist kind of shapes. That didn't mean we were in a position to judge the depth or importance of a geometry class!</p>   


<p>In the same way a <term>carpenter</term> is helped by some formal training in <term>geometry</term>, <em>most roles</em> are helped with have some formal training in <em>humor</em>.</p> 

        <!--
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>    
        <p class="considertext">It would be a bit like thinking a geometry class has nothing to contribute, since we've been around squares and triangles all our lives. But, in fact, geometry class has a lot to contribute to our understanding of things!</p> </div>
        -->


<h2>3. The Subtle War on Joy</h2>

<p>There's been long conflict over joy and humor. This has been a subtle war&mdash;the method of diminuation has been to keep <term>negative emotions</term> as <term>tangible</term>, while keeping <em>positive emotions</em> as <em>abstract</em>.</p>

 
   <p>
 Just think about heaven and hell&mdash;<term>hell</term> was described in <term>tangible</term> metaphors <callback>(being boiled in a pot, stabbed with poles, tormented by ugly people, wandering through wastelands, and so on)</callback>, while <em>heaven</em> was described in <em>intangible</em> metaphors <callback>(bright lights, clouds, a collection of pious saints, a metaphorical throne, and so on)</callback>.</p> 
 
 

<p>This sets up an apples to oranges comparison! They're presented as opposites, but are actually two different things.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">To be consistent, they should either both be intangible <callback>(hell is darkness, heaven is lightness)</callback> or both tangible <callback>(hell is being tormented by horrible people; heaven is being loved by wonderful people)</callback>.</p> 
    
<p class="considertext
   ">Instead, we often see them being mixed&mdash;hell is being tormented <callback>(tangible)</callback>, heaven is light <callback>(abstract)</callback>&mdash;creating an unworkable comparison.</p>
    </div>
    
    
<p>And so we have two tracks: hell is imagined in <term>earthly</term> analogies, in a way analagous to <term>misery</term> <callback>(wastelands)</callback>, while heaven is imagined in <em>otherworldly</em> abstraction, in a way <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> analagous to <em>joy</em> <callback>(forests and gardens)</callback>.</p> 
 
 
<p>The reason this is relevant: it helps us see that we do the same thing in actual life!</p> 

<p>When we think about  chronic states of misery and joy, it's probably <term>easy</term> for us to picture chronic <term>misery</term><callback> (garbage, pollution, disease, loud noises, compounding debts, lack of sleep, stress, and so on)</callback> and <em>harder</em> to picture chronic <em>joy</em>&mdash;since we don't think of access to trees as joyful in the same way we think of the presence of garbage is miserable. 
</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">
    
Similarly to how we relate <term>heaven</term> to abstract things <callback>(light)</callback>, we tend to relate <em>chronic joy</em> to abstract things too <callback>(self-actualization)</callback>.</p>
    
<p class="considertext">This can lead to an unwieldy way of thinking and talking about joy, even while we have an extremely accessible way of talking about misery. 
   
   </p> 
    
    </div>

<p>We are often so practiced in thinking about negative states  that we don't always have words for positive states. Often, we often use very bland words <callback>("satisfaction")</callback>.</p>

<p>When we try to think tangibly about chronic joy, we often have a sense that it involves smiling and laughing&mdash;people who are chronically joyful would smile easily and laugh frequently.</p>

<p>This is where it gets tricky, though. We actually don't always have as good a grasp on smiling and laughing as we think at first&mdash;and there are some pretty significant road blocks to getting a handle on them.</p>

<p>Sometimes this has to do with the ambiguities we feel exist in laughter&mdash;like when people laugh at other people getting hurt. Other times, it's a lack of understanding of patterns to when and why we laugh. Finally, sometimes it's simply an observation issue, where we actually don't even notice many of the smiles and laughs around us.</p>

<p>One of the goals of this book is to pick up some arms to join in this long war on joy&mdash;and not in a way that is abstract and riddled with incoherence, but in a way that is tangible and coherent. </p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">It's hard to talk about joy without also talking about the ways in which people don't want you to have it. Medieval ideas of heaven and hell are also instructive here.</p> 
      
      <p class="considertext">If worldly torments are an analogy for hell, then worldly pleasures would be an analogy for heaven&mdash;but often these wordly pleasures were denounced as being bad and therefore not heavenly.<p>
         
     <p class="considertext">If heaven had too much of a worldly paralel,  worldly torments are an analogy for hell, then worldly pleasures would be an analogy for heaven&mdash;but often these wordly pleasures were denounced as being bad.<p>
    
        <p class="considertext">This means heaven isn't like spending loving time with beautiful people; enjoying feasts; drinking alcohol; winning games; thriving in the absence of rulers; being appreciated; roving gardens; exploring beautiful landscapes, towns, cities; learning; hot baths and nice beds; not working; and so on.</p>
        
    <p class="considertext">Despite this, these aren't always involved in metaphors for heaven, in part because "heavenly" things like freedom of travel and sexuality; abundance; luxuries; beautiful environments; and so on were actually earthly roads to hell.</p>
            
        <p class="considertext">
            So what remains of a metaphor for heaven, if not earthly joys? Well&mdash;clouds, light, saints, and so on. Many of us grew up in a cultural context that overdescribed negative things, and underdescribed positive things.    
        </p>
        
        <p class="considertext">
            Something similar happens today&mdash;where self-directed efforts aren't seen as aspirational. 
            
            So what remains of a metaphor for heaven, if not earthly joys? Well&mdash;clouds, light, saints, and so on. Many of us grew up in a cultural context that overdescribed negative things, and underdescribed positive things.    
        </p>
        
    </div>



<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">For instance: </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Originally, the word "bliss" meant something like joy. Bliss was something you felt with your friends.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Of course, overtime, the meaning of bliss became more and more abstract and otherworldly&mdash;until it became a positive state only achievable after death.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">At that point, bliss can only be used as a kind of surreal metaphor&mdash;and therefore nonfunctional when it comes to using bliss as the basis for a critique or goal.</p>
        
    </div>



 <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">It's easier to make a pitch based on the <term>presence</term> of <term>negative</term> things <callback>(students are stressed)</callback> than it is to make a pitch on the <em>absence</em> of <em>positive</em> things <callback>(students aren't joyful)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">There's a lot to unpack there, but for now we can notice two things.</p> 
           
    <p class="considertext">The first is that it's like an algorithm for mediocre outcomes. Imagine a function that adds to any number less than zero. It'll never go higher than zero!</p>
            
    <p class="considertext">The second is that this also isn't often a choice. Since we can't always think functionally about joy, we're not <sem-weak>choosing</sem-weak> our approach&mdash;we're pushed into a single method. This lack of flexibility is limiting.</p>
    
   <p class="considertext"><callback>"Who would want to live in a world that was not quite fatal?"</callback> the environmentalist Rachel Carlson wrote on efforts where the final goal was to avoid worst case scenarios.</p>
   
    <p class="considertext">We can measure by better case scenarios&mdash;so not just reducing isolation, but promoting connection; not just lessoning misery, but building joy. </p> 
</div> 


<h2>4. Comedy isn't particularly important</h2>

<p>So if our sense of chronic joy is very loosely associated with easy laughing and smiling, we need to think about smiling and laughing. Maybe surprisingly, this is does not mean we need to think about comedy or jokes.</p>

<p>Let's think about this. Have you ever laughed at a joke?</p>


<p>Have you ever <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> laughed at a joke?</p>

<p>How about other things&mdash;have you ever laughed at: </p>

<p>Since we both do and don't laugh at jokes, it's not the <sem-weak>joke</sem-weak> we're interested&mdash;it's something about why we do or don't laugh. And not just for jokes, but for everything. This is the focus of this book.</p>

<p>As we understand this dynamic&mdash;of when and why we smile and laugh&mdash;we'll get closer to unlocking tangible ideas about joy.</p>
 
<p>Learning to orient away from comedy is hard, but very important to seeing the big picture. Which came first, laughing, or sitcoms? We want to be careful about trying to work backward&mdash;about trying to use sitcoms to figure out laughing. </p>
 
<p>This is obvious in other cases. Which came first, eating or restaurants? Should we try to understand eating in terms of being restaurantic&mdash;or would that be a strange case of working backwards? It's the same for humor and comedy, where it's not always useful to see smiling and laughing as "comedic."</p> 

 <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">Joy isn't always good. Everyone has instances of people smiling or laughing when something horrible was happening. We want to understand this too.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Similarly, joy isn't simple. It's not some kind of happily ever after. It's complicated, and co-exists. </p>            
</div> 
 


<h2>4. Humor dynamics</h2>

<p>Essentially, it's like the difference between learning about addition and multiplication in elementary school, and learning about algebra in middle school. The approach is different&mdash;it's looser and more functional, and helps makes sense of things as a whole. </p>

<p>This involves thinking about things&mdash;including humor&mdash;in new ways. We'll be learning about <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>, which looks at the causes </p> 


       
 
   
<p>Sword of joy is making joy tangible. </p>
