       <p class="overtitle">Sword of Joy</p>
<p class="subtitle">A Wielder's Guide to Humor</p>       
</div>

<h2>1. Sword from the Stone</h2>

<p>This is a book about pulling a sword from a stone&mdash;a sword called <vocab>joy</vocab>. And once pulled out, it's about actually <sem-weak>wielding</sem-weak> that sword. </p>
  
    <p>We'll call wielding the sword of joy <vocab>humor</vocab>. This guide will help us gain a greater degree of mastery over  transitions, changes, and other elements that make up humor.</p>

        <p>Most of us are untrained swordsman when it comes to humor&mdash;but since we've been swinging that sword around all our life, we can sometimes become  overconfident. We think there's nothing more to learn about swordplay. That's completely wrong!</p>
        
        

        
<div class="consider">

          <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
                          
           <p class="considertext">Humor is one of the secret sciences&mdash;it's simply not taught. Most of us have had instruction in all kinds of things, ranging from <term>geometry</term> to <term>working out</term> to <term>baking</term> to <term>British literature</term>, and so on&mdash;but we've probably never had formal instruction on <em>humor</em>. Which is a bit odd, when we think about it!</p>
                    
          
          <p class="considertext">Skipping humor as field of study has compounding disadvantages&mdash;often in ways we don't even realize until we undergo the study.</p>
    </div>
       
   <p>So let's pull the sword from the stone, and go on an  adventure into a strange and wonderful science&mdash;and better learn to wield a fundamental force and power in our lives. Eventually, we can put the world to the sword.</p>
        
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">
        Many of us have internalized myths about humor&mdash;like that humor can't be taught. This is usually is just a self-reference: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback></p> 
        
    
        <p class="considertext">Other times, we feel helpless in the face of apparent complexity. <callback>"Since people laugh at different things, we shouldn't think about it."</callback>
    </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">These are two common ideas about humor we'll be pushing through in this book.</p>
 

</div>
 
 <h2>2. The Underarmament of Joy</h2>
  
<p>For most of us, there's a fundamental problem to our understanding of joy and humor: it's often insufficient for functional tasks.</p>

<p>We can compare two questions:</p>
<ul class="close-list">
    
    <li>
        <callback>"How could a traffic engineer incorporate <term>safety</term> into an analysis?"</callback>
    </li><li>
         
        <callback>"How could a traffic engineer incorporate <em>joy</em> or <em>humor</em> into an analysis?"</callback>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It's likely the <term>first</term> question makes sense to us&mdash;it's likely the <em>second</em> one doesn't. We might wonder if joy or humor even could be a legitimate topic of analysis.</p>



<p>Of course, when we think about it, this doesn't really make sense. In our day-to-day lives, we can choose between <term>road A</term> or <term>road B</term> based on our expectation of <term>safety</term>. We can also choose between <em>activity A</em> or <em>activity B</em> based on our expectation of <em>joy</em>.</p>

<p>We make these tangible decisions all the time! That's because joy and safety <sem>both</sem> have analytic possibilities. We're just underequipped when it comes to joy.</p>

<p>This <vocab>underamament for joy</vocab> is the reason  many of us feel talking about "joy" or "humor" is grating, inappropriate, illegitimate, and so on: we lack the tools <callback>(definitions, models, theory, metrics, observational practice)</callback> to handle these things to the same standards we're used to elsewhere.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">By default, we tend to think of <term>safety</term> as <term>tangible</term>, and <em>joy</em> as <em><outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> tangible</em>. Of course, that's not true&mdash;we can tell when a room has more joy than another room.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We can even, with some careful thought, tell which room is more conducive to joy.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The goal of this book is to make humor and joy as tangible and thinkable as anything else.</p>
    
    </div>
    
<!--
  <p>Finally, we sometimes make assumptions we're not in a position to evaluate. As high schoolers, we probably thought squares and triangles were the simplist kind of shapes. That didn't mean we were in a position to judge the depth or importance of a geometry class!</p>   


<p>In the same way a <term>carpenter</term> is helped by some formal training in <term>geometry</term>, <em>most roles</em> are helped with have some formal training in <em>humor</em>.</p> 

        <!--
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>    
        <p class="considertext">It would be a bit like thinking a geometry class has nothing to contribute, since we've been around squares and triangles all our lives. But, in fact, geometry class has a lot to contribute to our understanding of things!</p> </div>
        -->


<h2>3. The Subtle War on Joy</h2>

<p>There's been subtle conflict over joy. This conflict has played out by treating <term>positive emotions</term> as <term>abstract</term>, but <em>negative emotions</em> as <em>tangible</em>. </p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">For instance: </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Originally, the word "bliss" meant something like joy. Overtime, bliss left the world to became something abstract and otherworldly&mdash;a positive state only achievable after death.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">At that point, it doesn't make sense to suggest that a job or college course or sidewalk should bring people "bliss"&mdash;it would cause people to laugh and not take you seriously.</p>
        
    </div>

<p>There's a long history of joy being hidden under the bed or held out of reach. Take heaven or hell. <term>Hell</term> has <term>vivid</term> metaphors for negative states, <em>heaven</em> has pretty <em>blank</em> metaphors for positive states.
    </p>
    
    <p>
 <term>Hell</term> was described in <term>tangible</term> metaphors <callback>(being boiled in a pot, stabbed with poles, tormented by ugly people, wandering wastelands, and so on)</callback>. Meanwhile, <em>heaven</em> was described in <em>intangible</em> metaphors <callback>(bright lights, clouds, a collection of pious saints, a metaphorical throne, and so on)</callback>.</p> 

<p>This sets up an apples to oranges comparison! To be consistent, they could either both be intangible <callback>(hell is darkness)</callback> or both tangible <callback>(heaven is being loved by wonderful people in beautiful forests)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p>That arrangement makes it easy to focus on hell <callback>(we could make things hellish)</callback>, and slippery to focus on heaven <callback>(is it possible to make things heavenly?)</callback>.</p> 

<p>While we could make things hellish, it's much odder to think about making things heavenly. This is so normal to us that it probably flies under our radar.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">An inversion of hell <callback>(worldly torments)</callback> would lead to a heaven <callback>(worldly pleasures)</callback> described like: spending loving time with beautiful people; enjoying feasts; drinking alcohol; winning games; thriving in the absence of rulers; being appreciated; roving gardens; exploring beautiful landscapes, towns, cities; learning; hot baths and nice beds; not working; and so on.</p>
        
    <p class="considertext">Despite this, these aren't always involved in metaphors for heaven, in part because "heavenly" things like freedom of travel and sexuality; abundance; luxuries; beautiful environments; and so on were actually earthly roads to hell.</p>
            
        <p class="considertext">
            So what remains of a metaphor for heaven, if not earthly joys? Well&mdash;clouds, light, saints, and so on. Many of us grew up in a cultural context that overdescribed negative things, and underdescribed positive things.    
        </p>
    </div>


  
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      
    <p class="considertext">If hell is wandering around burnt wastelands, then heaven would probably be wandering around beautiful valleys and forests and shores. Despite this, most of us associate wastelands with hell more than forests with heaven.</p>
      </div>
      
<p>And so we have two tracks: hell is imagined in <term>earthly</term> analogies, in a way analagous to <term>misery</term>, while heaven is imagined in <em>otherworldly</em> abstraction, in a way <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> analagous to <em>joy</em>.</p> 
 
 
<p>The reason this is relevant is that it helps us see that we do the same thing in actual life&mdash;when we think about chronic states of misery and joy.</p>

<p>Like hell, it's probably easy for us to imagine chronic misery. <callback>(Garbage, pollution, disease, loud noises, compounding debts, lack of sleep, stress, and so on.)</callback> But like heaven, it's probably much harder to imagine chronic joy.</p>

<p>We are often so practiced in thinking about negative states  that we don't always have words for positive states. Often, we often use very bland words <callback>("satisfaction")</callback>.</p>

<p>However, when thinking about chronic joy, we often have a sense that it involves smiling and laughing. People who are chronically joyful would be smiling easily and laugh frequently.</p>

<p>This is where it gets trick, though&mdash;we get to a road block with smiling and laughing, because we often don’t have a good idea of them, and there are some pretty powerful blocks stopping us from thinking about them widely.</p>


 <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">It's easier to make a pitch based on the <term>presence</term> of <term>negative</term> things <callback>(students are stressed)</callback> than it is to make a pitch on the <em>absence</em> of <em>positive</em> things <callback>(students aren't joyful)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">There's a lot to unpack there, but for now we can notice two things.</p> 
           
    <p class="considertext">The first is that it's like an algorithm for mediocre outcomes. Imagine a function that adds to any number less than zero. It'll never go higher than zero!</p>
            
    <p class="considertext">The second is that this also isn't often a choice. Since we can't always think functionally about joy, we're not <sem-weak>choosing</sem-weak> our approach&mdash;we're pushed into a single method. This lack of flexibility is limiting.</p>
    
   <p class="considertext"><callback>"Who would want to live in a world that was not quite fatal?"</callback> the environmentalist Rachel Carlson wrote on efforts where the final goal was to avoid worst case scenarios.</p>
   
    <p class="considertext">We can measure by better case scenarios&mdash;so not just reducing isolation, but promoting connection; not just lessoning misery, but building joy. </p> 
</div> 


<h2>4. Comedy isn't particularly important</h2>

<p>So if our sense of chronic joy is very loosely associated with easy laughing and smiling, we need to think about smiling and laughing. Maybe surprisingly, this is does not mean we need to think about comedy or jokes.</p>

<p>Let's think about this. Have you ever laughed at a joke?</p>


<p>Have you ever <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> laughed at a joke?</p>

<p>How about other things&mdash;have you ever laughed at: </p>

<p>Since we both do and don't laugh at jokes, it's not the <sem-weak>joke</sem-weak> we're interested&mdash;it's something about why we do or don't laugh. And not just for jokes, but for everything. This is the focus of this book.</p>

<p>As we understand this dynamic&mdash;of when and why we smile and laugh&mdash;we'll get closer to unlocking tangible ideas about joy.</p>
 
<p>Learning to orient away from comedy is hard, but very important to seeing the big picture. Which came first, laughing, or sitcoms? We want to be careful about trying to work backward&mdash;about trying to use sitcoms to figure out laughing. </p>
 
<p>This is obvious in other cases. Which came first, eating or restaurants? Should we try to understand eating in terms of being restaurantic&mdash;or would that be a strange case of working backwards? It's the same for humor and comedy, where it's not always useful to see smiling and laughing as "comedic."</p> 

 <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">Joy isn't always good. Everyone has instances of people smiling or laughing when something horrible was happening. We want to understand this too.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Similarly, joy isn't simple. It's not some kind of happily ever after. It's complicated, and co-exists. </p>            
</div> 
 


<h2>4. Humor dynamics</h2>

<p>Essentially, it's like the difference between learning about addition and multiplication in elementary school, and learning about algebra in middle school. The approach is different&mdash;it's looser and more functional, and helps makes sense of things as a whole. </p>

<p>This involves thinking about things&mdash;including humor&mdash;in new ways. We'll be learning about <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>, which looks at the causes </p> 


       
 
   
<p>Sword of joy is making joy tangible. </p>
