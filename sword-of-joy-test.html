       <p class="overtitle">Sword of Joy</p>
<p class="subtitle">A Wielder's Guide to Humor</p>       
</div>

<h2>1. Sword from the Stone</h2>


<p>This is a book about pulling a sword from a stone&mdash;a sword called <vocab>joy</vocab>. And once pulled out, it's about learning how to actually <sem-weak>wield</sem-weak> that sword. </p>
  
<p>We wield the sword of joy through <vocab>humor</vocab>, and this <book-title>Wielder's Guide to Humor</book-title> will help us gain a greater mastery over the domains of humor&mdash;things like  transitions, changes, merges, separations, and more.</p>

        <p>In this way of thinking, joy is dynamic and transformative. Peace is a stable state. One of the mechanisms that change this state is joy.</p> </div>
        -->
        
    <p>We've swing this sword around all our lives, but even so&mdash;most of us are untrained swordsman when it comes to humor. Since this is often good enough, we can become overconfident: we can start to think there's nothing more to learn about this swordplay. That's completely wrong!</p>

        
<div class="consider">

          <consider>Consider:</consider> 
                          
           <p>Humor is one of the secret sciences&mdash;it's simply not taught!</p> 
                   
            <p>It's likely you've had formal instruction in all kinds of things, whether that's  <term>geometry</term>, <term>working out</term>, <term>British literature</term>, <term>baking</term>, or so on&mdash;but it's likely you've never had formal instruction on <term2>humor</term2>.</p>          
          
          <p>Skipping humor as field of study has compounding disadvantages&mdash;often in ways we don't even realize until we undergo the study.</p>
    </div>
       
   <p>So let's pull the sword from the stone&mdash;and go on an  adventure into a strange and wonderful science. By talking seriously about joy and humor, we'll  better learn to wield a fundamental force and power in our lives.</p> 
       
     <p>  Eventually, who knows?&mdash;maybe we can put the world to the sword, and rip it apart through joy.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>
       
       It seems normal that middle schoolers have lessons on Shakespeare&mdash;but not joy or humor.
       </p> 
       
       <p>In part, that's because we've accepted myths about humor&mdash;like that humor can't be taught. But this usually describes the <term>speaker</term> more than anything describing <term2>humor</term2>: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback></p> 
        
        <p>Other times, we see apparent complexity and feel helpless: <callback>"since people laugh at different things, we shouldn't think about it."</callback>
    </p>
    
    <p>These are two common but inaccurate ideas about humor. We'll be going past them in this book!</p>


</div>
 
 <h2>2. The Underarmament of Joy</h2>
  

<p>Many of us are underequipped when it comes to joy&mdash;we simply don't understand joy or humor well enough for applied, functional tasks.</p>

<p>We can notice this by comparing two questions:</p>


<ul class="close-list">

    <li>
        <callback>"How could a traffic engineer incorporate <term>safety</term> into an analysis?"</callback>
    </li><li>
         
        <callback>"How could a traffic engineer incorporate <term2>joy</term2> or <term2>humor</term2> into an analysis?"</callback>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It's likely the first question about <term>safety</term> makes sense to us. It's likely the second question on <term2>joy</term2> does not&mdash;and may even seem stupid. In part, it's because we might wonder if joy or humor even <sem-weak>could</sem-weak> be a legitimate topic of analysis.</p>

<p>But <em>both</em> joy and safety have analytic possibilities&mdash;it's why, in our day-to-day lives, we can choose between two options based on our expectation of <term>safety</term>, just like we can choose between two choices options on our expectation of <term2>joy</term2>.</p>

<p>Even though we do this in our day-to-day lives, we don't always do this in broader projects&mdash;generally because we're <term>equipped</term> to think through <term>safety</term>, and <term2>underequipped</term2> when it comes to thinking through <term2>joy</term2>.</p>

<p>This <vocab>underamament for joy</vocab> is the reason  many of us feel talking about "joy" or "humor" is grating, inappropriate, illegitimate, and so on&mdash;we lack the tools <callback>(definitions, metrics, models, metrics, observational guidance, practice, theory, and so on)</callback> to handle something like joy to the same standards we're used to elsewhere.</p>

<p>That's why this book is written to give us armaments for thinking and talking about joy&mdash;to make humor and joy as tangible and thinkable as anything else.</p>



<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
    
    <p>Since we all have an intuitive understanding of joy and humor, we don't always notice how much we don't know&mdash;like how tossing around a baseball doesn't make us think we need a physics degree.</p> 

<p>At the same time, when it's pointed out, we readily know that tossing around a baseball doesn't mean we know how to measure, compare, or describe the movement of baseballs&mdash;let alone build trebuchets, rollercoasters, or planes.</p>
    
    <p>There's something similar to humor&mdash;where simply laughing with friends doesn't always mean we know how to go about thinking through everything about laughter, including on larger scales&mdash;like gardens, campuses, cities, statewide policy, and so on.</p>

    
    </div>

<div class="box">
            <p><headline>Genuineness.</headline> One component of this book will be thinking about "genuine" joy. In the same way a traffic engineer can identify things that people think <sem-weak>should</sem-weak> give safety, but don't&mdash;we should be able to identify the things people think <sem-weak>should</sem-weak> give joy, but don't.</p>
            
            <p>We're often rightfully skeptical of "applied joy" because it makes us think of somewhat dystopian efforts by Human Resources to present a vaneer of positivity, or find a mural on a wall to miss the point of why people are stressed, not happy.</p>
            
 <p>           Of course, if something makes us feel belittled, it's not making us feel joy, it's making us feel belittled. In this book, we'll be focusing on <sem-weak>actual</sem-weak> experiences of joy, not just the description of something as joyful.  </p>
        </div>
        
                
<!--
  <p>Finally, we sometimes make assumptions we're not in a position to evaluate. As high schoolers, we probably thought squares and triangles were the simplist kind of shapes. That didn't mean we were in a position to judge the depth or importance of a geometry class!</p>   


<p>In the same way a <term>carpenter</term> is helped by some formal training in <term>geometry</term>, <term2>most roles</term2> are helped with have some formal training in <term2>humor</term2>.</p> 

        <!--
<div class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>    
        <p>It would be a bit like thinking a geometry class has nothing to contribute, since we've been around squares and triangles all our lives. But, in fact, geometry class has a lot to contribute to our understanding of things!</p> </div>
        -->


<h2>3. The Subtle War on Joy</h2>

<p>It's not surprising that joy isn't seen as analytically legitimate, since here's been a very long war over joy and humor. One ongoing battle have been over how we think about chronic positive states.</p>


   <p>
 Just think about heaven and hell&mdash;<term>hell</term> was described in <term>tangible</term> metaphors <callback>(being tortured, burning, wandering through wastelands, and so on)</callback>, while <term2>heaven</term2> was described in <term2>intangible</term2> metaphors <callback>(bright lights, clouds, presence of a metaphorical throne, and so on)</callback>.</p> 

<p>And so we have two tracks: hell is imagined in <term>earthly</term> analogies, in a way analagous to <term>misery</term> <callback>(wastelands)</callback>, while heaven is imagined in <term2>otherworldly</term2> abstraction <callback>(light)</callback>, in a way <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> analagous to <term2>joy</term2> <callback>(forests and gardens)</callback>. </p> 

<p>This creates an apple to oranges comparison! The opposite of "light" isn't "wandering through a wasteland"  <callback>(<outcome-contrast>in</outcome-contrast>tangible metaphor compared to tangible metaphor)</callback>&mdash;and this apples to oranges comparison, as we'll see, creates an odd way of thinking about things in our own lives.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>To avoid unworkable comparisons, <em>both</em> ends of a comparison should consistently be either tangible or intangible: </p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
    <li>both <term>intangible</term> <callback>(hell is darkness, heaven is light)</callback> </li>

    <li>both <term2>tangible</term2> <callback>(hell is being tormented by horrible people; heaven is being loved by wonderful people)</callback></li>
    
    </ul>
    
      
    
<p class="considertext
   ">Instead, we often see the analogies  being mixed&mdash;hell is being tormented <callback>(tangible)</callback>, heaven is light <callback>(intangible)</callback>&mdash;creating an unworkable comparison.</p>
    </div>
  
<p>There's a reason this is relevant: we often do the same thing in our day-to-day life! </p>

<p>The strongest method of conflict is to create an apples to oranges comparison by presenting <term>negative emotions</term> as <term>tangible</term>, and <term2>positive emotions</term2> as <term2>abstract</term2>. 
</p>
 
<p>We often tend to think <term>concretely</term> about chronic states of <term>misery</term> <callback>(garbage, pollution, disease, loud noises, compounding debts, lack of sleep, stress, and so on)</callback>&mdash;and don't think that these stand-ins for misery are particularly different person-by-person as a matter of taste.</p>

<p>By contrast, we tend to think <term2>abstractly</term2> about chronic states of <term2>joy</term2> <callback>(self-actualization, fulfillment, opportunity, and so on)</callback>&mdash;and tend to think about joy as so individualized as to be not have proxies.</p>



<div class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>
    
Similarly to how we relate <term>heaven</term> to abstract things <callback>(light)</callback>, we tend to relate <term2>chronic joy</term2> to abstract things too <callback>(self-actualization)</callback>.</p>
    
<p>This can lead to an unwieldy way of thinking and talking about joy, even while we have an extremely accessible way of talking about misery. 
   </p> 

        <p>In other words, we don't tend to think of access to trees as an analogy for joy the same way we think the presence of garbage is an analogy for misery. </p>
            
    </div>





<p>We are often so practiced in thinking about negative states  that we don't always have words for positive states. Often, we often use very bland words <callback>("satisfaction")</callback>.</p>

<p>When we try to think tangibly about chronic joy, we often have a sense that it involves smiling and laughing&mdash;people who are chronically joyful would smile easily and laugh frequently.</p>

<p>This is where it gets tricky, though. We actually don't always have as good a grasp on smiling and laughing as we think at first&mdash;and there are some pretty significant road blocks to getting a handle on them.</p>

<p>Sometimes this has to do with the ambiguities we feel exist in laughter&mdash;like when people laugh at other people getting hurt. Other times, it's a lack of understanding of patterns to when and why we laugh. Finally, sometimes it's simply an observation issue, where we actually don't even notice many of the smiles and laughs around us.</p>

<p>One of the goals of this book is to pick up some arms to join in this long war on joy&mdash;and not in a way that is abstract and riddled with incoherence, but in a way that is tangible and coherent. </p>

<div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>It's hard to talk about joy without also talking about the ways in which people don't want you to have it. Medieval ideas of heaven and hell are also instructive here.</p> 
      
      <p>If worldly torments are an analogy for hell, then worldly pleasures would be an analogy for heaven&mdash;but often these wordly pleasures were denounced as being bad and therefore not heavenly.<p>
         
     <p>If heaven had too much of a worldly paralel,  worldly torments are an analogy for hell, then worldly pleasures would be an analogy for heaven&mdash;but often these wordly pleasures were denounced as being bad.<p>
    
        <p>This means heaven isn't like spending loving time with beautiful people; enjoying feasts; drinking alcohol; winning games; thriving in the absence of rulers; being appreciated; roving gardens; exploring beautiful landscapes, towns, cities; learning; hot baths and nice beds; not working; and so on.</p>
        
    <p>Despite this, these aren't always involved in metaphors for heaven, in part because "heavenly" things like freedom of travel and sexuality; abundance; luxuries; beautiful environments; and so on were actually earthly roads to hell.</p>
            
        <p>
            So what remains of a metaphor for heaven, if not earthly joys? Well&mdash;clouds, light, saints, and so on. Many of us grew up in a cultural context that overdescribed negative things, and underdescribed positive things.    
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Something similar happens today&mdash;where self-directed efforts aren't seen as aspirational. 
            
            So what remains of a metaphor for heaven, if not earthly joys? Well&mdash;clouds, light, saints, and so on. Many of us grew up in a cultural context that overdescribed negative things, and underdescribed positive things.    
        </p>
        
    </div>



<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">For instance: </p>
    
    <p>Originally, the word "bliss" meant something like joy. Bliss was something you felt with your friends.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, overtime, the meaning of bliss became more and more abstract and otherworldly&mdash;until it became a positive state only achievable after death.</p>
    
    <p>At that point, bliss can only be used as a kind of surreal metaphor&mdash;and therefore nonfunctional when it comes to using bliss as the basis for a critique or goal.</p>
        
    </div>



 <div class="consider">
        
    <consider>Consider:</consider> 
    <p>It's easier to make a pitch based on the <term>presence</term> of <term>negative</term> things <callback>(students are stressed)</callback> than it is to make a pitch on the <term2>absence</term2> of <term2>positive</term2> things <callback>(students aren't joyful)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p>There's a lot to unpack there, but for now we can notice two things.</p> 
           
    <p>The first is that it's like an algorithm for mediocre outcomes. Imagine a function that adds to any number less than zero. It'll never go higher than zero!</p>
            
    <p>The second is that this also isn't often a choice. Since we can't always think functionally about joy, we're not <sem-weak>choosing</sem-weak> our approach&mdash;we're pushed into a single method. This lack of flexibility is limiting.</p>
    
   <p><callback>"Who would want to live in a world that was not quite fatal?"</callback> the environmentalist Rachel Carlson wrote on efforts where the final goal was to avoid worst case scenarios.</p>
   
    <p>We can measure by better case scenarios&mdash;so not just reducing isolation, but promoting connection; not just lessoning misery, but building joy. </p> 
</div> 


<h2>4. Comedy isn't particularly important</h2>

<p>So if our sense of chronic joy is very loosely associated with easy laughing and smiling, we need to think about smiling and laughing. Maybe surprisingly, this is does not mean we need to think about comedy or jokes.</p>

<p>Let's think about this. Have you ever laughed at a joke?</p>


<p>Have you ever <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> laughed at a joke?</p>

<p>How about other things&mdash;have you ever laughed at: </p>

<p>Since we both do and don't laugh at jokes, it's not the <sem-weak>joke</sem-weak> we're interested&mdash;it's something about why we do or don't laugh. And not just for jokes, but for everything. This is the focus of this book.</p>

<p>As we understand this dynamic&mdash;of when and why we smile and laugh&mdash;we'll get closer to unlocking tangible ideas about joy.</p>
 
<p>Learning to orient away from comedy is hard, but very important to seeing the big picture. Which came first, laughing, or sitcoms? We want to be careful about trying to work backward&mdash;about trying to use sitcoms to figure out laughing. </p>
 
<p>This is obvious in other cases. Which came first, eating or restaurants? Should we try to understand eating in terms of being restaurantic&mdash;or would that be a strange case of working backwards? It's the same for humor and comedy, where it's not always useful to see smiling and laughing as "comedic."</p> 

 <div class="consider">
        
    <consider>Consider:</consider> 
    <p>Joy isn't always good. Everyone has instances of people smiling or laughing when something horrible was happening. We want to understand this too.</p> 
    
    <p>Similarly, joy isn't simple. It's not some kind of happily ever after. It's complicated, and co-exists. </p>            
</div> 
 


<h2>4. Humor dynamics</h2>

<p>Essentially, it's like the difference between learning about addition and multiplication in elementary school, and learning about algebra in middle school. The approach is different&mdash;it's looser and more functional, and helps makes sense of things as a whole. </p>

<p>This involves thinking about things&mdash;including humor&mdash;in new ways. We'll be learning about <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>, which looks at the causes </p> 


       
 
   
<p>Sword of joy is making joy tangible. </p>
