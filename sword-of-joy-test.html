       <p class="overtitle">Sword of Joy</p>
<p class="subtitle">A Wielder's Guide to Humor</p>       
</div>



<p>This is a book about pulling a sword from a stone&mdash;a sword called <sem>joy</sem>. And more than that, it's about actually <sem-weak>wielding</sem-weak> that sword, once pulled out.</p>
  
<p>We'll call the wielding the sword of joy <vocab>humor</vocab>. To gain proficiency in this sword, we'll be learning a thoughtful, analytical model of humor&mdash;with the goal of gaining cutting insight a</p> 
 
    <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">We'll be defining how we're using a words like "humor" soon. Hang tight!  
          </p> 
        </div>     
    
<p>We sometimes think that we don't need to learn about humor, since we all have so much experience with it. But that's a bit like thinking that, since we can naturally swing a sword around&mdash;or see others do so&mdash; there's nothing more to learn about swordplay. That's completely wrong!</p> 
 
<p>Most of us are untrained swordsman when it comes to humor. It's likely you've had a formal course on geometry at some point&mdash;it's <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> likely you've had a formal course on humor.</p> 

<p>Skipping this field of study has compounding disadvantages, often in ways we don't realize until we go through it.</p>

<div class="consider">
    
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">A middle schooler may think squares and triangles are the simplest, most familiar things in the world. And in some ways, that's true&mdash;but that doesn't mean that geometry is a redundant class for them.</p>
     
     <p class="considertext">It's the same for humor, where in some ways smiling and laughing are the simplest, most familiar things in the world&mdash;that doesn't mean instruction in humor is redundant.</p></div>

<p>Our understanding of joy and humor are usually insufficient as soon as we have a functional task. This starts as soon as we ask <callback>"what is humor?"</callback> and compounds from there&mdash;like trying to build a castle on sand.</p> 
 
<p>The goal of this book is to transition you from an <term>insufficient</term> understanding of humor to a <em>sufficient</em> one.</p>

 <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">For instance:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">How could a traffic engineer incorporate "joy" or "humor" into an analysis? This question probably doesn't really make sense to us! We might even question whether this would even be a legitimate topic of analysis.</p> 
            
    <p class="considertext">By contrast, it would make perfect sense if we had asked about "safety"  instead&mdash;since we're used to thinking of <term>safety</term> as tangible, and <em>joy</em> as <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> tangible.
    
    <p class="considertext">But that's not quite right. In our life, we can choose between two routes or designs based on expectation of safety. We can also choose between two activities based on expectation of joy. We make these tangible decisions all the time.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">There are similar analytic possibilities&mdash;we're just underequipped when it comes to joy, where thinking about it formally feels like grating or like driving through sand.</p>
    </div> 


<p>When we learn about humor&mdash;the sword of joy&mdash;we learn about how to actually think about and apply joy in the world, and what this means.</p>

<p>This involves thinking about things&mdash;including humor&mdash;in new ways. We'll be learning about <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>, which looks at the causes </p> 

<p>It'll be an adventure in learning how to see and wield one of our fundamental powers&mdash;an important pilgrimage through our day-to-day life to come to understand the force of smiling and laughing more clearly.  </p>

<p>We'll notice that we're in the habit of thinking about <term>negative</term> emotions instead of <em>positive</em> ones. A school might track sadness more than joy. From a problem amelioration standpoint, this makes a degree of sense.</p>
                                      
    <p>However, one consequence of this is that <term>negative</term> things become <term>tangible</term>, while <em>positive</em> things like joy become <em>hard</em> to think about. That's why most of us find it initially easier to think through chronic misery than chronic joy.</p> 
    
 <div class="consider">
        
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">It's easier to make a pitch based on the <term>presence</term> of <term>negative</term> things <callback>(students are stressed)</callback> than it is on the <em>absence</em> of <em>positive</em> things <callback>(students aren't joyful)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">There's a lot to unpack there, but for now we can notice two things.</p> 
           
    <p class="considertext">The first is that it's like an algorithm for mediocre outcomes. Imagine a function that adds to any number less than zero. It'll never go higher than zero!</p>
            
    <p class="considertext">The second is that this also isn't often a choice: since we can't always think functionally about joy, we're not <sem-weak>choosing</sem-weak> our approach&mdash;we're pushed into a single method.</p>
</div> 
               
<p>There's a long, long history of joy being ignored. Just think about medieval ideas of heaven and hell. </p>

<p>
 Hell was described in <term>tangible</term> metaphors <callback>(being boiled in a pot, stabbed with poles, tormented by ugly people, wandering wastelands, and so on)</callback>. However, heaven was described in <em>intangible</em> metaphors <callback>(bright lights, clouds, a collection of pious saints, a metaphorical throne, and so on)</callback>.</p> 

<p>It's an apples to oranges comparison! To make a consistent contrast, either hell could be intangible <callback>(hell is darkness)</callback>, or heaven could be tangible <callback>(heaven is being loved by wonderful people in beautiful forests)</callback>.</p> 
    

<p>If <term>hell</term> has <term>vivid</term> metaphors for negative states, <em>heaven</em> has pretty <em>blank</em> metaphors for positive states. While we could make things hellish, it's much odder to think about making things heavenly. This is so normal to us that it probably flies under our radar.</p>
   
 
  
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      
    <p class="considertext">If hell is wandering around burnt wastelands, then heaven would probably be wandering around beautiful valleys and forests and shores. Despite this, most of us associate wastelands with hell more than forests with heaven.</p>
      </div>
      
<p>And so we have two tracks: hell is imagined in <term>earthly</term> analogies, in a way analagous to <term>misery</term>, while heaven is imagined in <em>otherworldly</em> abstraction, in a way <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> analagous to <em>joy</em>.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If we unhinged our imagination for joy like we can for misery, what comes to mind? Maybe spending loving time with beautiful people; enjoying feasts; drinking alcohol; winning games; thriving in the absence of rulers; being admired; roving gardens; exploring beautiful landscapes, towns, cities; hot baths and nice beds; not working; and so on.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Despite this, these aren't involved in metaphors for medieval heaven, in part because those things were often frowned upon by religious authorities&mdash;who often said joys like freedom of travel and sexuality; abundance; luxuries; and so on were actually earthly roads to hell.</p>
        
    <p class="considertext">
        So what remains of a metaphor for heaven, if not earthly joys? Well&mdash;clouds, light, saints, and so on.    
    </p>
    </div>

   
    Sword of joy is making joy tangible. 

    
 

<p>Okay, let's move past heaven and hell to think about actual life&mdash;what are chronic states of joy and misery like?</p>

<p>Like hell, it's probably easy to imagine chronic misery. We think of garbage and pollution, disease, loud noises, compounding debts, lack of sleep, stress, and so on.</p>

<p>But like heaven, it's probably harder to imagine chronic joy. We often spend a long time thinking about negative states <callback>(poverty, life expectancy, pollution, and so on)</callback> that we don't always have words for positive states. Often, we often use very bland words <callback>("satisfaction")</callback>.</p>

<p>However, when thinking about chronic joy, we often have a sense that it involves smiling and laughing. People who are chronically joyful would be smiling easily and laugh frequently.</p>

<p>This is where it gets trick, though&mdash;we get to a road block with smiling and laughing, because we often don’t have a good idea of them, and there are some pretty powerful blocks stopping us from thinking about them widely.</p>

Let’s do a survey. COMEDY. Has anyone here ever smiled and laughed at jokes? Has anyone NOT laughed at jokes?



<p>Last chapter, we looked at elements that made humor <a href="../16chapter-a-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fit</a> situations.</p>
