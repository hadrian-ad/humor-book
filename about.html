       <p class="vig-indent">"The beautiful thing about this book is that it causes you to notice and appreciate an area of life that everyone agrees is important but receives very little formal investigation. I will be in the middle of a laugh with someone and cannot help but mentally dissect the situation with my new humor tools- which in turn makes me smile more."</p>

    <p>Hey! I'm Hadrian, the author of this book. I'm a humor theorist with a specific interest in <term>teaching</term> humor. To <em>everyone</em>.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Everyone should learn about humor!</h2>
    
    

    <p>When I tell people they should learn about humor, they sometimes take it personally. <callback>"I'm a pretty normal person!"</callback> they say, <callback>"I smile, I get jokes&mdash;so do I really need to learn more about humor?"</callback></p>
    
<p>And my reply is always: Yes! <sem>Everyone</sem> should learn more about humor. Humor is something with few borders and no skill ceiling. There's a lifetime dynamic going on&mdash;we're never done learning about it.</p>  

 
    <div class="about-box">
   
    <p>Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction. Instead, this book provides catalytic insight, helping us organize a lifetime of humor observations and experiences into a coherent system.</p>

        <p class="faq-question">Testimonial from Alice, music historian:</p>

           <p class="faq-question">Alex, consultant:</p>

  <h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Who is this course for?</h2>   
   
   <p>So is this course for you? Probably&mdash;this course has practical value to all kinds of people.  From experience, I can say this course helps:</p>
   
    
      <ul class="close-list">  
            <li><strong>architects</strong> and <strong>interior designers</strong> <callback><callback>(think about why some arrangements lead to more smiles over time than others)</callback></callback></li>
            <li><strong>facilitators</strong> and <strong>service workers</strong> <callback>(better handle conflict and create compromise)</callback></li>
            <li><strong>musicians</strong> and <strong>painters</strong> <callback>(make conscious creative choices leading to smiles)</callback></li>
            <li><strong>parents</strong> and  <strong>children</strong> <callback>(better understand each other)</callback></li>
            <li><strong>performers</strong> and <strong>public speakers</strong> <callback>(find new perspectives on their audience)</callback></li> 
            <li><strong>researchers</strong> and <strong>historians</strong> <callback>(use a coherent analytical model of humor)</callback></li>
            <li><strong>romantic partners</strong> and <strong>family members</strong> <callback>(more broadly generate laughter in people they care about)</callback></li>
            <li><strong>teachers</strong> and <strong>instructors</strong> <callback>(gain insights about their class and methods)</callback></li> 
            <li><strong>transplants</strong> and <strong>transfers</strong> <callback>(better form connections with strangers, neighbors, and coworkers)</callback></li> </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">
        (and so on)
    </p>
    
    <p>If you'd like to improve at any of the skills or outcomes above, then this course is for you.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, outside of any practical value, I think this book is also quite interesting! In many ways, humor is like the world's most interesting puzzle. It's fun to see how it can all be elegantly fit together and explained.</p>

    

    
 
      

      <div class="about-box">

<p>In this book, "humor" refers to the process through which smiles or laughs do or don't happen. This  means this isn't a book about "jokes," but about something much broader.</p> 

<p>For instance, we sometimes smile or laugh at:</p>
   
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>success</li>
        <li>failure</li>
        <li>hugs</li>
        <li>violence</li>
        <li>cute things</li>
        <li>gross things</li>
        <li>jokes</li>
        <li>compliments</li>
        <li>insults</li>
        <li>vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p>This book will explain the presence (or absence) of laughter in <sem>all</sem> cases. This is inclusive to jokes, but also treats them as incidental. The real prize is understanding smiling and laughter generally.</p>

    <div class="testimonial"><p class="faq-question">Testimonial from Chris, surgeon:</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent">“<i>The Humor Book</i> taught me how and why unconventional humor has a strong effect on reducing tension in critical situations. This has helped me in my practice and has made me a better surgeon instructor.”</p>
                
    <p class="faq-question">Natalie, women’s self-defense instructor:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“Humor is so important in my line of work, but it's something you have to be careful with. <i>The Humor Book</i> really lays out a usable guide for putting people at ease when you also want to avoid making people uncomfortable.”</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">This is a course on humor</h2> 

<p>This book isn't a series of amusing anecdotes&mdash;instead, it's a <sem-weak>course</sem-weak>. It <term>teaches</term> something: an <em>analytical model</em> of humor. We'll use this model to create methods of describing, generating, and observing humor.</p>

<p>We won't just <term>talk</term> about these things, but actually <em>learn</em> them too—by using thousands of vignettes, hundreds of graphs, dozens and dozens of case studies, and plenty of picture and video examples.</p> 
  
<p>We'll always focus on realistic people involved in realistic situations. This will keep our analytical model grounded to our actual experiences, and avoid getting weird or abstract. </p>
   
              <div class="about-box">

    <p>This is a brisk course of moderate length. It takes most readers in the ballpark of 10 hours to complete. Most readers find the time spent to be enjoyable, interesting, empowering, and personally relevant.</p>

    <p>Unlike some textbooks, which are designed to be modular, things in this book won't make much sense if we skip around. This book is meant to be read from beginning to end, just like a normal book.</p>

<p>Since humor is a coherent process, we can model it. We can use this model to describe and predict outcomes. This has transformational ramifications on how we see and use humor&mdash;leading to an improvement in our intuitive relation to humor.</p>
    
<p>The analytical model used in this book is just a means to an end. The end isn't to model humor&mdash;the end is to improve our day-to-day suite of humor skills. Any modeling is just a means to this end, and not so important in itself.</p>

        <p class="vig-indent">"I like <i>The Humor Book</i> because it's inherently human stuff. It's really the foundation, being sensitive to each other. The in-and-out, the flow of moments, and emotion and reaction. I feel it really captured it well."</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">The elephant in the room</h2>  

<p>One of the challenges to learning about humor is just how <sem>big</sem> it is. It's a bit like the story of the Blind Mice and the Elephant. The blind mice come across a mysterious object, and each touch it to see what it is:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>One blind mouse runs up the leg and says <callback>“it’s a tree trunk!”</callback></li> 
        <li>Another goes up the tail, and says <callback>“it’s a rope!”</callback></li> 
        <li>The last clambers around the ear and says <callback>“it’s a curtain!”</callback></li>
        
        </ul>

<p>This is like humor! At different times, to different people, humor is seen as:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>sometimes <sem>comedy</sem>, sometimes <sem>tragedy</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes <sem>frivolous</sem>, sometimes <sem>important</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes <sem>mean</sem>, sometimes <sem>kind</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>anxiety</sem>, sometimes to <sem>confidence</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>shame</sem>, sometimes to <sem>pride</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>failure</sem>, sometimes to <sem>success</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to jokes, sometimes to <sem>straight-talk</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes about <sem>lies</sem>, sometimes about <sem>truth</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes about <sem>randomness</sem>, and sometimes about <sem>insight</sem></li>
        </ul> 

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
<p>What sort of elephant is this? It's like having a jigsaw puzzle with no box art! It can feel bewildering to start out trying to put these all together.</p>
      
<p>But once we'll start, we'll see how all these pieces fit harmoniously together&mdash;and at the end, we'll be able to step back and see what this humor thing really looks like.</p>

      <div class="about-box">

    <p>Like any good puzzle, there are solutions that, while not obvious at the outset, are elegant when found. We'll arrive at this elegance by unfolding an explanation of humor piece-by-piece, chapter-by-chapter.</p>
       
    <p>Each chapter focuses one thing at a time. If something seems left out, it's probably because we'll be getting to it in a later chapter.
       </p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">The study of foundational skills</h2>
  
<p>The formal study of humor takes us to some pretty important fundamentals. That's because humor is involved in our ability to:</p>
  
  <ul class="close-list">
   <li>ask for and give aid</li>
   <li>adapt and be resilient</li>
   <li>convince others or effectively share viewpoints</li>
    <li>create things in ways that people (including ourselves) appreciate</li>
   <li>enjoy new and old things</li>
   <li>form acquaintances and grow closer to them</li>
    <li>interpret situations</li>
      <li>participate effectively in discussions and organizations</li>
    
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
<p>When we learn about humor, we learn about the process and methods in which all of these things happen&mdash;which in turn lets us do them better, and understand others better.</p> 

     
   <div class="about-box">
   
<p>There are many myths about humor—like that humor is abstract, unknowable, undefinable, unteachable, and so on. None of those are true. Usually, those statements describe the speaker more than they describe humor: <callback>"humor is unteachable (by me)."</callback>
</p>  

    
    </div>

<div class="testimonial">
    <p class="faq-question">Testimonial from Nick, musician:</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent">“<i>The Humor Book</i> really changed how I perceive music, since I see how music reaches positive humor outcomes. In the same way there’s dark humor, there’s dark music, and you can understand them similarly—why both can be enjoyable. And humor has a genre-bulldozing capability. I use this book's method of humor while writing music all the time."</p>
    
    <p class="faq-question">Kayde, student
       <p class="vig-indent"><book-title>The Humor Book</book-title> has given me a valuable lens through which to consider complex emotions like anger, joy, sadness, and&mdash;of course&mdash;humor. I have gained a better understanding of myself and the way I incorporate these emotions into my day-to-day interactions. After reading this book, I feel like I'm a better, more genuine communicator. </p>
</div>


<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">It's almost time to start</h2>

<p>I'm so excited you're about to start! It's my hope that re-encountering humor provides you with greater observational strength, social agency, wonder, and joy.</p>
