About
</h1>

<p>Hey! I'm Hadrian, the author of this book—I'm a humor ethnographer, theorist, and teacher. I love teaching humor, especially teaching it well!</p>

<p>I started <i>The Humor Book</i> after becoming dissatisfied about the quality and scope of existing guides to humor. They often took shortcuts, or didn't try to convey the full order and beauty that can be found to humor.</p>

<p>Which is a shame, because taking the time to present this order and beauty is wildly fun! It's like solving the world's best puzzle.</p> 

<p>We'll present and solve this puzzle by taking a grounded, practical approach. We'll find coherence to humor where we thought was randomness, and potency in ourselves where we thought were limitations.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">The elephant in the room</h2> 

<p>One of the challenges to learning about humor is just how <em>big</em> it is. It's a bit like the story of the Blind Mice and the Elephant. The blind mice come across a mysterious object, and each touch it to see what it is:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>One blind mouse runs up the leg and says “it’s a tree trunk!”</li> 
        <li>Another goes up the tail, and says “it’s a rope!”</li> 
        <li>The last clambers around the ear and says “it’s a curtain!”</li>
        
        </ul>

<p>This is like humor! At different times, we've probably come across humor as:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>sometimes comedy, sometimes tragedy</li>
        <li>sometimes frivolous, sometimes important</li>
        <li>sometimes mean, sometimes kind</li>
        <li>sometimes related to anxiety, sometimes to confidence</li>
        <li>sometimes related to shame, sometimes to pride</li>
        <li>sometimes related to failure, sometimes to success</li>
        <li>sometimes related to jokes, sometimes to straight-talk</li>
        <li>sometimes about lies, sometimes about truth</li>
        <li>sometimes about randomness, and sometimes about insight</li>
        </ul> 

<p><i>(and so on)</i></p>

<p>What sort of elephant is this? In some ways, it's like having a jigsaw puzzle in front of us, but no box. In this book, we'll be harmoniously arranging all the pieces together, letting us step back at the end and see the whole picture of the thing clearly.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Dispelling myths</h2>

<p>Along the way, we'll be freeing ourselves of some of the baggage we have about humor—a bunch of myths about humor that don't quite make sense when we lay them out starkly.</p>

<p>These myths are probably pretty familiar to us:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
       <li>I haven't been <em>taught</em> humor before. Therefore, humor <em>can't</em> be taught.</li>
        <li>Some people seem <em>naturally</em> funny. Therefore, <em>I</em> can't become funnier.</li>
     
        <li><em>Comedians</em> are funny. Therefore, comedians are the standard to which <em>everyone</em> should compare our humor skills to.</li>
        <li><em>Some</em> humor seems trivializing. Therefore, <em>all</em> humor is trivializing.</li>
        <li>We <em>sometimes</em> laugh at jokes. Therefore <em>everything</em> we laugh at is a joke.</li>
        <li>Funny <em>movies</em> sometimes have clever and witty scripts. Therefore, to make people laugh, <em>I</em> have to be clever and witty, like a script.
        </li>
        </ul>
    
<p><i>(and so on)</i></p>

<p>We'll take some time to iron out these informal logic fallacies—since they can cause us a lot of trouble otherwise! We'll untie these knots in our thinking, which will make our thinking  about humor much lighter, truer, and more powerful.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">This is a course on humor</h2> 

<p>Some humor books are fun because they skillfully tell anecdotes in an amusing style. This humor book is fun because it's a textbook. You know what I mean? </p>

alt="This graph previews the kind of analysis used in the rest of this book. It shows a a graph with two unlabled axes and two obscure measures, a title 'houseplant' and two markers: 'A. We give our houseplant a name' and 'B. We decide our houseplant is a reincarnated pine.'"

style="float: right; max-width: 15rem; margin-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem; border: black solid .1rem; padding:.4rem;">

<p>This book is a <em>course</em>: it teaches something—an analytical model of humor. Then it expands this model into an observational system to make sense of what's happening around us, and why.</p> 

<p>We'll use this model as a methodology for producing smiles and laughs—and then to draw inferences about what the absence or presence of laughter means about people, events, and places.</p>

<p>We'll go over all this in correct sequence and at a pace that genuinely allows us to learn these things. We'll finish the course fully comfortable with an elegant, organized, and productive worldview of humor.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">My fieldwork on humor</h2>


<p>Since high school, I've been taking notes on when people smiled and laughed. That didn't mean I was watching comedians and their audiences—after all, cashiers, teachers, tour guides, and so on <em>also</em> try to make people laugh too! These are the "real life" humorists that I found compelling.</p> 

<img src="images/about/smiling-intensities.png"
title="More preview examples"
alt="This figure previews the sort of analysis used in the rest of this book. The title is 'Smile,' and a picture of a man giving a very small, frustrated smile and a woman beaming. Beneath is a spectrum graph from less intense to more intense, with a note that smiles have a scale of intensity."
style="float: right; max-width: 20rem; margin-left: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem; border: solid .1rem;">

<p>I had my own experiences in these roles—I've been an after school teacher, barista, canvasser, cashier, dance teacher, event coordinator, facilitator, greeter, tutor, and so on.  In each of these positions, you sink or swim on your ability to generate smiles and laughs—and I costantly studied what worked, what didn't, when, and why all that might be.</p>

<p>So the observations that make the theory in this book are grounded in our day-to-day experiences—whether informal interactions between family and neighbors, applied humor from service workers or bus drivers—or just from the experiences of people looking out windows or playing games on their consoles. The normalcy of these observations keeps everything in this book grounded.</p>


<p>I call this "fieldwork" because a lot of studies of humor are more like "bookwork"—a structural analysis of comedies or satires, which isn't always grounded on the experiences of people. It also tends to leans toward <em>description</em> <callback>("the eight kinds of jokes")</callback> rather than <term>explanation</term> <callback>("the process of why we laugh at things in general")</callback> </p>

<p>In my experience, "explanation + fieldwork" fast tracks us to the central mysteries of humor, and move us face-to-face with the questions about humor that are hardest, most interesting, and most productive.
</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Research</h2>

<p>I did very little secondary research on humor for this book. It's a product of my own observation, thinking, and reading—outside of any dedicated literature review. In some ways, it's a fresh look at humor.</p>
  
<p>That means this book is <em>not</em> a good way to get acquainted with academic humor scholarship—whether psychological, computational, neurological, or so on. I don't see this as a failing in this book, as the goal here is practical clarity, not coordination or dialogue with an academic tradition.</p>

<p>The notable academic resource that I did use for this book was Warren Shibles' <i>Online Humor Reference Guide</i>—one of the weirdest books ever written. I'm grateful Shibles' book zapped my brain with its rays at an impressionable age, as it's set me down a path of humor-thinking I've been on for many years.</p> 

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Everyone should learn about humor</h2>

<p>You should learn more about humor. It doesn't matter if you're "good" or "bad" at humor—because <em>everyone</em> should know more about humor.</p>

        <p>It's hard to overstate how sparse formal understanding of humor is. Go into any crowd, and you'd probably find amateur-experts who'd happily stand up on a chair to talk and answer questions  about all kinds of amazing things: astrophysics, baking, large-scale vegetable farming, Tudor England, and so on.It's unlikely you'd find someone who'd be willing to stand up on a chair and explain humor, though.</p>

<p>In fact, almost uniquely among subjects today, humor is seen as unknowable, with even the most basic questions about humor are seen as unscalable mountains. (<callback>"Why is something funny?"</callback>) It's too bad!
<p>
  
<p>It leads to all kind of problems, too.  On a <em>collective</em> level, lack of analytical and applied humor methods leads groups unable to create joyful experiences—as anyone who has taken a joyless class or attended a joyless meeting can attest.
</p>

<p>On an <em>individual</em> level, a lack of analytical and applied humor methods lead to problems of action and decisions. Humor substantially contributes to our "aura of ability:" our collective ability to form acquaintances and grow closer to them—to make successful arguments—to ask for and give aid—to interpret situations—to create—to be resilient—and so on. There's no reason to limit our aura of ability.</p>

<p>So, in short, everyone should learn about humor. And the resources to do so should be clear, accessible, coherent, practical, straightforward, and so on—like what's attempted in this book.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">It's almost time to start</h2>

<p>Look, I'm so excited you're about to start! I've had a wonderful time putting this book together—doing so has certainly changed my own life. It's my hope that you'll find re-encountering humor provides you with long-lasting strength and wonder as well.</p>
