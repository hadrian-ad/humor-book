       <p class="vig-indent">"The beautiful thing about this book is that it causes you to notice and appreciate an area of life that everyone agrees is important but receives very little formal investigation. I will be in the middle of a laugh with someone and cannot help but mentally dissect the situation with my new humor tools- which in turn makes me smile more."</p>

About
</h1>

    <p>Hey! I'm Hadrian, the author of <book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title>. I'm a humor theorist with a specific interest in <term>teaching</term> humor. To <term2>everyone</term2>.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Everyone should learn about humor!</h2>
    
    

    <p>When I tell people they should learn about humor, they sometimes take it personally. <callback>"I'm a pretty normal person!"</callback> they say, <callback>"I smile, I get jokes&mdash;so do I really need to learn more about humor?"</callback></p>
    
<p>And my reply is always: <em>Yes!</em> <sem-weak>Everyone</sem-weak> should learn more about humor. Especially the <sem-weak>dynamics</sem-weak> of humor&mdash;where it comes from, where it goes, what it does, and how things change because of it.</p>

<p>While we all have an intuitive understanding of humor, not many of us are able to put this intuition into words. Beyond that, humor is something with few borders and no skill ceiling&mdash;there's a lifetime interaction going on, and we're never done learning about it.</p>  

 
<p>More interestingly, you'll find there are things about humor that you didn't know you didn't know&mdash;ideas of broad application and universal interest. We'll be discovering these things together throughout this book.</p>

 
    <div class="about-box">
   
    <p>Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction. Instead, this book provides catalytic insight, helping us organize a lifetime of humor observations and experiences into a coherent system.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Okay, "humor dynamics"&mdash;what's that again?</h2>  

<p>What's the difference between studying <term>garden flowers</term>, and studying <term>gardening</term>? Between studying the <term2>names of trees</term2> and studying <term2>ecology</term2>? Well, one's the study of something&mdash;the other is the study of the <em>system</em> that that "something" happens in.</p>
       
  <p>It's similar for <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>. It's the difference between studying "jokes" and studying the the deeper system that does or doesn't produce smiles or laughter&mdash;including aspects of duration and magnitude, and evolving relations to people around us.</p>
  
  <div class="consider">
        <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
      <p>Using a math analogy, going from <term>humor</term> to <term>humor dynamics</term> is a bit like moving from <term2>humor-arithmetic</term2> to <term2>humor-algebra</term2>. Like moving into algebra, a whole new world of understanding and application opens.</p>
          
     <p>That maybe sounds challenging&mdash;but it's actually only as challenging as the material makes it. This book is written so that it can be learned at a normal reading pace, like a normal book&mdash;without being made artificially challenging by the absence of examples or muddy language.</p> 
       
        </div>
   <div class="about-box">

<p><term>Humor</term> isn't "about" <term>jokes</term> for the same reason <term2>gardening</term2> isn't "about" <term2>carrots</term2>. Instead, like gardening, humor is a process that is inclusive to a variety of things, but not defined by them.</p> 

<p>Here, <vocab>humor</vocab> refers to the process to and function of smiles and laughs. This is something immensely broad&mdash;immensely broader than jokes&mdash;since we smile and laugh at all kinds of things, including when we:
  
   <ul class="close-list">
   <li>recieve good hugs</li>
   <li>hear slicing truths</li>
   <li>see ugly dogs</li> 
   <li>hear flattering compliments about us</li>
   <li>pick up funky vegetables in the store</li>
   <li>see our friend walking outside</li>
   <li>step into a beautiful room</li>
   </ul>
   
     <p class="and-so-on">and so on</p>
   
    <p>Complicating all this is that we sometimes <sem-weak>don't</sem-weak> smile or laugh at those things. Understanding the presence <em>or</em> absence of laughter in <em>all</em> these cases is the prize.</p> 
    
    <p>When we have this prize, we'll understand why we sometimes do and sometimes don't laugh at jokes&mdash;but that will be incidental to a much broader understanding of smiling and laughing in general.</p>

    <p class="faq-question">Testimonial from Nick, musician:</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent">“<i>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</i> really changed how I perceive music, since I see how music reaches positive humor outcomes. In the same way there’s dark humor, there’s dark music, and you can understand them similarly—why both can be enjoyable. And humor has a genre-bulldozing capability. I use this book's method of humor while writing music all the time."</p>

       <p class="vig-indent"><book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> has given me a valuable lens through which to consider complex emotions like anger, joy, sadness, and&mdash;of course&mdash;humor.

After reading this book, I feel like I'm a better, more genuine communicator. </p>

  <h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Who is this book for?</h2>   
   
 
  
    <p>This book is for people who have never done any formal study of humor. That's probably you! This book helps:</p>
   
     
   
   
    
      <ul class="close-list">  
            <li><strong>architects</strong>, <strong>civil engineers</strong>, <strong>interior designers</strong>, <strong>landscapers</strong> <callback>(think about why some arrangements lead to more smiles over time than others)</callback></li>

    <p class="and-so-on">
        (and so on)
    </p>
        
    <p>Of course, outside of any practical value, I think this book is also quite interesting! Humor is like the world's most interesting puzzle&mdash;it's fun to see how it all elegantly clicks together.</p>
    

   <div class="about-box">
  <p>There are many myths about humor—like that humor is abstract, unknowable, undefinable, unteachable, and so on. None of those are true. Usually, those statements describe the speaker more than they describe humor: <callback>"humor is unteachable (by me)."</callback>
</p>  

    <p>Myths around humor proliferate due to many disconnected conclusions. The reasoning here is often familiar when it's pointed out:</p>
    
    
<ul class="close-list">
   <li>"I can't teach others humor. Therefore humor can't be taught."
       </li>
       <li>    "Some people are naturally funny. Therefore I can't be funnier."</li>
    <li>"Comedians are funny. Therefore, comedians are the standard to which we should all compare our humor skills too." </li>
    <li>"Some humor is trivializing. Therefore, all humor is trivializing."</li>
    <li>"We sometimes laugh at jokes. Therefore everything we laugh at is a joke."</li>
    <li>"Funny movies sometimes have clever and witty scripts. Therefore, to make people laugh, I'd have to be clever and witty."</li>
    <li>"People laughed when I spoke up. Therefore I should feel shame." </li>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
     </ul>
      
    <p>When put starkly like this, it's often easy to see these conclusions don't follow. We'll be unlearning these incoherent statements in exchange for something elegant and explanative.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">You can think of this book as a course</h2> 


<p>People usually have expectations when I tell them about my "humor book." <callback>Surely,</callback> they think, <callback>this book will dip into amusing personal anecdotes, and digress into jokes or gags.</callback> How wrong they are!</p>
 
<p>Instead, this is written a goal-oriented book that <term>teaches</term> something: an <term2>analytical model</term2> of humor. We'll use this model to create methods of describing, generating, and observing humor.</p>

<p>We won't just <term>talk</term> about these things, but actually <term2>learn</term2> them too—by using thousands of vignettes, hundreds of graphs, dozens and dozens of case studies, and plenty of picture and video examples.</p> 
  
<p>We'll always focus on humor happening to people in real situations, over time&mdash;the dynamics of it all. This will keep our analytical model grounded to our actual experiences, and avoid getting weird or abstract.</p>

<p>It'll all be fun&mdash;not because it's full of well-styled anecdotes, but because it's fun to solve puzzles, improve skills, and see the world in refreshed ways are all fun.</p>
                
              <div class="about-box">

    <p>This is a brisk course of moderate length. It takes most readers in the ballpark of 10 hours to complete. Most readers find the time spent to be enjoyable, interesting, empowering, and personally relevant.</p>

<!--   
<div class="about-box"> 
       
<p>Since humor is a coherent process, we can model it. We can use this model to describe and predict outcomes. This has transformational ramifications on how we see and use humor&mdash;leading to an improvement in our intuitive relation to humor.</p>
    
<p>The analytical model used in this book is just a means to an end. The end isn't to model humor&mdash;the end is to improve our day-to-day suite of humor skills. Any modeling is just a means to this end, and not so important in itself.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">The elephant in the room</h2>  

<p>One of the challenges to learning about humor is just how <em>big</em> it is. It's a bit like the story of the Blind Mice and the Elephant. The blind mice come across a mysterious object, and each touch it to see what it is:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>One blind mouse runs up the leg and says <callback>“it’s a tree trunk!”</callback></li> 
        <li>Another goes up the tail, and says <callback>“it’s a rope!”</callback></li> 
        <li>The last clambers around the ear and says <callback>“it’s a curtain!”</callback></li>
        
        </ul>

<p>This is like humor! At different times, to different people, humor is seen as:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>sometimes <em>comedy</em>, sometimes <em>tragedy</em></li>
        <li>sometimes <em>frivolous</em>, sometimes <em>important</em></li>
        <li>sometimes <em>mean</em>, sometimes <em>kind</em></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <em>anxiety</em>, sometimes to <em>confidence</em></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <em>shame</em>, sometimes to <em>pride</em></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <em>failure</em>, sometimes to <em>success</em></li>
        <li>sometimes related to jokes, sometimes to <em>straight-talk</em></li>
        <li>sometimes about <em>lies</em>, sometimes about <em>truth</em></li>
        <li>sometimes about <em>randomness</em>, and sometimes about <em>insight</em></li>
        </ul> 

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
<p>What sort of elephant is this? It's like having a jigsaw puzzle with no box art! It can feel bewildering to start out trying to put these all together.</p>
      
<p>But once we'll start, we'll see how all these pieces fit harmoniously together&mdash;and at the end, we'll be able to step back and see what this humor thing really looks like.</p>

      <div class="about-box">

    <p>Like any good puzzle, there are solutions that, while not obvious at the outset, are elegant when found. We'll arrive at this elegance by unfolding an explanation of humor piece-by-piece, chapter-by-chapter.</p>
       
    <p>Each chapter focuses one thing at a time. If something seems left out, it's probably because we'll be getting to it in a later chapter.
       </p>
        
    </div>

<!--
<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">The study of capability</h2>
  
<p>Humor is worth studying&mdash;since it's involved in in virtually every critical skill in our lives, including how to:</p>
  
  <ul class="close-list">
   <li>ask for and give aid</li>
   <li>adapt and be resilient</li>
   <li>convince others, and effectively share viewpoints</li>
    <li>create things that people (including ourselves) appreciate</li>
   <li>enjoy new and old things</li>
   <li>form acquaintances, and grow closer to them</li>
    <li>interpret situations</li>
      <li>participate effectively in discussions and organizations</li>
    
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
<p>When we learn about humor, we learn about the dynamics in which all of these things do or don't happen&mdash;which we can spin methods and understanding out of. In practical ways, the study of humor dynamics is the study of how to be capable. Which is pretty neat!</p> 

   -->


<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">It's almost time to start</h2>

<p>I'm so excited you're about to start! It's my hope that re-encountering humor provides you with greater observational strength, social agency, wonder, and joy.</p>
