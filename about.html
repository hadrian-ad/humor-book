About
</h1>

    <p>Hey! I'm Hadrian, the author of this book. I'm a humor theorist with a specific interest in <term>teaching</term> humor. To <em>everyone</em>.</p>

    <h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Everyone should learn about humor!</h2>

    <p>Sometimes people are unsure if they need to learn about humor. They often say something like: <callback>"I'm a pretty normal person. I smile, I 'get' jokes. So do I really need to learn more about humor?"</callback></p>
    
<p>And my reply is always: <sem>Everyone</sem> should learn more about humor! There's a lifetime dynamic going on, centered on something with no skill ceiling and few borders.</p> 

<p>That's why the best and worst people at humor are both still learning about it—just like we are.</p>
 
    <div class="about-box">
   
    <p>Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction. Instead, this book provides catalytic insight to our experiences with humor, helping us organize a lifetime of observations into a coherent system.</p>
    </div>
    
    
<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">This is a course on humor</h2> 

<p>This book isn't a series of anecdotes told in an amusing style—it's a <term>course</term>. It <em>teaches</em> something: an analytical model of humor.</p>

<img 
class="center-if-screen-is-small"
  src="images/6c-images-topics/6-6-topics-track-mistakes-and-oks-not-humor/6-6-1-generating-humor-houseplant.png" 
title="Example of an image"
alt="This graph previews the kind of analysis used in the rest of this book. It shows a a graph with two unlabled axes and two obscure measures, a title 'houseplant' and two markers: 'A. We give our houseplant a name' and 'B. We decide our houseplant is a reincarnated pine.'"

style="max-width: 15rem;">

<p>We'll expand this model into a methodological and observational system to make sense of what's happening around us, and why.</p> 

<p>We won't just talk <term>about</term> these things, but actually <em>learn</em> them too—by using thousands of vignettes, hundreds of graphs, dozens and dozens of case studies, and plenty of picture and video examples.</p> 
    
      <div class="about-box">

    <p>This is a brisk course of moderate length. It takes most readers in the ballpark of 20 hours to complete. Most readers find the time spent to be enjoyable, interesting, empowering, and personally relevant.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike many textbooks, which are designed to be modular—skipped around as needed—this book is meant to be read from beginning to end, just like a normal book.</p>
    
    </div>

  

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">The elephant in the room</h2>  

<p>One of the challenges to learning about humor is just how <sem>big</sem> it is. It's a bit like the story of the Blind Mice and the Elephant. The blind mice come across a mysterious object, and each touch it to see what it is:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>One blind mouse runs up the leg and says <callback>“it’s a tree trunk!”</callback></li> 
        <li>Another goes up the tail, and says <callback>“it’s a rope!”</callback></li> 
        <li>The last clambers around the ear and says <callback>“it’s a curtain!”</callback></li>
        
        </ul>

<p>This is like humor! At different times, to different people, humor is seen as:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>sometimes <sem>comedy</sem>, sometimes <sem>tragedy</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes <sem>frivolous</sem>, sometimes <sem>important</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes <sem>mean</sem>, sometimes <sem>kind</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>anxiety</sem>, sometimes to <sem>confidence</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>shame</sem>, sometimes to <sem>pride</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>failure</sem>, sometimes to <sem>success</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to jokes, sometimes to <sem>straight-talk</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes about <sem>lies</sem>, sometimes about <sem>truth</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes about <sem>randomness</sem>, and sometimes about <sem>insight</sem></li>
        </ul> 

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
<p>What sort of elephant is this? It's like having a jigsaw puzzle with no box art! It can feel bewildering to start out trying to put these all together.</p>
      
<p>But once we'll start, we'll see how all these pieces fit harmoniously together&mdash;and at the end, we'll be able to step back and see what this humor thing really looks like.</p>

      <div class="about-box">

    <p>Like any good puzzle, there are solutions that, while not obvious at the outset, are elegant when found. We'll arrive at this elegance by unfolding an explanation of humor piece-by-piece, chapter-by-chapter.</p>
       
    <p>Each chapter focuses one thing at a time. If something seems left out, it's probably because we'll be getting to it in a later chapter.
       </p>
        
    </div>


<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">We'll gain a lot from this book</h2>
  
<p>I see humor as substantially and practically composing our <vocab>"aura of ability"</vocab>— in other words, our aggragate ability to:</p>
  
  <ul class="close-list">
   <li>ask for and give aid</li>
   <li>adapt and be resilient</li>
   <li>convince others or effectively share viewpoints</li>
    <li>create things in ways that people (including ourselves) appreciate</li>
   <li>enjoy new and old things</li>
   <li>form acquaintances and grow closer to them</li>
    <li>interpret situations</li>
      <li>participate effectively in discussions and organizations</li>
    
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
<p>When we learn about humor, we learn about the process and methods in which all these things happen!</p> 
  
<p>Our goal is to <term>understand</term> how this all works—and how to <em>do</em> it all, better than we do right now.</p>
   
   <div class="about-box">
   
    <p>In this book, "humor" refers to the process through which smiles or laughs do or don't happen.</p> 
    
    <p>We all have different levels of skill with this in different situations—but the more familiar we are with this process, the better our actions and decisions tend to be.
    </p>
    
    </div>




<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">It's almost time to start</h2>

<p>Look, I'm so excited you're about to start!  It's my hope that re-encountering humor—especially in this book's style and manner—provides you with greater observational strength, social agency, wonder, and joy.</p>
