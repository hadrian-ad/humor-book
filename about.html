    <h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">Everyone should learn about humor!</h2>

    <p>When I tell people they should learn about humor,  sometimes they take it as a slight. They often reply with something like: <callback>"I'm a pretty normal person! I smile, I get jokes. So do <sem>I</sem> really need to learn more about humor?"</callback></p>
    
<p>And my reply is always: yes! <sem>Everyone</sem> should learn more about humor. Humor is something with no skill ceiling and few borders. There's a dynamic of lifetime learning going on.</p> 

<p>That's why the best and worst people at humor are both still learning about it—just like we are.</p>
 
    <div class="about-box">
   
    <p>Even though this book starts "at the beginning," it's not remedial instruction. Instead, this book provides catalytic insight, helping us organize a lifetime of observations and experiences with humor into a coherent system.</p>

      <div class="about-box">

<p>In this book, "humor" refers to the process through which smiles or laughs do or don't happen. That means this isn't a book about "jokes," but about something much broader instead.</p> 

<p>For instance, we sometimes laugh at:</p>
   
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>success</li>
        <li>failure</li>
        <li>hugs</li>
        <li>violence</li>
        <li>cute things</li>
        <li>gross things</li>
        <li>jokes</li>
        <li>compliments</li>
        <li>vegetables</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p>This book will explain the presence or absence of laughter in <sem>all</sem> cases. This is inclusive to jokes, but also treats them as incidental. The real prize is understanding smiling and laughter generally.</p>

    <div class="testimonial"><p class="faq-question">Chris, surgeon:</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent">“<i>The Humor Book</i> taught me how and why unconventional humor has a strong effect on reducing tension in critical situations. This has helped me in my practice and has made me a better surgeon instructor.”</p>
                
    <p class="faq-question">Natalie, women’s self-defense instructor:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“Humor is so important in my line of work, but it's something you have to be careful with. <i>The Humor Book</i> really lays out a usable guide for putting people at ease when you also want to avoid making people uncomfortable.”</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">This is a course on humor</h2> 

<p>This book isn't a series of amusing anecdotes&mdash;instead, it's a <term>course</term>. It <em>teaches</em> something: an analytical model of humor.</p>

<img 
class="center-if-screen-is-small"
  src="images/6c-images-topics/6-6-topics-track-mistakes-and-oks-not-humor/6-6-1-generating-humor-houseplant.png" 
title="Example of an image"
alt="This graph previews the kind of analysis used in the rest of this book. It shows a a graph with two unlabled axes and two obscure measures, a title 'houseplant' and two markers: 'A. We give our houseplant a name' and 'B. We decide our houseplant is a reincarnated pine.'"

style="max-width: 15rem;">

<p>We'll expand this model into methodological and observational systems that will help us make sense of what's happening around us.</p> 

<p>We won't just talk <term>about</term> these things, but actually <em>learn</em> them too—by using thousands of vignettes, hundreds of graphs, dozens and dozens of case studies, and plenty of picture and video examples.</p> 
   
<div class="about-box"> 
       
       <p>The focus of this book will always be on realistic people involved in realistic situations. This will keep our analytical model grounded to our actual experiences.</p>
       
     <p>The analytical model in this book is used as a means to an end. The "end" is greater intuitive understanding of humor. Once we arrive there, the "means" doesn't matter so much.</p>

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">The elephant in the room</h2>  

<p>One of the challenges to learning about humor is just how <sem>big</sem> it is. It's a bit like the story of the Blind Mice and the Elephant. The blind mice come across a mysterious object, and each touch it to see what it is:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>One blind mouse runs up the leg and says <callback>“it’s a tree trunk!”</callback></li> 
        <li>Another goes up the tail, and says <callback>“it’s a rope!”</callback></li> 
        <li>The last clambers around the ear and says <callback>“it’s a curtain!”</callback></li>
        
        </ul>

<p>This is like humor! At different times, to different people, humor is seen as:</p>

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>sometimes <sem>comedy</sem>, sometimes <sem>tragedy</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes <sem>frivolous</sem>, sometimes <sem>important</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes <sem>mean</sem>, sometimes <sem>kind</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>anxiety</sem>, sometimes to <sem>confidence</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>shame</sem>, sometimes to <sem>pride</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to <sem>failure</sem>, sometimes to <sem>success</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes related to jokes, sometimes to <sem>straight-talk</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes about <sem>lies</sem>, sometimes about <sem>truth</sem></li>
        <li>sometimes about <sem>randomness</sem>, and sometimes about <sem>insight</sem></li>
        </ul> 

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
<p>What sort of elephant is this? It's like having a jigsaw puzzle with no box art! It can feel bewildering to start out trying to put these all together.</p>
      
<p>But once we'll start, we'll see how all these pieces fit harmoniously together&mdash;and at the end, we'll be able to step back and see what this humor thing really looks like.</p>

      <div class="about-box">

    <p>Like any good puzzle, there are solutions that, while not obvious at the outset, are elegant when found. We'll arrive at this elegance by unfolding an explanation of humor piece-by-piece, chapter-by-chapter.</p>
       
    <p>Each chapter focuses one thing at a time. If something seems left out, it's probably because we'll be getting to it in a later chapter.

<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">You'll gain a lot from this course</h2>
  
<p>Over the decade I've spent observing and thinking about humor, I've come to find it's hard to overstate how important an understanding of humor is. That's because our skill at humor substantially and practically makes up our aggragate ability to:</p>
  
  <ul class="close-list">
   <li>ask for and give aid</li>
   <li>adapt and be resilient</li>
   <li>convince others or effectively share viewpoints</li>
    <li>create things in ways that people (including ourselves) appreciate</li>
   <li>enjoy new and old things</li>
   <li>form acquaintances and grow closer to them</li>
    <li>interpret situations</li>
      <li>participate effectively in discussions and organizations</li>
    
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
<p>Since humor is tightly embedded into what makes all these things happen, learning about humor means learning about the process and methods in which all these things happen!</p> 
  
<p>Our goal is to understand how this all works—and how to <sem>do</sem> it all better than we do right now. In that sense, this is kind of an exciting book&mdash;it's about increasing a kind of aura of ability. </p>
   
   <div class="about-box">
   
<p>There are many myths about humor—like that humor is abstract, unknowable, undefinable, unteachable, and so on. None of those are true. Usually, those statements describe the speaker more than they describe humor: <callback>"humor is unteachable (by me)."</callback>
</p>  

<p>Since humor is a coherent process, we can model it. We can use this model to describe and predict outcomes. This has transformational ramifications on how we see and use humor&mdash;leading to an improvement in our intuitive relation to humor.</p>

    <p class="faq-question">Nick, musician:</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent">“<i>[The Humor Book]</i> really changed how I perceive music, since I see how music reaches positive humor outcomes. In the same way there’s dark humor, there’s dark music, and you can understand them similarly—why both can be enjoyable. And humor has a genre-bulldozing capability. I use [this book's] method of humor while writing music all the time."</p>
</div>


<h2 style="margin-bottom: .8rem; margin-top:1.8rem;">It's almost time to start</h2>

<p>Look, I'm so excited you're about to start!  It's my hope that re-encountering humor—especially in this book's style and manner—provides you with greater observational strength, social agency, wonder, and joy.</p>
     
           <div class="about-box">

    <p>This is a brisk course of moderate length. It takes most readers in the ballpark of 10 hours to complete. Most readers find the time spent to be enjoyable, interesting, empowering, and personally relevant.</p>
    
    <p>Unlike some textbooks, which are designed to be modular, things in this book won't make much sense if we skip around. This book is meant to be read from beginning to end, just like a normal book.</p>
