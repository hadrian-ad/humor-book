    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor is something we work toward</h1>
    
    
<p>It sometimes takes work to reach humor outcomes. This means that we don't always give up pushing toward a humor outcome if we don't reach it right away.</p> 

<p>We know this with polite refusals&mdash;if someone politely declines our offer of something to drink, we know that in some situations we push a little more:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Yasmin goes to the bathroom, leaving Trevor sitting awkwardly at the table with her mother and siblings. There’s an awkward pause.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Then Yasmin’s mother gets up.</narration> <speech>“Want some tea, pop, water?”</speech> <narration>she asks.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother tries to makes Trevor feel accepted)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*shakes head*</action> <speech>“No thank you, I’m good.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor resists this humor outcome with a polite refusal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> <speech>“No really, you’d make me feel happy to get you something. What would you like?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother applies more pressure)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Well, I guess I wouldn’t mind some soda.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor is pushed across the <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome> tripwire)</notes></p>

<p>While this is familiar for <term>polite</term> refusal, it's the exact same thing for <em>impolite</em> refusals too:</p>

<p>The difference between the polite and impolite refusals is smaller than it seems at first. They’re both part of positional evaluatory movement within a situation. One person is pushing the situation toward a humor outcome&mdash;another is trying to deflect from that outcome.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This partnered motion within a situation is how <sem>all</sem> humor happens, everywhere&mdash;not just for <humor-outcome>opening a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, but for <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>, and so on too.</p>
    
        <p class="considertext">More often than not, humor outcomes are reached after a give-and-take and push-and-pull&mdash;something that often involves resistance and tension before emotional outcomes are reached.</p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Declining.</headline> The offer of something to drink is just a means to Yasmin's mother's ultimate goal&mdash;which is for Trevor to feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This tells us how Trevor can decline the drink effectively. He'll have to pair his <callback>"no thanks"</callback> with <sem>humor tells</sem>, so Yasmin’s mother will see that he <humor-outcome>feels accepted</humor-outcome>. With her goal reached, she'll be happy to stop insisting on a drink&mdash;and Trevor has now effectively declined the drink without more offers of hospitality.</p>
       
<p>Otherwise, if Trevor just tries to explain why he doesn't want a drink <callback>("I'm not thirsty")</callback>, Yasmin's mother will just offer something else in pursuit of her goal of making Trevor feel <emotions>welcome</emotions>. </p>  
 
      
     <div class="consider">
         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             <p class="considertext">It's the same whether we're declining or <sem>accepting</sem> an offer. It's not enough for Trevor to simply <term>take</term> the drink without smiling&mdash;for the same reason he can't simply <em>refuse</em> the drink without smiling.</p>
             
            <p class="considertext">Whether accepting or declining an offer, we have to express humor tells when their goal is helping us reach a humor outcome. Otherwise, they see us as pointedly feeling <emotions>alienated</emotions>, <emotions>uncomfortable</emotions>, <emotions>unwelcome</emotions>, and so us.</p>
