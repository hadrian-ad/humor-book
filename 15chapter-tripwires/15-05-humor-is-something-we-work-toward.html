    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor is something we work toward</h1>
    
    
<p>It sometimes takes work to reach humor outcomes. And we don't have to give up pushing for a humor outcome if we don't reach it right away.</p> 

<p>We know this with polite refusals. If someone politely declines our offer of something to drink, that doesn't mean we always immediately stop.</p>
 
<p>Instead, we know that in some situations we sometimes push a little more:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Yasmin goes to the bathroom, leaving Trevor sitting awkwardly at the table with her mother and siblings. There’s an awkward pause.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Then Yasmin’s mother gets up.</narration> <speech>“Want some tea, pop, water?”</speech> <narration>she asks.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother tries to makes Trevor feel accepted)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*shakes head*</action> <speech>“No thank you, I’m good.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor resists this humor outcome with a polite refusal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> <speech>“No really, you’d make me feel happy to get you something. What would you like?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother applies more pressure)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Well, I guess I wouldn’t mind some soda.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor is pushed across the become accepted tripwire)</notes></p>

<p>While this is familiar for <term>polite</term> refusal, it's the exact same thing for <em>impolite</em> refusals too:</p>

<p>The difference between the polite and impolite refusals is smaller than it seems at first. They’re both part of positional movement within a situation&mdash;one person is pushing the situation toward a humor outcome and another trying to deflect from that outcome.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This partnered motion within a situation is how <sem>all</sem> humor happens, everywhere. There’s a give-and-take and a push-and-pull until outcomes are reached—a process that takes time and often involves resistance and tension before emotional outcomes are reached.</p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Declining.</headline> When Yasmin's mother offers Trevor a drink, she doesn't want him to take the drink—she instead wants Trevor to feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. The offer is just a means to this end.</p>
    
    <p>So if Trevor tries to decline by saying <callback>"I'm not thirsty,"</callback> Yasmin's mother will just offer something else <callback>(snack, cushion, or so on)</callback>—because she wants to reach her goal of Trevor expressing humor tells.</p> 
    
    <p>To decline a drink effectively, Trevor has to satisfy Yasmin's mother's goal by showing humor tells. He'll have to pair his <callback>"no thanks"</callback> with briefly <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on the people around him</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raising his speaking register</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>socially tightening</humor-tell>, and so on—which will let Yasmin’s mother will see that he <humor-outcome>feels accepted</humor-outcome>.</p> 
       
    <p>With her goal reached, she'll stop insisting on a drink—and Trevor has now effectively declined.</p> 
      
     <div class="consider">
         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             <p class="considertext">Notice that declining and <sem>accepting</sem> an offer have the same requirement. It's not enough to simply <term>take</term> a drink to <em>accept</em> it, for the same reason it's not enough to simply <term>refuse</term> it to <em>decline</em> it.</p>
             
<p class="considertext">When there's a goal of helping us reach a humor outcome, we have to express humor tells whether we accept or decline an offer.</p>
