    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor is something we work toward</h1>
    
    
<p>Humor outcomes are things we often have to work towards, over time. That means we don’t have to immediately give up pushing toward a humor outcome if we don’t get there right away.</p> 

 

<p>We know this with polite refusals. If we offer a guest something to drink, we know we don’t have to immediately stop if they politely decline. Instead, we know we sometimes push a little more:</p>

<p>While this is familiar for <term>polite</term> refusal, the exact same thing is true for <em>impolite</em> refusals too—we don’t need to take an impolite refusal at face value:</p>

<p>The difference between the polite and impolite refusals is smaller than it seems at first. They’re both part of positional movement within a situation. One person is pushing the situation toward a humor outcome and another trying to deflect from that outcome.</p> 


<p>This partnered motion within a situation is how <sem>all</sem> humor happens, everywhere. There’s a give-and-take and push-and-pull until outcomes are reached—a process that happens over time and that sometimes generate humor.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>No thanks.</headline> When Yasmin's mother offers Trevor a drink, her actual goal has nothing to do with the drink—she wants Trevor to feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. The offer is just a means to this end.</p>
    
    <p>If Trevor just says <callback>"I'm not thirsty,"</callback> Yasmin's mother will just offer something else—because she hasn't reached her goal of Trevor expressing humor tells.</p> 
    
    <p>If Trevor wants to decline a drink effectively, he has to do so with humor tells. If he says "no thanks" while briefly <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on the people around him</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raising his speaking register</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>socially tightening</humor-tell>, and so on—Yasmin’s mother will see that he <humor-outcome>feels accepted</humor-outcome>, which was her goal.</p> 
       
    <p>At that point, she'll stop insisting on a drink—and Trevor has now effectively declined.</p>
