    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor is something we work toward</h1>
    
    
<p>Humor outcomes are things we often have to work towards, over time. That means we don’t have to immediately give up pushing toward a humor outcome if we don’t get there right away.</p> 

 

<p>We know this with polite refusals. If we offer a guest something to drink, we know we don’t have to immediately stop if they politely decline. Instead, we know we sometimes push a little more:</p>

    <p><narration>Yasmin goes to the bathroom, leaving Trevor sitting awkwardly at the table with her mother and siblings. There’s an awkward pause.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Then Yasmin’s mother gets up.</narration> <speech>“Want some tea, pop, water?”</speech> <narration>she asks.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother tries to makes Trevor feel accepted)</notes></p>

<p>While this is familiar for polite refusal, the exact same thing is true for impolite refusals too—we don’t need to take an impolite refusal at face value:</p>

<p>The difference between the polite and impolite refusals is smaller than it seems at first. They’re both part of positional movement within a situation, with one person pushing the situation toward a humor outcome and another trying to deflect from that outcome.</p> 


<p>This sort of partnered motion within a situation is how all humor happens, everywhere. There’s a give-and-take and push-and-pull until outcomes are reached—a process that happens over time and that sometimes generate humor.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Declining.</headline> Yasmin’s mother has a goal—to help Trevor become accepted.  The drink was neither here nor there. To decline effectively, Trevor shouldn't act as if the drink is the goal ("I'm not thirsty"). Instead, he should decline while also showing humor tells.</p>
    
    
    <p>If Trevor briefly smiles, focuses on the people around him, raises his speaking register, loosens, socially tightens, and so on—Yasmin’s mother will see that he feels accepted, which was her goal. At that point, she'll stop insisting on a drink—and Trevor has now effectively declined.</p>
