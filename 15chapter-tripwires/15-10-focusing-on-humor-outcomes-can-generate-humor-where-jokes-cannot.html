    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Focusing on humor outcomes can generate humor where jokes can't</h1>
    

<p>When we want to generate humor in complex situations, we often have to use high-velocity comments. Rushing toward humor outcomes can get us past all the obstacles and complications that defend tripwires:</p>

<p>Jokes were easily deflected away from humor outcomes tripwires, since their low-velocity let them get muddled by the overall situation. The focus was more on creating a joke than actually pushing a situation toward humor outcomes.</p>

<p>By contrast, when people focused on reaching humor outcomes, this higher-velocity made them more successful in their circumstances.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">High-velocity comments are good at generating all kinds of emotions—which is why we can easily imagine alternatives where Justin was annoyed by Emma, Alina was dismissive of Hana, Zoe was embarrassed by Brad, and Amber was angry at Jennifer.</p>
    </div>
 

<p>The point here isn’t that rushing humor outcomes is a magic method—because it’s not! Generating humor in this way requires favorable conditions, judgment, luck, practice, skill, and so on. Often, the stakes are higher when we rush humor outcomes.</p>

 

<p>Instead, the point here is just to understand why and how humor happens, even in some initially confusing situations.</p>
