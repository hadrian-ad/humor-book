    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Focusing on humor outcomes can generate humor where jokes can't</h1>
    

<p>When we want to generate humor in complex situations, we often have to use high-velocity comments. Rushing toward humor outcomes can get us past all the obstacles and complications that defend tripwires:</p>

    <p>Justin: *hands back an essay* “Not up to your usual standards, Emma.”</p>
    
    <p>Emma: “Wow. And here I was thinking I had no standards!” (&larr;Emma tries to make a joke more than she tries to handle his criticism)</p>
    
    <p>Justin: (Not having it) “I’ll expect more from your final essay.” (&larr;Emma doesn’t reach any humor outcomes in Justin &larr;no humor)</p>

    <p>Emma: (irritated) (tired) “Yeah? Well I have a life.” (&larr;Emma tries to handle criticism)</p>
    
    <p>Justin: *laughs* “Fair enough. I’ll look forward to your final essay.” (&larr;Justin feels Emma has handled criticism, controlled a situation, been acceptably criticized, gained a new perspective&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

    <p>Hana is trying to use her ID card to get into the lab, but it’s not working. She stands there stupidly, swiping her card, until Alina comes to help her. “That’s so weird,” Hana says. “Usually I’m so much cooler and suaver!” (&larr;Hana tries to make a joke more than she tries to create rapport)</p>
    
    <p>“Hm.” Alina says, entering the lab. (&larr;Hana doesn’t reach any humor outcomes in Alina&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>
    
    Hana feels awkward. (&larr;Hana doesn’t reach any humor outcomes with herself&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)

It never opens for me.” (&larr;Hana tries to build rapport with Alina)</p>
    
    <p>“It’s been having troubles this week,” Alina says. “Call one of us down, we’ll help you with the door.” (&larr;Hana is unsure if she’s reached humor outcomes with Alina)</p>
    
    <p>Hana smiles gratefully. (&larr;Hana feels she has built rapport, become more accepted&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

        <p>Amber pulls up over the crosswalk, which always bothers Jennifer. “If you keep running over those zebras, we’ll… uh, be able to start our own glue factory!” Jennifer tries. (&larr;Jennifer tries to make a joke more than she tries to acceptably criticize Amber)</p>
        
        <p>“What?” Amber says, peeved. (&larr;Jennifer fails to reach any humor outcomes with Amber&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>

        <p>Amber pulls up over the crosswalk, which always bothers Jennifer. “Stop pulling up to the crosswalk!” she finally says. “So rude to the pedestrians!” (&larr;Jennifer tries to acceptably criticize Amber)</p>
        
        <p>Amber laughs. “Okay. Sure.” (&larr;Amber feels she was acceptably criticized, and that Jennifer supported her argument well&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

<p>Jokes were easily deflected away from humor outcomes tripwires, since their low-velocity let them get muddled by the overall situation. The focus was more on creating a joke than actually pushing a situation toward humor outcomes.</p>

<p>By contrast, when people focused on reaching humor outcomes, this higher-velocity made them more successful in their circumstances.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">High-velocity comments are good at generating all kinds of emotions—which is why we can easily imagine alternatives where Justin was annoyed by Emma, Alina was dismissive of Hana, Zoe was embarrassed by Brad, and Amber was angry at Jennifer.</p>
    </div>
 

<p>The point here isn’t that rushing humor outcomes is a magic method—because it’s not! Generating humor in this way requires favorable conditions, judgment, luck, practice, skill, and so on. Often, the stakes are higher when we rush humor outcomes.</p>

 

<p>Instead, the point here is just to understand why and how humor happens, even in some initially confusing situations.</p>
