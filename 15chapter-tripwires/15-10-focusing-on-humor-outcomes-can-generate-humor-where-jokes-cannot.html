    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Focusing on humor outcomes can generate humor where jokes can't</h1>
    

<p>When we want to generate humor in complex situations, we often have no other option but to use high-velocity comments.</p>

<p>That's because low-velocity comments can be mired by other priorities within complicated emotional situations. It's only high-velocity actions or comments that can break through these obstacles and rush the situation into humor outcomes:

<p>Jokes were easily deflected away from humor outcomes tripwires, since their low-velocity either allowed them to be easily countered, or else never got traction in the overall situation.</p>

<p>By contrast, when people focused on reaching humor outcomes, this higher-velocity alternative made them successful in their circumstances.</p>

<p>Generating humor in this way requires favorable conditions, judgment, luck, practice, skill, and so on. Often, the stakes are higher when we rush humor outcomes. So the point here isn’t that rushing humor outcomes is a magic method—because it’s not! </p>

<p>Instead, the point here is just to understand why and how humor happens, even in some initially confusing situations.</p>
