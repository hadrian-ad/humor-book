<p>If Heather always reacts straightforwardly, Xiaowei knows he can disrupt her whenever he wants&mdash;and Heather feels vulnerable in conversation with him.</p>
 
 <div class="for-instance">
     <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p> 
     
      <p class="for-instance-text">
          When Heather recieves a sharp comment <callback>("when my shit turns blue")</callback>, her first thought is to react straightforwardly to it. <callback>(“He’s being rude so I should be offended.")</callback></p>
          
          <p class="for-instance-text">This kind of <callback>"if A then B has to follow"</callback> isn't always helpful&mdash;since Heather can actually react in any number of ways.</p> 
          
          <p class="for-instance-text">If she holds too tightly to <callback>"If A then B has to follow,"</callback> she'll be predictably reactive. This will cede her situational influence to whoever she's talking to, and narrow the range of possible outcomes for no reason.</p>

<p>Since Heather and Xiaowei continuously co-create emotional situations <sem-weak>together</sem-weak>, Heather has influence in what happens:</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>Above, Heather prevents Xiaowei from feeling humor. She does this by defending the tripwires he was pushing toward.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t to say this is the best thing for Heather to do&mdash;or that preventing someone’s humor is good or bad. Instead, we’re just looking at how Heather has influence in whether Xiaowei feels humor or not—she’s an active participant in the emotional situation.</p> 
    </div>

<p>She can also try <sem>switching</sem> active topics&mdash;generating humor in Xiaowei on a topic of her choosing. This briefly disorients Xiaowei’s commitment to <humor-outcome>control the situation (by stonewalling his mother)</humor-outcome>:</p>

    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“Can’t wait to tell you about the carpet shop!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Heather preempts Xiaowei from feeling he <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>handled a complaint</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>

<p>When Heather switches topic, it changes how we’d characterize Xiaowei’s humor:</p>

 <ul class="close-list">
     <li>When Xiaowei feels humor on the topic ‘ending conversation,’ he feels he’s <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>.</li> 
     
     <li>When Xiaowei feels humor on the topic ‘gaming successes,’ he feels Heather <humor-outcome>symbolized closed ties</humor-outcome> and that <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>Heather</outcome-contrast> controlled the situation</humor-outcome>.</li>
 </ul>


<p>Since no one has unilateral control over emotional outcomes, someone saying something "rude" doesn't predetermine outcomes&mdash;the other person's reaction co-creates the emotional situation.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Timing.</headline> It sometimes takes us a while to reach humor outcome tripwires. For instance, at <term>first</term> we might be <term>angry</term>—and it’s not until <em>later</em> that we get a different perspective and feel <em>humor</em>:</p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
            <p><narration>Days after Xiaowei brushes off Heather, infuriating her, Heather spends the evening with Justin.</narration></p>
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>"Did you ever bring up my brother’s carpet shop to Xiaowei?"</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“I almost got there!”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Heather <humor-outcome>gains a perspective</humor-outcome> that Xiaowei <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>

    <p>Heather at least temporarily shifts perspective: instead of feeling Xiaowei <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>lost control</outcome-contrast> of a situation</humor-outcome>, she sees him as having <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>—and so felt humor. But this happened days after the conversation!</p>
