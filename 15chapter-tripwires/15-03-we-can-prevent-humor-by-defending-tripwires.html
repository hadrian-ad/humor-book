    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">2. Humor is an emotion</h1>
    
    
    
<p>If Heather feels she has to react straightforwardly to Xiaowei’s comment <callback>(“he’s being rude so I should act as if he were rude”)</callback>, she can feel helpless in the emotional situation, which closes other possible outcomes.</p>

 

<p>If she instead sees herself and Xiaowei as continuous co-creators of the emotional situation, she’ll see herself as being influential in what outcome actually happens:</p>

    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <action>*keeps playing*</action> <speech>“Sure. I guess. Maybe not.”</speech></p> 
    
    </div>
    
    <p>Above, Heather prevents Xiaowei from feeling humor. She does this by defending the tripwires he was pushing toward.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t to say this is the best thing for Heather to do, or that preventing someone’s humor is good or bad. Instead, we’re just looking at how Heather has influence in whether Xiaowei feels humor or not—she’s an active participant in the emotional situation.</p> 
    </div>

<p>She can also try switching active topics. This can let her generate humor in Xiaowei on a topic of her choosing. This briefly disorients Xiaowei’s commitment to <humor-outcome>control the situation</humor-outcome>:</p>

    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*hands on hips*</action> <speech>“Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”</speech></p>

    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“Can’t wait to tell you about the carpet shop!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Heather preempts Xiaowei from feeling he controlled the situation and handled a complaint)</notes></p>

<p>When Heather switches topic, it changes how we’d characterize Xiaowei’s humor. When he feels humor on the topic ‘ending conversation,’ he feels he’s <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>. But if he feels humor on the topic ‘gaming successes,’ he feels Heather <humor-outcome>symbolized closed ties</humor-outcome> or Heather <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>.</p>


<p>No single person has complete, unilateral control over emotional outcomes, since they're always co-created between people. This is why someone saying something "rude" doesn't predetermine outcomes.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Timing.</headline> It sometimes takes us a while to reach humor outcome tripwires. For instance, we might be angry at first—and it’s not until private reflection that we get a different perspective:</p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>"Did you ever bring up my brother’s carpet shop to Xiaowei?"</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“I almost got there!”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> (&larr;when looking back, Heather feels Xiaowei controlled a situation)</p>
        
        </div> 
    
             <img src=../images/15c-images-humor-tripwires/15-3-we-can-prevent-humor-by-defending-tripwires/15-03-0-box-time.png

        title="";
        style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
         >
    
    
    <p>Heather at least temporarily shifts from feeling she and Xiaowei lost control of a situation into feeling he <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>—and so felt humor. But this happened days after the conversation!</p>
