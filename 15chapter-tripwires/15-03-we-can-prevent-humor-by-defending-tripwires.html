    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can defend tripwires to prevent humor</h1>
    
    
    
<p>If we think we're supposed to react straightforwardly to things, we'll close the range of possible outcomes. And this will make us feel vulnerable in emotional situations.</p>
 
 For instance: 

  When Heather recieves a sharp comment <callback>("when my shit turns blue")</callback>, she her first thought is to react straightforwardly to it. <callback>(“He’s being rude so I should be offended.")</callback>
  
<p>When Heather does this consistently, Xiaowei learns he can disrupt her whenever he wants&mdash;and Heather feels this vulnerability in conversation with him.</p>

<p>But when we think of everyone as continuous co-creators of the emotional situation, we'll see that we have shared influence in what happens&mdash;which gives us lattitude for a range of responses:</p>

    <p>Above, Heather prevents Xiaowei from feeling humor. She does this by <sem>defending</sem> the tripwires he was pushing toward.</p>

    <p class="considertext">This isn’t to say this is the best thing for Heather to do, or that preventing someone’s humor is good or bad. Instead, we’re just looking at how Heather has influence in whether Xiaowei feels humor or not—she’s an active participant in the emotional situation.</p> 
    </div>

<p>She can also try <sem>switching</sem> active topics&mdash;generating humor in Xiaowei on a topic of her choosing. This briefly disorients Xiaowei’s commitment to <humor-outcome>control the situation</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>When Heather switches topic, it changes how we’d characterize Xiaowei’s humor. When he feels humor on the topic ‘ending conversation,’ he feels he’s <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>. But if he feels humor on the topic ‘gaming successes,’ he feels Heather <humor-outcome>symbolized closed ties</humor-outcome> or that <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>Heather</outcome-contrast> controlled the situation</humor-outcome>.</p>


<p>No single person has complete, unilateral control over emotional outcomes, since emotional outcomes are always co-created between people. This is why someone saying something "rude" doesn't predetermine outcomes.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Timing.</headline> It sometimes takes us a while to reach humor outcome tripwires. For instance, at first we might be <term>angry</term>—and it’s not until private reflection that we get a different perspective and feel <em>humor</em>:</p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
            <p><narration>Days after Xiaowei brushes off Heather, infuriating her, Heather spends the evening with Justin.</narration></p>
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>"Did you ever bring up my brother’s carpet shop to Xiaowei?"</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“I almost got there!”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;when looking back, Heather feels Xiaowei controlled a situation)</notes></p>

    <p>Heather at least temporarily shifts perspective. Instead of feeling Xiaowei <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>lost</outcome-contrast> control of a situation</humor-outcome>, she sees how he <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>—and so felt humor. But this happened days after the conversation!</p>
