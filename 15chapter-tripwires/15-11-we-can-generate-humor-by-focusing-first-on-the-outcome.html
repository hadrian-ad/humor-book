    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can generate humor by focusing first on the outcome</h1>

    
<p>Loosely, there are two approaches to thinking about accomplishing things with humor:</p>

<ul>
   <li>An <vocab>emotion-first</vocab> method, which treats a <term>humor outcome</term> as a consequence of <em>humor</em>. <callback>("If they laugh, they'll reach a humor outcome.")</callback></li>
    <li>An <vocab>outcome-first</vocab> method, which treats <term>humor</term> as a consequence of a <em>humor outcome</em>. <callback>("If they reach a humor outcome, they'll laugh")</callback></li>
    </ul>

<p>These two approaches let us talk about the same thing in different ways:</p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
   <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> <callback>“If he laughs, I’ll have handled his criticism”</callback></li>
    
    <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> <callback>“If I handle his criticism, he’ll laugh”</callback></li>
    </ul>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> <callback>“If I feel humor, I’ll have dealt with a taboo topic”</callback></li>
    
    <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> <callback>“If I deal with a taboo topic, I’ll feel humor”</callback></li>
    </ul>

    <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">    
            
    <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> <callback>“If they feel humor, I’ll have eased their tensions.”</callback></li>
        
    <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> <callback>“If they ease their tensions, they’ll feel humor.”</callback></li> 
                </ul>
                
<p>Essentially, this is like solving X = Y. If we think we can <term>only</term> solve for X, we'll limit our approach. But if we realize we can <em>also</em> solve for Y, 
we'll have much greater flexibility in different situations.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're welcoming new employees we'll want there to be at least some humor. But if we’re stuck on emotion-first methods <callback>("how can I make them laugh?")</callback>, we may only think about jokes, funny voices, goofy icebreakers, and so on. <callback>(“If we all laugh, we’ll ease tension.”)</callback></p> 
    
        <p class="for-instance-text">But we can use an outcome-first method to think more broadly. When we focus on a humor outcome <callback>(“how can I ease tension?”)</callback>, we think of a different set of things—acts of inclusion, compliments, displays of equality, gifts, hospitality, tours, warm welcomes, and so on—all of which can generate humor when done well.</p>

    Case studies

<div class="content-example">

  <p>We can put everything together to look at some case studies using signage. We'll see how humor outcomes can be used as tools to interpret situations and design for effectiveness.</p> 
   
  <p>To start, we notice that what makes signs effective is <term>humor</term>&mdash;and what makes signs ineffective is the <em>lack</em> of humor. At first, this can seem odd&mdash;we don't usually think about humor as making signs function.</p> 
  
 <p>However, this makesThis makes more sense when we think about our emotional zones:</p>

 <ul class="close-list">
      
         <li>We'll be confused, disproportionately cautious, upset, and so on by signs that make us feel <sem>mistake-predominant emotions</sem>—like how a sign that says "this public transit system may kill you!" would create unease at odds with its purpose.</li>
      
    <li>We'll reach humor outcomes if the signs make us feel <sem>humor</sem>. If the humor is on relevant topics, we'll feel the sign has <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>leveled criticism acceptably</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>shared perspectives</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
    
      <li>We'll ignore signs that make us feel <sem>OK-predominant emotions</sem>—like a generic caution sign we've seen thousands of times.</li> 
    
        </ul> 
  
<p>This means we'd want to balance mistakes and OKs in the people we'd want the sign to used by. How do we go about doing this? We'll look at case studies at both an outcome-first method of humor and an emotion-first method of humor.</p>

<p>The library recognize an unusual risk, so they decide to put up warning signs. However, due to the novelty of the risk, they decide they need to not just signal a generic "warning" but to actually <humor-outcome>support the argument (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. Recognizing that this is a humor outcome, the library realizes this becomes in part a humor task.</p> 

<p>How can the sign-makers go about generating humor? They could try to generate humor by doing something "funny." But they decided to instead focus on reaching the humor outcome directly—an <sem>outcome-first method</sem>.</p>
 
 <p>
Once they decide this, they don't need to think about "humor" at all&mdash;no need for jokes, comics, cartoon characters, self-reference, or other things typecast as "funny." They instead just focus all their efforts on <humor-outcome>supporting an argument.</humor-outcome> <callback>("If our argument is supported, they'll feel humor.")</callback>
 </p> 

<p>This means they prioritized presenting a compelling argument—they prioritized <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>. They laid out the reasons for caution, with an implied negative consequences if caution isn't exercised.</p>
 
<p>This has to balance mistakes and OKs. They callibrate these by considering their audience <callback>(literate parents)</callback> and thinking about its location <callback>(a library)</callback>. This lets them think about balancing mistakes and OKs in this context for these people, without risking that they'd fall into mistake-predominance or OK-predominance.</p>

<p>Nothing about this sign on the surface is funny, frivolous, insincere, sarcastic, or other things we may associate with comedy. But we saw in a previous example that Justin laughed at this sign—and his humor shows he reaches humor outcome tripwires.</p> 
    
    <p>Among other things, he thought the sign <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>&mdash;and his humor showed the sign was implemented correctly.</p>

    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>The transit company above wanted to <humor-outcome>support an argument  (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. To reach this humor outcome, they could have focused making a strong argument for caution <callback>(outcome-first: "if they feel our argument is supported, they'll feel humor")</callback>. But instead, they used a cartoony allegory to try to balance mistakes and OK <callback>(emotion-first: "if they feel humor, they'll feel our argument is supported")</callback>.</p>

<p>How did they decide between these methods? They thought about their target audience and how people would use their sign. They knew people may not spend much time looking at this sign, so they wanted to avoid long text or complicated visuals to support their arrgument. They also knew that not all the people they're trying to reach can read Turkish. So they decide on something visual.</p>

<p>So they decide an emotion-first method would best help them accomplish their task.</p>

<p>That means they focus first on balancing mistakes and OKs, and don't bother thinking about this in terms of <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>. So they think about how to deviate from someone's expectations&mdash;which they did by showing a bumbling figure carelessly skipping toward an ambushing Death.</p> 

<p>To balance out this mistake, they raise our OK by using an abstract and cartoonish style, and have the negative consequences be implied in the future. Our disassociation from the character and outcome lets us feel secure from negative personal consequences.</p>  

<p>The designers have to callibrate mistakes and OKs based on their audience. For instance, they can make the sign more or less like other warning signs to modulate the mistake&mdash;or make the drawing more or less realistic to modulate the OK. If the audience feels humor, they'll have <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome> and accomplished their goal.</p>

   Case study #3 (Working backword)
    
    </button>
        
<div class="content-example">                         
<p>Task: A church wants to prevent cars cutting through their parking lot. So they decide to make a sign to that effect. How do they go about making an effective sign?</p>
            
<p>They start by thinking about they want their sign to achieve: they want to <humor-outcome>control/influence situations (by making drivers voluntarily stop cutting through)</humor-outcome>. In other words, the church wants their sign to generate humor.</p>

<p>They think about the most obvious sign they could think of <callback>("no cutting through")</callback>&mdash;and decide this probably wouldn't generate humor in a way that influenced a situation as much as they would like.</p> 

<p>So they think about using an outcome-first method of design. They brainstorm some of the most obvious ways to rush humor outcome tripwires&mdash;like by listing stats to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>; using a graphic of elderly or young church goers to <humor-outcome>share a perspective</humor-outcome>; bonding with readers by <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome><callback> ("hey, good neighbor!—please don't cut through")</callback>; and so on.</p> 

<p>They evaluate these approaches for suitability. Most of them have drawbacks: graphics are expensive to commission; stats take space to present effectively, especially to people in cars who are distant and fast-moving; elaborate sentences take time to read, which drivers don't always have; and so on.</p>

<p>So they set aside outcome-first methods, and brainstorm emotion-first methods. They take their standard idea <callback>("no cutting through")</callback> and think about how they could make it deviate from people's expectations. They think about adding colors, using an unusual shape or size, choosing an odd font, using odd phrasing; using slang; reverse psychology; and so on.</p>

<p>None of these add velocity toward a <humor-outcome>control a situation tripwire</humor-outcome>. <callback>(Not outcome-first)</callback> But they <sem>do</sem> have the advantage of meshing with the constraints of their sign.</p>

<p>So they pick a few of the emotion-first ideas that they thought were thematically relevant to the church, using gothic script and archaic English to make a sign that says "Thou Shalt Not Cut Through." They make an emotional forecast that many drivers would have balanced mistakes and OKs at this sign, which would reduce the rate of cutting through by <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>.

<p>Notice that these two methods "outcome-first" and "emotion-first" aren't actually distinct categories—they're just practical ways of relating ourselves to the same process, and gaining different perspectives on how and why we generate humor.</p>

   Supplemental (Mechanism of influence)
    
    </button>
        
<div class="content-example">  
             
<p>One humor outcome is <humor-outcome>influence/control a situation</humor-outcome>. Of course, there are other ways we can control a situation&mdash;someone can threaten us with a lawsuit, call the police, or draw a knife. They may use these to influence/control a situation without humor.</p> 

<p>We can be more specific about humor outcomes. In this book, humor is the mechanism of <vocab>concordant</vocab> influence. "Concord" is a useful word that implies mutual agreement of purpose. It etymologically means "hearts (acting) together."</p>

<p>So if someone wants us to move our bags, they can try to coerce us&mdash;but if they're successful, it won't be <term>concordant</term> influence. It'll be <em>coercive</em> influence. On the other hand, if they smile as they ask and we smile in return we may move our bags through mutual alignment&mdash;in which case, the emotion of humor was the mechanism of concordant influence.</p>

 <p>We experience coercive influence all the time <callback>(mistake-predomiant influence)</callback>&mdash;which is why we obey petty police officers; no entry signs; foolish professors; confusing tax forms; grasping managers; domineering parents; and so on. These <sem>compel</sem> compliance through non-concordant means. </p>

<p>We also experience inertial or status quo influence all the time <callback>(OK-predominant influence)</callback>&mdash;which by being OK-predominant is often invisible. This is like when we take a familiar route over another; wear one style of clothing and not another; use one calendar system and not another; and so on.</p> 
   
<p>In this book, humor outcomes are outcomes achieved through concord. It's the way we <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective (through concord)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>reveal a personal review (through concord)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>acceptably critizize (through concord)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<p>In that sense, humor is the line between influence by tradition and coercion, which makes humor the concordant method of change: the mechanism of influence, of perspective-giving, rapport-creating, tie-making, and so on. There is no other concordant way to do this other than humor.</p> 
 
  <div class="for-instance-text"> 
      <p class="for-instance">For instance: </p>
        
      <p class="for-instance-text">We can open a topic of conversation many ways. We can badger someone until they talk about it. We can bring it up suddenly in a situation where they can't avoid it. In these cases they'd be irritated and reluctant to talk about it <callback>(coercive, or unilateral, influence)</callback>.</p> 
        
       <p class="for-instance-text">On the other hand, we can also open a topic of conversation where they show humor tells (<humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, and so on) and talk openly about it. In this case, we'll have a more mutual conversation <callback>(concordant, or multilateral, influence)</callback>. 
           </p>  
      <p class="for-instance-text">That's because humor is the mechanism of concordant influence.</p>
  </div> 
   
 <p>This is a core idea to this book&mdash;and is often an unfamiliar one to handle. It also has some odd implications that we'll be carefully following as we go through this book. Overall, it's something we'll be making sense of piece-by-piece as we progress.</p>

<p>Sometimes these observations go against how we think interactions are supposed to work, and because of this they can seem confusing or mysterious. But once we know how to think about it, the humor in these situations isn’t confusing or mysterious.</p>

<p>The people in these examples are just using outcome-first methods of generating humor. They’re rushing humor outcome tripwires like <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, or so on—and the high velocity rushes the comments across tripwires before anyone can deflect them.</p> 

<p>This isn't random, unknowable, or at all outside any normal pattern of humor—it doesn't break any laws of social physics.</p>

<p>At first, these sharp, outcome-first humor attempts might seem like gambles—like someone is rolling the dice on whether someone feels anger or humor. But there’s actually no gambling in the examples above, since everyone had high confidence that the person they were talking to would laugh and not be offended.</p> 

<p>We already know what this feels like! We do this all the time, when we <sem>know</sem> whether or not someone will feel humor before we make a comment:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*putting on tie*</action> <action>*walking into bedroom*</action> <speech>“And how are you today, my little crab cake?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam knows Jennifer will laugh at this)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“That’s the worst one yet!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    </div>
    
<p>When Sam uses a joke nickname with Jennifer, he isn't sweating and crossing his fingers. <callback>("Oh god oh god I hope this lands")</callback> He already knows Jennifer will laugh!</p> 

<p>If he thought she’d be annoyed, he wouldn’t have said it—and even if she’s unexpectedly out of sorts, he’s not worried about his ability to adapt to it.</p> 

<p>This is the same feeling everyone in our examples had when they made their sharp comments. Each person had practiced a similar kind of comment with many different kinds of people in similar situations over and over:</p>

<ul style="close-list">
   <li>Elias often flirts with strangers</li>
    <li>Amber often comments on physical appearances of strangers</li>
    <li>Emma is often direct with people</li>
    <li>the waiter deals with dozens of customers each day</li>
    <li>Timothy delivers bad news to patients all the time</li>
    <li>the tutor works with many students each day</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>This constant practice gave them the skill to have a pretty good idea of the emotional outcome in advance. In the same way Sam and Jennifer's constant interaction lets them have high confidence in outcomes, the tutor's constant interaction with clients lets them have high confidence in outcomes.</p>

<p>These comments only <sem>appear</sem> to be acts of courageous spontaneity if we see them as an isolated, single instance—instead of part of a practiced skill.</p>

<p>How does the tutor knows in advance which student will respond in which way? For instance, how does the tutor know saying <callback>"this is terrible"</callback> would make Zoe laugh, but not Emma?</p>

<p>Partially, the tutor judges how disposed a client seems to defend which tripwires. This lets the tutor decide which topics to try to generate humor on, and how. With enough clients and clients, the tutor develops an intuitive skill at this.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If the student is arrogant, controlling, demanding, defensive, proud, and so on, they may resist being rushed across <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome> tripwire. In this case, the focus may first be on <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">By contrast, if the student seems to be looking for advice, nervous, unsure of what to do, uncertain of the quality of their work, willing to put in more work, and so on—then the tutor may judge that they can rush them across <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome> tripwires, and in a way the student will appreciate and find productive and positive.</p> </div>

<p>It’s the same for the other examples. Elias, Emma, Amber, Timothy, and the waiter knew in advance how the specific people they were talking too would react. They knew what the likely outcome would be, and were confident they could handle outlier outcomes.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes this outcome-first humor confuses us because of its apparent negativity, like when Amber criticized someone. <callback>(“You look terrible.”)</callback> But our confusion is caused by an incorrect assumption: that we only feel humor at “good” things, and that we shouldn't feel humor at “bad” things.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">But as we’ve seen, humor doesn’t distinguish between “good” mistakes and “bad” mistakes. All that matters is how much something deviates from our expectations, and whether that’s matched by our sense of security from negative personal consequences.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">If the server feels secure from negative personal consequences, we don’t need to think about ideas like “good” or “bad.” Questions like <callback>“was it good or bad for Amber to make that comment?”</callback> or <callback>"is it good or bad to be told we look terrible?"</callback> aren't relevant to thinking about why someone does or doesn't feel humor.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>We can probably find places in our own lives where others would view our own humor skills as miraculous—we just don’t notice this because these skills seem so utterly normal to us. This might be how we interact with new coworkers, freshmen teammates, young children, patients, long-standing clients, online friends, social media comments, vendors, and so on. </p>

<p>Through experience, exposure, feedback, opportunity, practice, and so on, we’ve picked up an ability to gauge outcomes around these people. This lets us act in ways that can seem miraculous to others—especially if someone confuses our years of familiarity and practice for some kind of exceptional, one-off ability.</p> 

<p>By themselves, these sharper skills with humor are neither good nor bad. Sometimes they’re used for negative manipulation. Other times, we start relying on them, and we fall into a rut that prevents us from using other ways of relating to others. And sometimes we overextend ourselves—or trick ourselves into thinking we’re better at a sharp social skill than we really are.</p> 

<p>But what <sem>is</sem> good is understanding how all this happens. It can help us deal with the humor we feel unexpectedly from high-velocity experiences, including when it’s part of negative manipulation—as well as reducing how often humor strikes us as confusing or mysterious.</p>

<p>We can talk about humor with spatial metaphors. By thinking of a humor outcome as a destination, we can think about dynmaic emotional situations and why humor is or isn't generated in them.</p> 

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Humor is a process that involves the direct or indirect participation of everyone. We can defend tripwires, redirect,</p>
    </li> 
    
    <li>
        <p>Humor is something we work to, over time. This lets us think about what's involved in generating humor.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <p>We can push to humor outcomes with different velocity. </p>
    </li>
</ul>



<p>“Outcome-first” and “emotion-first” are just broad thinking strategies about how we go about generating and using humor—and we can use them to jog our thinking into a new perspective. </p>
