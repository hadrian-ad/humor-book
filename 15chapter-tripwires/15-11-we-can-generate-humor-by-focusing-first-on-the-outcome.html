    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can generate humor by focusing first on the outcome</h1>
    
<p>Loosely, there are two approaches to thinking about accomplishing things with humor:</p>

<ul>
   <li>An “emotion-first” method, which treats a humor outcome as a consequence of humor. <callback>("If they laugh, they'll reach a humor outcome.")</callback></li>
    <li>An “outcome-first” method, which treats humor as a consequence of a humor outcome. <callback>("If they reach a humor outcome, they'll laugh")</callback></li>
    </ul>

<p>These two approaches let us talk about the same thing in different ways:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none">
   <li><term>Emotion-first:</term> “If he laughs, I’ll have handled his criticism”</li>
    
    <li><em>Outcome-first:</em> “If I handle his criticism, he’ll laugh”</li>
    </ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: none">
    <li><term>Emotion-first:</term> “If I feel humor, I’ll have dealt with a taboo topic”</li>
    
    <li><em>Outcome-first:</em> “If I deal with a taboo topic, I’ll feel humor”</li>
    </ul>

           <ul style="list-style-type: none">    
            
            <li><term>Emotion-first:</term> “If they feel humor, I’ll have eased their tensions.”</li>
        
            <li><em>Outcome-first:</em> “If they ease their tensions, they’ll feel humor.”</li> 
                </ul>
                
<p>Essentially, this is like X = Y. If we <term>only</term> think we can only solve for X, we'll limit our approach. But if we <em>also</em> realize we can also solve for Y, we'll have much greater flexibility in different situations.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're welcoming new employees we'll want there to be at least some humor. But if we’re stuck on emotion-first methods ("how can I make them laugh?"), we may only think about jokes, funny voices, zany icebreakers, and so on. (“If we all laugh, we’ll ease tension.”)</p> 
    
        <p class="for-instance-text">But we can use an outcome-first method to think more broadly. When we focus on a humor outcome (“how can I ease tension?”), we think of a different set of things—acts of inclusion, compliments, displays of equality, gifts, hospitality, tours, warm welcomes, and so on—all of which can generate humor when done well.</p>

        <div class="chapter-end">
    <p>That's the end of this chapter! Next, we'll look at the "appropriateness" of humor.</p>

    <div class="content">


<p>In this chapter, we looked at humor = humor outcome. We sometimes think we have to focus on humor to reach these outcomes (emotions-first)—but in this chapter, we saw we can also focus on humor outcomes too (outcome-first).</p> 

<p>“Outcome-first” and “emotion-first” are just broad thinking strategies about how we go about generating and using humor—and we can use them to jog our thinking into a new perspective. </p>
