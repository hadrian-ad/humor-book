    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can generate humor by focusing first on the outcome</h1>

    
<p>Loosely, there are two approaches to thinking about accomplishing things with humor:</p>

<ul>
   <li>An <vocab>emotion-first</vocab> method, which treats a humor outcome as a consequence of humor. <callback>("If they laugh, they'll reach a humor outcome.")</callback></li>
    <li>An <vocab>outcome-first</vocab> method, which treats humor as a consequence of a humor outcome. <callback>("If they reach a humor outcome, they'll laugh")</callback></li>
    </ul>

<p>These two approaches let us talk about the same thing in different ways:</p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
   <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> “If he laughs, I’ll have handled his criticism”</li>
    
    <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> “If I handle his criticism, he’ll laugh”</li>
    </ul>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> “If I feel humor, I’ll have dealt with a taboo topic”</li>
    
    <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> “If I deal with a taboo topic, I’ll feel humor”</li>
    </ul>

           <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">    
            
            <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> “If they feel humor, I’ll have eased their tensions.”</li>
        
            <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> “If they ease their tensions, they’ll feel humor.”</li> 
                </ul>
                
<p>Essentially, this is like X = Y. If we  think we can <term>only</term> solve for X, we'll limit our approach. But if we realize we can <em>also</em> solve for Y, 
we'll have much greater flexibility in different situations.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're welcoming new employees we'll want there to be at least some humor. But if we’re stuck on emotion-first methods <callback>("how can I make them laugh?")</callback>, we may only think about jokes, funny voices, zany icebreakers, and so on. <callback>(“If we all laugh, we’ll ease tension.”)</callback></p> 
    
        <p class="for-instance-text">But we can use an outcome-first method to think more broadly. When we focus on a humor outcome <callback>(“how can I ease tension?”)</callback>, we think of a different set of things—acts of inclusion, compliments, displays of equality, gifts, hospitality, tours, warm welcomes, and so on—all of which can generate humor when done well.</p>

<div class="content-example">

  <p>We can put everything together to look at some case studies using signage. We'll see how humor outcomes can be used as tools to interpret situations and design for effectiveness.</p> 
   
  <p>To start, we notice that what makes signs effective is <term>humor</term>&mdash;and what makes signs ineffective is the <em>lack</em> of humor. At first, this can seem odd&mdash;we don't usually think about humor as making signs function.</p> 
  
 <p>However, this makesThis makes more sense when we think about our emotional zones:</p>

 <ul class="close-list">
      
         <li>We'll be confused, disproportionately cautious, upset, and so on by signs that make us feel <sem>mistake-predominant emotions</sem>—like how a sign that says "this public transit system may kill you!" would create unease at odds with its purpose.</li>
      
    <li>We'll reach humor outcomes if the signs make us feel <sem>humor</sem>. If the humor is on relevant topics, we'll feel the sign has <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>leveled criticism acceptably</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>shared perspectives</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
    
      <li>We'll ignore signs that make us feel <sem>OK-predominant emotions</sem>—like a generic caution sign we've seen thousands of times.</li> 
    
        </ul> 
  
<p>This means we'd want to balance mistakes and OKs in the people we'd want the sign to used by. How do we go about doing this? We'll look at case studies at both an outcome-first method of humor and an emotion-first method of humor.</p>

<p>The library recognize an unusual risk, so they decide to put up warning signs. However, due to the novelty of the risk, they decide they need to not just signal a generic "warning" but to actually <humor-outcome>support the argument (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. Recognizing that this is a humor outcome, the library realizes this becomes in part a humor task.</p> 

<p>How can the sign-makers go about generating humor? They could try to generate humor by doing something "funny." But they decided to instead focus on reaching the humor outcome directly—an <sem>outcome-first method</sem>.</p>
 
 <p>
Once they decide this, they don't need to think about "humor" at all&mdash;no need for jokes, comics, cartoon characters, self-reference, or other things typecast as "funny." They instead just focus all their efforts on <humor-outcome>supporting an argument.</humor-outcome> <callback>("If our argument is supported, they'll feel humor.")</callback>
 </p> 

<p>This means they prioritized presenting a compelling argument—they prioritized <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>. They laid out the reasons for caution, with an implied negative consequences if caution isn't exercised.</p>
 
<p>This has to balance mistakes and OKs. They callibrate these by considering their audience <callback>(literate parents)</callback> and thinking about its location <callback>(a library)</callback>. This lets them think about balancing mistakes and OKs in this context for these people, without risking that they'd fall into mistake-predominance or OK-predominance.</p>

<p>Nothing about this sign on the surface is funny, frivolous, insincere, sarcastic, or other things we may associate with comedy. But we saw in a previous example that Justin laughed at this sign—and his humor shows he reaches humor outcome tripwires.</p> 
    
    <p>Among other things, he thought the sign <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>&mdash;and his humor showed the sign was implemented correctly.</p>

     >


<p>The transit company above wanted to <humor-outcome>support an argument  (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. To reach this humor outcome, they could have focused making a strong argument for caution <callback>(outcome-first: "if they feel our argument is supported, they'll feel humor")</callback>. But instead, they used a cartoony allegory to try to balance mistakes and OK <callback>(emotion-first: "if they feel humor, they'll feel our argument is supported")</callback>.</p>

<p>How did they decide between these methods? They thought about their target audience and how people would use their sign. They knew people may not spend much time looking at this sign, so they wanted to avoid long text or complicated visuals to support their arrgument. They also knew that not all the people they're trying to reach can read Turkish. So they decide on something visual.</p>

<p>So they decide an emotion-first method would best help them accomplish their task.</p>

<p>That means they focus first on balancing mistakes and OKs, and don't bother thinking about this in terms of <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>. So they think about how to deviate from someone's expectations&mdash;which they did by showing a bumbling figure carelessly skipping toward an ambushing Death.</p> 

<p>To balance out this mistake, they raise our OK by using an abstract and cartoonish style, and have the negative consequences be implied in the future. Our disassociation from the character and outcome lets us feel secure from negative personal consequences.</p>  

<p>The designers have to callibrate mistakes and OKs based on their audience. For instance, they can make the sign more or less like other warning signs to modulate the mistake&mdash;or make the drawing more or less realistic to modulate the OK. If the audience feels humor, they'll have <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome> and accomplished their goal.</p>

<div class="content-example">                         
<p>Task: A church wants to prevent cars cutting through their parking lot. So they decide to make a sign to that effect. How do they go about making an effective sign?</p>
            
<p>They start by thinking about they want their sign to achieve: they want to <humor-outcome>control/influence situations (by making drivers voluntarily stop cutting through)</humor-outcome>. In other words, the church wants their sign to generate humor.</p>

<p>They think about the most obvious sign they could think of <callback>("no cutting through")</callback>&mdash;and decide this probably wouldn't generate humor in a way that influenced a situation as much as they would like.</p> 

<p>So they think about using an outcome-first method of design. They brainstorm some of the most obvious ways to rush humor outcome tripwires&mdash;like by listing stats to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>; using a graphic of elderly or young church goers to <humor-outcome>share a perspective</humor-outcome>; bonding with readers by <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome><callback> ("hey, good neighbor!—please don't cut through")</callback>; and so on.</p> 

<p>They evaluate these approaches for suitability. Most of them have drawbacks: graphics are expensive to commission; stats take space to present effectively, especially to people in cars who are distant and fast-moving; elaborate sentences take time to read, which drivers don't always have; and so on.</p>

<p>So they set aside outcome-first methods, and brainstorm emotion-first methods. They take their standard idea <callback>("no cutting through")</callback> and think about how they could make it deviate from people's expectations. They think about adding colors, using an unusual shape or size, choosing an odd font, using odd phrasing; using slang; reverse psychology; and so on.</p>

<p>None of these add velocity toward a <humor-outcome>control a situation tripwire</humor-outcome>. <callback>(Not outcome-first)</callback> But they <sem>do</sem> have the advantage of meshing with the constraints of their sign.</p>

<p>So they pick a few of the emotion-first ideas that they thought were thematically relevant to the church, using gothic script and archaic English to make a sign that says "Thou Shalt Not Cut Through." They make an emotional forecast that many drivers would have balanced mistakes and OKs at this sign, which would reduce the rate of cutting through by <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>.

<p>Notice that these two methods "outcome-first" and "emotion-first" aren't actually distinct categories—they're just practical ways of relating ourselves to the same process, and gaining different perspectives on how and why we generate humor.</p>

   Supplemental (Mechanism of influence)
    
    </button>
        
<div class="content-example">  
             
<p>One humor outcome is <humor-outcome>influence/control a situation</humor-outcome>. Of course, there are other ways we can control a situation&mdash;someone can threaten us with a lawsuit, call the police, or draw a knife. They may use these to influence/control a situation without humor.</p> 

<p>We can be more specific about humor outcomes. In this book, humor is the mechanism of <vocab>concordant</vocab> influence. "Concord" is a useful word that implies mutual agreement of purpose. It etymologically means "hearts (acting) together."</p>

<p>So if someone wants us to move our bags, they can try to coerce us&mdash;but if they're successful, it won't be <term>concordant</term> influence. It'll be <em>coercive</em> influence. On the other hand, if they smile as they ask and we smile in return we may move our bags through mutual alignment&mdash;in which case, the emotion of humor was the mechanism of concordant influence.</p>

 <p>We experience coercive influence all the time <callback>(mistake-predomiant influence)</callback>&mdash;which is why we obey petty police officers; no entry signs; foolish professors; confusing tax forms; grasping managers; domineering parents; and so on. These <sem>compel</sem> compliance through non-concordant means. </p>

<p>We also experience inertial or status quo influence all the time <callback>(OK-predominant influence)</callback>&mdash;which by being OK-predominant is often invisible. This is like when we take a familiar route over another; wear one style of clothing and not another; use one calendar system and not another; and so on.</p> 
   
<p>In this book, humor outcomes are outcomes achieved through concord. It's the way we <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective (through concord)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>reveal a personal review (through concord)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>acceptably critizize (through concord)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<p>In that sense, humor is the line between influence by tradition and coercion, which makes humor the concordant method of change: the mechanism of influence, of perspective-giving, rapport-creating, tie-making, and so on. There is no other concordant way to do this other than humor.</p> 
   
 <p>This is a core idea to this book&mdash;and is often an unfamiliar one to handle. It also has some odd implications that we'll be carefully following as we go through this book. Overall, it's something we'll be making sense of piece-by-piece as we progress.</p>

<p>Spatial metaphors are useful in day-to-day thinking about humor. By thinking of a humor outcome as an objective in space, we can think about methods and obstacles in reaching that space.</p> 

Humor is a process that involves the direct or indirect participation of everyone. We can defend tripwires, redirect, 

Humor is something we work to, over time. This lets us think about what's involved in generating humor.

We can push to humor outcomes with different velocity. 



<p>“Outcome-first” and “emotion-first” are just broad thinking strategies about how we go about generating and using humor—and we can use them to jog our thinking into a new perspective. </p>
