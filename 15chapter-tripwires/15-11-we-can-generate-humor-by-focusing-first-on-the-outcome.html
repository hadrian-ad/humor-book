    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can generate humor by focusing first on the outcome</h1>

    
<p>Loosely, there are two approaches to thinking about accomplishing things with humor:</p>

<ul>
   <li>An <vocab>emotion-first</vocab> method, which treats a humor outcome as a consequence of humor. <callback>("If they laugh, they'll reach a humor outcome.")</callback></li>
    <li>An <vocab>outcome-first</vocab> method, which treats humor as a consequence of a humor outcome. <callback>("If they reach a humor outcome, they'll laugh")</callback></li>
    </ul>

<p>These two approaches let us talk about the same thing in different ways:</p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
   <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> “If he laughs, I’ll have handled his criticism”</li>
    
    <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> “If I handle his criticism, he’ll laugh”</li>
    </ul>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> “If I feel humor, I’ll have dealt with a taboo topic”</li>
    
    <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> “If I deal with a taboo topic, I’ll feel humor”</li>
    </ul>

           <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">    
            
            <li><sem>Emotion-first:</sem> “If they feel humor, I’ll have eased their tensions.”</li>
        
            <li><sem>Outcome-first:</sem> “If they ease their tensions, they’ll feel humor.”</li> 
                </ul>
                
<p>Essentially, this is like X = Y. If we  think we can <term>only</term> solve for X, we'll limit our approach. But if we realize we can <em>also</em> solve for Y, 
we'll have much greater flexibility in different situations.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're welcoming new employees we'll want there to be at least some humor. But if we’re stuck on emotion-first methods <callback>("how can I make them laugh?")</callback>, we may only think about jokes, funny voices, zany icebreakers, and so on. <callback>(“If we all laugh, we’ll ease tension.”)</callback></p> 
    
        <p class="for-instance-text">But we can use an outcome-first method to think more broadly. When we focus on a humor outcome <callback>(“how can I ease tension?”)</callback>, we think of a different set of things—acts of inclusion, compliments, displays of equality, gifts, hospitality, tours, warm welcomes, and so on—all of which can generate humor when done well.</p>

    Method and case studies

<div class="content-example">

   <p>We can look at case studies of using humor in signs, and the method at which that humor was arrived at.</p> 
   
  <p>What makes many signs effective is humor. What makes signs ineffective is the lack of humor</p>:
   
 <ul>
    <li>We'll ignore signs that make us feel OK-predominant emotions—like a generic caution sign we've seen thousands of times.</li> 
       
      <li> We'll be confused, disproportionately cautious, upset, and so on by signs that make us feel mistake-predominant emotions—like how a sign that says "this public transit system may kill you!" would create unease at odds with its purpose.</li>
       
        <li> We'll reach humor outcomes if the signs make us feel humor. If the humor is on relevant topics, we'll feel the sign has <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>leveled criticism acceptably</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>shared perspectives</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
        </ul> 
  
<p>Since humor is important, we'd have to have a method to try to generate humor with out sign. We'll look at case studies at both an outcome-first method of humor and an emotion-first method of humor.</p>

<p>The library wants to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome> (that caution should be exercised). The sign-makers could try to do this by doing something "funny." But they decided to focus on reaching the humor outcome directly—an outcome-first method.</p>
 
 <p>
     That means they didn't need to think about "humor" at all. They instead focused all their effort on <humor-outcome>supporting an argument.</humor-outcome> <callback>("If our argument is supported, they'll feel humor.")</callback>
 </p> 

<p>This means they prioritized presenting a compelling argument—on <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>. They laid out the reasons for caution, with an implied bad outcome if caution isn't exercised. In a previous example, we saw Justin laugh at this sign the first time he sees it—and his humor shows he reaches humor outcome tripwires.</p> 

<p>Nothing about this sign on the surface is funny, frivolous, insincere, sarcastic, or other things we may associate with comedy. The reason we may find it funny is the likelihood is the intention or likelihood of someone reaching humor outcomes from it.</p>

<p>The transit company above wanted to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome> (that caution should be exercised). To reach this humor outcome, they could have focused making a strong argument for caution <callback>(outcome-first)</callback>. But they instead used a cartoony allegory to try to match mistakes and OK <callback>(emotion-first)</callback>. <callback>("If they feel humor, they'll feel our argument is supported")</callback></p>

<p>To match mistakes and OK, they don't directly think about how to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>. Instead, they just thought about how to deviate from someone's expectations. They did this by showing a bumbling figure carelessly skipping toward an ambushing Death—a mistake.</p> 

<p>To match this mistake, they raise our OK by using an abstract and cartoonish style. Our disassociation from the character lets us secure from negative personal consequences.</p>  

<p>The designers have to tune mistakes and OKs based on their audience. If the people they test the drawing on are bored, they'd have to raise the mistake or shrink the OK—by changing the realism, the demeanor of the character, or so on. Then, if the audience feels humor, they'll have <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>.</p>

   Method #1 (Emotion-first or outcome-first?)
    
    </button>
        
<div class="content-example">
  
<p>Why choose one method or the other? Sometimes it's just preference—but it's also controlled by what would generate humor.</p> 

<p>The transit sign knew that some of its audience were children or people who couldn't read Turkish. This means they needed to have a sign that wasn't based on writing, but was otherwise effective to these groups.</p> 

<p>By contrast, the sign in the library expected a literate audience and thought that a "funny" sign would be seen as frivolous or confusing (mistake-predominant emotions)—but in a library a "serious" sign is what actually balances mistakes and OKs for him.</p>

<p>To make these decisions, we think about where the sign will be placed. Will that place generally have a large or small OK? We also think about who will be reading the sign. What will these people see as small and large mistakes?</p> 

<p>We also make practical decisions. Will the sign have lots of space to make an long argument? Will people have time to spend with the sign, or will they be passing quickly in a visually busy environment?</p>

   Method #2 (Working backword)

<div class="content-example">                         
<p>A church wants to prevent cars cutting through their parking lot, and wants to make a sign to that effect. How do they go about doing this?</p>
            
<p>First, they think about the humor outcome their church wants to achieve: they wanted to <humor-outcome>control/influence situations</humor-outcome> (by preventing some cars from cutting through). In other words, the church wants their sign to generate humor to control a situation.</p>

<p>Second, they thought about the most obvious sign they could think of. <callback>("No cutting through.")</callback> They decided this probably wouldn't generate humor in a way that influenced a situation as much as they would like.</p> 

<p>So third, they thought about using an outcome-first method of design. They thought about the most obvious ways to rush humor outcome tripwires, like by listing stats to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>; using a graphic of elderly or young church goers to <humor-outcome>share a perspective</humor-outcome>; bonding with readers by <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome><callback>("hey, good neighbor!—please don't cut through")</callback>.</p> 

<p>Fourth, are evaluated for suitability. Most of them have drawbacks: graphics are expensive; stats take space to present effectively, especially to people in cars; elaborate sentences take time to read, which drivers don't always have; and so on.</p>

<p>Fifth, we'd try thinking about an emotion-first method. They took the standard idea <callback>("no cutting through")</callback> and thought about how they could make it deviate from people's expectations. They thought about adding colors, using an unusual shape or size, choosing an odd font, or using archaic English.</p>

<p>None of these have particularly high velocity toward a <humor-outcome>control a situation tripwire</humor-outcome>. But they're possible within the constraints of their sign.</p>

<p>So we'd pick a few that we thought were thematically relevant to the church, making an emotional forecast that this would help these mistakes be seen as OK. And we'd end up with a sign using gothic script saying "Thou Shalt Not Cut Through."

    <p>These two methods "outcome-first" and "emotion-first" aren't distinct categories—ultimately, they're the same process. These categories are just part of some practical methods ways of gaining different perspectives on the same thing: generating humor.</p>

    <p><headline>Mechanism of influence.</headline> One of our humor outcomes is <humor-outcome>control/influence a situation</humor-outcome>—and in this book, humor is how situations are emotionally controlled or influenced.</p>  
    <p>At first, this can seem weird and hard to see in our own lives. Sometimes, that's because we're used to coercion. We may obey a boring sign, a gruff police officer, a foolish professor, and so on—not because we're giving concordant compliance, but because enforcement compels compliance through non-concordant means.</p> 
    
    <p>But what happens when there's no coercion? Among people with genuine equality of agency, it ends up being humor that's the mechanism of influence. If someone comes up to us and gruffly tries to order us to do something, we won't. On the other hand, if that person comes up to us and smiles and gets us to laugh—they'll be genuinely influencing the situation in an interpersonal sense.</p> 

    <p>In the absence of coercion, it's humor—and only humor—that's the mechanism of influence, perspective-giving, rapport-creating, tie-making, and so on. This is something we'll be continuing to make sense of as we progress through this book.</p>

<p>Spatial metaphors are useful in day-to-day thinking about humor. By thinking of a humor outcome as an objective in space, we can think about methods and obstacles in reaching that space.</p> 

Humor is a process that involves the direct or indirect participation of everyone. We can defend tripwires, redirect, 

Humor is something we work to, over time. This lets us think about what's involved in generating humor.

We can push to humor outcomes with different velocity. 



<p>“Outcome-first” and “emotion-first” are just broad thinking strategies about how we go about generating and using humor—and we can use them to jog our thinking into a new perspective. </p>
