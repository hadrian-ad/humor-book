    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Tripwires help us see synchronization</h1>
    

<p>When our evaluations are synchronized, the situational ball moves similarly for everyone—so synchronized people all feel humor at around the same time:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Middle school Emma is watching her brother playing StormConQuest.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>As he sneaks up on an evil kobold, his torch hits an exploding barrel, suddenly flinging his character through the cavern walls in a glitchy mess. It makes Emma and her brother jump in surprise.</narration></p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>Emma laughs and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma feels she has <humor-outcome>gotten through a stressful situation</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>

<p>By contrast, when people <sem>don't</sem> have synchronized evaluations, the situational ball isn’t the same:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor is carelessly cutting onions, and Yasmin tells him to be careful.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speech>“Shit!”</speech> <narration>Trevor drops the knife and puts his finger into his mouth.</narration> <speech>“I almost severed my pinky!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Yasmin comes over, ashen-faced. Then Trevor waves his hand. Just joking. He laughs at her reaction.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Trevor feels he <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><narration>She stares at him, furious.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin <outcome-contrast>doesn't</outcome-contrast> feel humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Yasmin <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> feel Trevor <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>

<p>We saw the same thing with Xiaowei and Heather. Xiaowei felt he <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled her complaint</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>—and so he felt humor. By contrast, Heather felt he <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>created</outcome-contrast> conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>exerbated</outcome-contrast> her complaint</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>lost</outcome-contrast> control of a situation</humor-outcome>—and so she didn’t feel humor.</p>

    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We talked before about how evaluations on an emotion network can be <a href="../12chapter-emotion-network/12-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks-by-synchronizing.html">synchronized or desynchronized</a>. Humor outcomes help us make this idea more tangible. <callback>("Do both people feel a <humor-outcome>complaint has been handled</humor-outcome>?")</callback></p> 
     
    <p class="considertext">If one person feels someone <humor-outcome>handled a complaint</humor-outcome> and the other doesn't, they're not emotionally synchronized. They have desynchronized evaluations&mdash;they don't share an evaluatory perspective.</p>
      </div>
    
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Resynchronize.</headline> When Trevor pranks Yasmin, we can describe Trevor’s humor outcomes as a <term>“good”</term> experience <term>for Trevor</term>. We can do this even at the same time we also see his humor outcomes as related to <em>"bad"</em> experiences <em>for Yasmin</em>, since she felt angry and hurt.</p>
    
    
    <p>We treat others as equals when we care about arriving at synchronized evaluations. So if Trevor wants to treat Yasmin as an equal, he has to both notice and care about their desynchronization. By resynchronizing, they'll eventually feel mutual humor&mdash;mutual<emotions> reconciliation</emotions>.</p> 
    
    <p>This resynchronization will probably need to be initiated and guided by Trevor, since he took the action that led to desynchronization in the first place. To do so, he’ll have to bring their situational balls back into greater alignment&mdash;they'll have to converge on a shared evaluatory perspective.</p>
       
        <p>The first step is for Trevor to notice their diverging emotional states. The next step is to give equal weight of consideration to Yasmin’s evaluations as he does to his own evaluations. If both people put in this effort, they'll become become more and more re-synchronized.</p>
