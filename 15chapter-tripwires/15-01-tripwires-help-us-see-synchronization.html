    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Tripwires help us see synchronization</h1>
    

<p>When our evaluations are synchronized, the situational ball moves similarly for everyone—so synchronized people all feel humor at around the same time:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Middle school Emma is watching her brother playing StormConQuest.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>As he sneaks up on an evil kobold, his torch hits an exploding barrel, suddenly flinging his character through the cavern walls in a glitchy mess. It makes Emma and her brother jump in surprise.</narration></p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>Emma laughs and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma feels she has passed a stressful situation)</notes></p>
     
    <p><narration>Her brother laughs and laughs at the same time.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Christian feels humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Christian feels he has survived stressful situations)</notes></p>

<p>By contrast, when people <sem>don't</sem> have synchronized evaluations, the situational ball isn’t the same:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor is carelessly cutting onions, and Yasmin tells him to be careful.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speech>“Shit!”</speech> <narration>Trevor drops the knife and puts his finger into his mouth.</narration> <speech>“I almost severed my pinky!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Yasmin comes over, ashen-faced. Then Trevor waves his hand. Just joking. He laughs at her reaction.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Trevor doesn’t feel Trevor avoided conflict)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><narration>She stares at him, furious.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin doesn't feel humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Yasmin doesn’t feel Trevor avoided conflict)</notes></p>

<p>We saw the same thing with Xiaowei and Heather. Xiaowei felt he <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled her complaint</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>—and so he felt humor. By contrast, Heather felt he <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>created</outcome-contrast> conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>exerbated</outcome-contrast> her complaint</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>lost</outcome-contrast> control of a situation</humor-outcome>—and so she didn’t feel humor.</p>

    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We talked before about how evaluations on an emotion network can be <a href="../12chapter-emotion-network/12-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks-by-synchronizing.html">synchronized or desynchronized</a>. Humor outcomes help us make this idea more tangible. <callback>("Do both people feel a <humor-outcome>complaint has been handled</humor-outcome>?")</callback></p> 
     
    <p class="considertext">If <term>one</term> person feels someone <humor-outcome>handled a complaint</humor-outcome> and the <em>other</em> <outcome-contrast>doesn't</outcome-contrast>, they're not emotionally synchronized. They have desynchronized evaluations. Humor outcomes let us talk about evaluatory perspective in a narrative way.</p>
      </div>
    
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Resynchronize.</headline> When Trevor pranks Yasmin, we can individually describe Trevor’s humor outcomes as a “good” experience while it lasts <term>for Trevor</term>. We can do this even at the same time we also see elements of the situation as bad <em>for Yasmin</em>, since she felt angry and hurt.</p>
    
    
    <p>When we care about arriving at synchronized evaluations, we treat others as equals. So if Trevor wants to treat Yasmin as an equal, he has to both notice and care about their desynchronization. They’ll need to take time to resynchronize and eventually feel mutual humor&mdash;mutual<emotions> reconciliation</emotions>.</p> 
    
    <p>This resynchronization will probably need to be initiated and guided by Trevor, since he took the action that led to desynchronization in the first place.</p>  
         
    <p>To do so, he’ll have to bring their situational balls back into greater alignment. The first step is for him to notice their diverging emotional states. The next step is to give equal weight of consideration to Yasmin’s evaluations as he does to his own evaluations. If both people put in this effort, their situational balls will become more and more re-synchronized around the memory of this experience.</p>
