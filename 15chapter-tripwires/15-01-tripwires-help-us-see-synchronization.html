    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Tripwires help us see synchronization</h1>
    

<p>When we’re synchronized, the situational ball moves similarly for everyone—which is why synchronized people all feel humor at around the same time:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Middle school Emma is watching her brother playing StormConQuest.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>As he sneaks up on an evil kobold, his torch hits an exploding barrel, suddenly flinging his character through the cavern walls in a glitchy mess. It makes Emma and her brother jump in surprise, and then they both laugh and laugh.</narration></p>
    </div>
    
<p>Emma: humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma feels she has survived stressful situations</p>

<p>Christian: humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Christian feels he has survived stressful situations.</p>

 


<p>By contrast, the situational ball isn’t the same across different people when we’re desynchronized:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor is carelessly cutting onions, and Yasmin tells him to be careful.</narration></p>
    
    <p>“Shit!” <narration>Trevor drops the knife and puts his finger into his mouth.</narration> “I almost severed my pinky!”</p>
    
    <p><narration>Yasmin comes over, ashen-faced. Then Trevor waves his hand. Just joking. He laughs at her reaction. She stares at him, furious.</narration> <notes>(&larr;lack of humor tells show a humor outcome has not occurred&harr;&#xFE0E;Yasmin doesn’t feel Trevor avoided conflict)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
<p>Trevor: humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Trevor feels he has avoided conflict</p>

<p>Yasmin: no humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Yasmin feels Trevor has not avoided conflict</p>

 


<p>We saw the same thing with Xiaowei and Heather. Xiaowei felt he avoided conflict, handled her complaint, and controlled the situation—and so he felt humor. By contrast, Heather felt he created conflict, exerbated her complaint, and lost control of a situation—and so she didn’t feel humor.</p>


 

 

<p>Resynchronize. When Trevor pranks Yasmin, we can individually describe Trevor’s humor outcomes as “good” for him. We can do this even if we also see elements of the situation as bad, since Yasmin felt angry and hurt.</p>

 

<p>We treat others as equals by caring about synchronizing with them. If Trevor wants to equal-rank Yasmin, he has to both notice and care about their desynchronization. They’ll need to resynchronize—feel reconciliation—feel mutual humor. This will probably need to be driven by him, since he took the action that led to desynchronization in the first place.</p>

 

<p>To do so, he’ll have to bring their situational balls back into greater alignment. The first step is for him to notice their diverging emotional states. The next step is to give equal weight of consideration to Yasmin’s evaluations. Going forward, Trevor can use this desynchronization to calibrate how he goes about generating mutual humor with Yasmin.</p>
