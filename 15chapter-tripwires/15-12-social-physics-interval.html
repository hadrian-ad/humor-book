    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">2. Humor is an emotion</h1>
    
    
    
    Loosely, there are two approaches to thinking about accomplishing things with humor:

    An “emotion-first” method, which treats a humor outcome as a consequence of humor. ("If they laugh, they'll reach a humor outcome.")
    An “outcome-first” method, which treats humor as a consequence of a humor outcome. ("If they reach a humor outcome, they'll laugh")

These two approaches let us talk about the same thing in different ways:

Emotion-first: “If he laughs, I’ll have handled his criticism”

Outcome-first: “If I handle his criticism, he’ll laugh”

Emotion-first: “If I feel humor, I’ll have dealt with a taboo topic”

Outcome-first: “If I deal with a taboo topic, I’ll feel humor”

Emotion-first: “If they feel humor, I’ll have eased their tensions.”

Outcome-first: “If they ease their tensions, they’ll feel humor.” 

Essentially, this is like X = Y. If we think we can only solve for X, we'll limit our approach. But if we realize we can also solve for Y, we'll have greater flexibility. 

In this chapter, we looked at humor = humor outcome. We sometimes think we have to focus on humor to reach these outcomes (emotions-first)—but in this chapter, we saw we can also focus on humor outcomes too (outcome-first). 

“Outcome-first” and “emotion-first” are just broad thinking strategies about how we go about generating and using humor—and we can use them to jog our thinking into a new perspective. 
> Consider: 
For instance, if we're welcoming new employees we'll want there to be at least some humor. But if we’re stuck on emotion-first methods ("how can I make them laugh?"), we may only think about jokes, funny voices, zany icebreakers, and so on. (“If we all laugh, we’ll ease tension.”) 

But we can use an outcome-first method to think more broadly. When we focus on a humor outcome (“how can I ease tension?”), we think of a different set of things—acts of inclusion, compliments, displays of equality, gifts, hospitality, tours, warm welcomes, and so on—all of which can generate humor when done well.
