<p>We sometimes come across humor that seems to violate the laws of social physics. We may hear someone say something cruel, extractive, flirtatious, insulting, or so on to a stranger—and then the stranger laughs!</p>

<p>Sometimes these observations go against how we think interactions are supposed to work, and because of this they can seem confusing or mysterious. But once we know how to think about it, the humor in these situations isn’t confusing or mysterious.</p>

<p>The people in these examples are just using outcome-first methods of generating humor. They’re rushing humor outcome tripwires like control a situation, reveal a personal view, reduce defensiveness, create rapport, acceptably criticize, avoid conflict, or so on—and the high velocity rushes the comments across tripwires before anyone can deflect them.</p> 

<p>This isn't random, unknowable, or at all outside any normal pattern of humor—it doesn't break any laws of social physics.</p>

<p>At first, these sharp, outcome-first humor attempts might seem like gambles—like someone is rolling the dice on whether someone feels anger or humor. But there’s actually no gambling in the examples above, since everyone had high confidence that the person they were talking to would laugh and not be offended.</p> 

<p>We already know what this feels like! We do this all the time, when we know whether or not someone will feel humor before we make a comment:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*putting on tie*</action> <action>*walking into bedroom*</action> “And how are you today, my little crab cake?” <notes>(&larr;Sam knows Jennifer will laugh at this)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> “That’s the worst one yet!”</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    </div>
    
<p>When Sam uses a joke nickname with Jennifer, he isn't sweating and crossing his fingers. ("Oh god oh god I hope this lands") He already knows Jennifer will laugh!</p> 

<p>If he thought she’d be annoyed, he wouldn’t have said it—and even if she’s unexpectedly out of sorts, he’s not worried about his ability to adapt to it.</p> 

<p>This is the same feeling everyone in our examples had when they made their sharp comments. Each person had practiced a similar kind of comment with many different kinds of people in similar situations over and over:</p>

<ul style="close-list">
   <li>Elias often flirts with strangers</li>
    <li>Amber often comments on physical appearances of strangers</li>
    <li>Emma is often direct with people</li>
    <li>the waiter deals with dozens of customers each day</li>
    <li>Timothy delivers bad news to patients all the time</li>
    <li>the tutor works with many students each day</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>This constant practice gave them the skill to have a pretty good idea of the emotional outcome in advance. In the same way Sam and Jennifer's constant interaction lets them have high confidence in outcomes, the tutor's constant interaction with clients lets them have high confidence in outcomes.</p>

<p>These comments only appear to be acts of courageous spontaneity if we see them as an isolated, single instance—instead of part of a practiced skill.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If we watched a baseball game and thought all the college athletes were playing for the first time, watching them catch a fly ball would seem like an astonishing, out-of-the-blue miracle.</p>
    
    
    
    <p class="considertext">But we don't think that—because we know they've spent a decade practicing that specific skill! We can be impressed at their dedication and upper-end performance—without thinking the ability to do this arrived from nowhere.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">It's the same thing for humor. It's not an astonishing miracle when Amber makes the server laugh. ("You look terrible.") Instead, it's something she's spent years or even decades practicing.</p>
</div>

<p>How does the tutor knows in advance which student will respond in which way? For instance, how does the tutor know saying "this is terrible" would make Zoe laugh, but not Emma?</p>

<p>Partially, the tutor judges how disposed a client seems to defend which tripwires. This lets the tutor decide which topics to try to generate humor on, and how. With enough clients and clients, the tutor develops an intuitive skill at this.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If the student is arrogant, controlling, demanding, defensive, proud, and so on, they may resist being rushed across controlled the situation tripwire. In this case, the focus may first be on creating rapport.</p> 
    
    
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">By contrast, if the student seems to be looking for advice, nervous, unsure of what to do, uncertain of the quality of their work, willing to put in more work, and so on—then the tutor may judge that they can rush them across control a situation and acceptably criticize tripwires, and in a way the student will appreciate and find productive and positive.</p> </div>

<p>It’s the same for the other examples. Elias, Emma, Amber, Timothy, and the waiter knew in advance how the specific people they were talking too would react. They knew what the likely outcome would be, and were confident they could handle outlier outcomes.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes this outcome-first humor confuses us because of its apparent negativity, like when Amber criticized someone. (“You look terrible.”) But our confusion is caused by an incorrect assumption: that we only feel humor at “good” things, and that we shouldn't feel humor at “bad” things.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">But as we’ve seen, humor doesn’t distinguish between “good” mistakes and “bad” mistakes. All that matters is how much something deviates from our expectations, and whether that’s matched by our sense of security from negative personal consequences.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">If the server feels secure from negative personal consequences, we don’t need to think about ideas like “good” or “bad.” Questions like “was it good or bad for Amber to make that comment?” or "is it good or bad to be told we look terrible?" aren't relevant to thinking about why someone does or doesn't feel humor.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>We can probably find places in our own lives where others would view our own humor skills as miraculous—we just don’t notice this because these skills seem so utterly normal to us. This might be how we interact with new coworkers, freshmen teammates, young children, patients, long-standing clients, online friends, social media comments, vendors, and so on. </p>

<p>Through experience, exposure, feedback, opportunity, practice, and so on, we’ve picked up an ability to gauge outcomes around these people. This lets us act in ways that can seem miraculous to others—especially if someone confuses our years of familiarity and practice for some kind of exceptional, one-off ability.</p> 

<p>By themselves, these sharper skills with humor are neither good nor bad. Sometimes they’re used for negative manipulation. Other times, we start relying on them, and we fall into a rut that prevents us from using other ways of relating to others. And sometimes we overextend ourselves—or trick ourselves into thinking we’re better at a sharp social skill than we really are.</p> 

<p>But what is good is understanding how all this happens. It can help us deal with the humor we feel unexpectedly from high-velocity experiences, including when it’s part of negative manipulation—as well as reducing how often humor strikes us as confusing or mysterious.</p>
