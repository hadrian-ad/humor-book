    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can push toward tripwires fast or slowly</h1>
    
    
<p>We can push toward humor outcomes with different degrees of pressure. Sometimes we make <term>hard</term> pushes to humor outcomes, and sometimes <em>lighter</em> pushes:</p>

<p>This hard or light push is the “velocity” of the situational ball:</p>

<p>When we are direct and insistent on reaching a humor outcome, we <term>increase</term> the velocity. When we’re indirect and tentative, we <em>decrease</em> the velocity:</p>

<p>When the situational ball has high velocity, it can be hard to defend a tripwire. It can reach it so suddenly, we find ourselves almost compelled to laugh&mdash;or laugh almost without even realizing it:</p>
