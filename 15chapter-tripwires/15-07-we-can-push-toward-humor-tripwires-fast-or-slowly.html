We can push toward humor outcomes with different degrees of pressure. Sometimes we make hard pushes to humor outcomes, and sometimes lighter pushes:

 

Harder push to humor outcome

Yasmin’s mother: *without asking* *sets down a glass of water* “Here, I got you some water!” (<- pushes hard toward help Trevor become accepted)

Trevor: “Oh. Thank you.” *smiles* (<- Trevor feels accepted)

- OR -

Lighter push to humor outcome

Yasmin’s mother: “Want some tea, pop, water?” (<- pushes lightly toward help Trevor become accepted)

Trevor: *shakes head* “No thank you, I’m good.” (<- Trevor doesn’t feel accepted)

Yasmin’s mother: “No really, you’d make me feel happy to get you something. What would you like?” (<- pushes a bit harder toward help Trevor become accepted)

Trevor: *smiles* “Well, I guess I wouldn’t mind some soda.” (<- Trevor feels accepted) 



This hard or light push is the “velocity” of the situational ball:

 

When we are direct and insistent on reaching a humor outcome, we increase the velocity. When we’re indirect and tentative, we decrease the velocity:

Harder push to humor outcome

Minh matches with Amaya on a dating app.

Amaya: *texting* “Gosh you’re cute.” (<- pushes hard toward reveal a personal view <-> high velocity)

Minh: *flushes* *smiles* (<- Minh feels Amaya revealed a personal view)
- OR -
Lighter push to humor outcome

Minh matches with Amaya on a dating app.

Amaya: *texting* “When I saw your picture, I immediately thought of something that rhymes with chute.” (<- pushes lightly toward reveal a personal view <-> low velocity)

Minh: (confused) *smiles* (<- Minh feels some humor at Amaya’s pun)

 

 

When the situational ball has high velocity, it can be hard to defend a tripwire. This is when we find ourselves feeling compelled to laugh, or laugh almost without even realizing it: 

Harder push to humor outcome

Tutor: *finishes reading Zoe’s grad school application essay* *sighs* “This is pretty terrible.” (<- pushes hard toward humor outcomes quickly <-> high velocity)

Zoe: (shocked) *laughs* (<- Zoe feels tutor acceptably criticized her) “Really? Oh no.”
- OR -
Lighter push to humor outcome

Tutor: *finishes reading Zoe’s grad school application essay* *sighs* “Hm. Well. There are some things I think are really good, and other things that, well, you know. But really, most good, I mean that. We just gotta drill down a bit on genre and goals.” (<- pushes lightly toward humor outcomes <- low velocity)

Zoe: (confused) “So I’m on the right track?” (<- Zoe is unsure of what the tutor is trying to say)

Harder push to humor outcome

Trevor: *out of the blue* “What do you think about having a kid?” (<- Trevor rushes toward opening a new topic of conversation <-> high velocity)

Yasmin: *puts hand on face* *laughs* (<- Yasmin feels Trevor has opened a new topic of conversation) “Oh god, Trevor. That’s not StormConQuest!”
- OR -
Lighter push to humor outcome

Trevor: *out of the blue* “Look, I’m going to bring up something and I don’t want you to freak out or anything.” (<- Trevor meandors toward humor outcomes <-> low velocity)

Yasmin: *listens impassively* (<- Trevor’s prelude shrinks her OK and grows her mistake

Trevor: (nervous) *pressing on* “I know you haven’t wanted me to bring it up before. I mean, it’s scary and weird, and we both have plans and, I dunno, maybe I’m an asshole for bringing it up, and, I guess, well…” *clears throat* “I mean, have you ever… thought about kids?”

Yasmin: *sighs* “I don’t really want to talk about this now, Trevor” (<- mistake is not OK <-> Yasmin does not feel Trevor has opened a new topic of conversation)
