    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">2. Humor is an emotion</h1>
    
    
<p>We can push toward humor outcomes with different degrees of pressure. Sometimes we make hard pushes to humor outcomes, and sometimes lighter pushes:</p>

 

<p>Yasmin’s mother: *without asking* *sets down a glass of water* “Here, I got you some water!” (&larr;pushes hard toward help Trevor become accepted)</p>

<p>Trevor: “Oh. Thank you.” *smiles* (&larr;Trevor feels accepted)</p>

<p class="or">- OR -</p>

<p>Yasmin’s mother: “Want some tea, pop, water?” (&larr;pushes lightly toward help Trevor become accepted)</p>

<p>Trevor: *shakes head* “No thank you, I’m good.” (&larr;Trevor doesn’t feel accepted)</p>

<p>Yasmin’s mother: “No really, you’d make me feel happy to get you something. What would you like?” (&larr;pushes a bit harder toward help Trevor become accepted)</p>

<p>Trevor: *smiles* “Well, I guess I wouldn’t mind some soda.” (&larr;Trevor feels accepted)</p> 



<p>This hard or light push is the “velocity” of the situational ball:</p>

 

<p>When we are direct and insistent on reaching a humor outcome, we increase the velocity. When we’re indirect and tentative, we decrease the velocity:</p>



<p>Minh matches with Amaya on a dating app.</p>

<p>Amaya: *texting* “Gosh you’re cute.” (&larr;pushes hard toward reveal a personal view&harr;&#xFE0E;high velocity)</p>

<p>Minh: *flushes* *smiles* (&larr;Minh feels Amaya revealed a personal view)</p>

<p class="or">- OR -</p>

<p>Minh matches with Amaya on a dating app.</p>

<p>Amaya: *texting* “When I saw your picture, I immediately thought of something that rhymes with chute.” (&larr;pushes lightly toward reveal a personal view&harr;&#xFE0E;low velocity)</p>

<p>Minh: (confused) *smiles* (&larr;Minh feels some humor at Amaya’s pun)</p>

 

 

<p>When the situational ball has high velocity, it can be hard to defend a tripwire. This is when we find ourselves feeling compelled to laugh, or laugh almost without even realizing it:</p> 



<p>Tutor: *finishes reading Zoe’s grad school application essay* *sighs* “This is pretty terrible.” (&larr;pushes hard toward humor outcomes quickly&harr;&#xFE0E;high velocity)</p>

<p>Zoe: (shocked) *laughs* (&larr;Zoe feels tutor acceptably criticized her) “Really? Oh no.”</p>

<p class="or">- OR -</p>

<p>Tutor: *finishes reading Zoe’s grad school application essay* *sighs* “Hm. Well. There are some things I think are really good, and other things that, well, you know. But really, most good, I mean that. We just gotta drill down a bit on genre and goals.” (&larr;pushes lightly toward humor outcomes &larr;low velocity)</p>

<p>Zoe: (confused) “So I’m on the right track?” (&larr;Zoe is unsure of what the tutor is trying to say)</p>

<p>Trevor: *out of the blue* “What do you think about having a kid?” (&larr;Trevor rushes toward opening a new topic of conversation&harr;&#xFE0E;high velocity)</p>

<p>Yasmin: *puts hand on face* *laughs* (&larr;Yasmin feels Trevor has opened a new topic of conversation) “Oh god, Trevor. That’s not StormConQuest!”</p>

<p class="or">- OR -</p>

<p>Trevor: *out of the blue* “Look, I’m going to bring up something and I don’t want you to freak out or anything.” (&larr;Trevor meandors toward humor outcomes&harr;&#xFE0E;low velocity)</p>

<p>Yasmin: *listens impassively* (&larr;Trevor’s prelude shrinks her OK and grows her mistake</p>

<p>Trevor: (nervous) *pressing on* “I know you haven’t wanted me to bring it up before. I mean, it’s scary and weird, and we both have plans and, I dunno, maybe I’m an asshole for bringing it up, and, I guess, well…” *clears throat* “I mean, have you ever… thought about kids?”</p>

<p>Yasmin: *sighs* “I don’t really want to talk about this now, Trevor” (&larr;mistake is not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;Yasmin does not feel Trevor has opened a new topic of conversation)</p>
