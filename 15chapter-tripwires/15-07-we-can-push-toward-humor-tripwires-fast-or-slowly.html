    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can push toward tripwires fast or slowly</h1>
    
    
<p>We can push toward humor outcomes with different degrees of pressure. Sometimes we make hard pushes to humor outcomes, and sometimes lighter pushes:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Yasmin’s mother: <action>*without asking*</action> <action>*sets down a glass of water*</action> “Here, I got you some water!” <notes>(&larr;pushes hard toward help Trevor become accepted)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> “Oh. Thank you.” <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels accepted)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> “Want some tea, pop, water?” <notes>(&larr;pushes lightly toward help Trevor become accepted)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> *shakes head* “No thank you, I’m good.” <notes>(&larr;Trevor doesn’t feel accepted)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> “No really, you’d make me feel happy to get you something. What would you like?” <notes>(&larr;pushes a bit harder toward help Trevor become accepted)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> “Well, I guess I wouldn’t mind some soda.” <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels accepted)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>

<p>This hard or light push is the “velocity” of the situational ball:</p>

 

<p>When we are direct and insistent on reaching a humor outcome, we increase the velocity. When we’re indirect and tentative, we decrease the velocity:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Minh matches with Amaya on a dating app.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <action>*texting*</action> “Gosh you’re cute.” <notes>(&larr;pushes hard toward reveal a personal view&harr;&#xFE0E;high velocity)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <action>*flushes*</action> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Minh feels Amaya revealed a personal view)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>Minh matches with Amaya on a dating app.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <action>*texting*</action> “When I saw your picture, I immediately thought of something that rhymes with chute.” <notes>(&larr;pushes lightly toward reveal a personal view&harr;&#xFE0E;low velocity)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <internalaction>(confused)</internalaction> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Minh feels some humor at Amaya’s pun)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 

 

<p>When the situational ball has high velocity, it can be hard to defend a tripwire. This is when we find ourselves feeling compelled to laugh, or laugh almost without even realizing it:</p>
