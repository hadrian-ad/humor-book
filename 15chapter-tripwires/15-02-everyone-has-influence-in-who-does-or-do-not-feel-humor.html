<p>Emotional outcomes are shaped by everyone involved, since everyone involved are active participants in the situation.</p> 

<p>This is why Heather has influence on whether or not Xiaowei reaches humor outcomes:</p>

<p>When Heather prevents Xiaowei from feeling like he's <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, and so on—she prevents him from feeling humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>  
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t to say that this is the “best” thing for Heather to do. We’re just looking at how the humor in a situation isn’t predetermined by one person. Instead, both people are involved in creating or preventing humor.</p> 
     </div>
    
<p>Xiaowei can't <term>unilaterally</term> <humor-outcome>handle a complaint</humor-outcome> because he's in a <em>multilateral</em> situation—since Heather  triangulates whether he can feel he <humor-outcome>handles (Heather') complaint</humor-outcome> or not.</p>

   
<div class="box"> 
     <p><headline>Metaphors.</headline> Sometimes we think that generating humor is like kicking balls into an empty net. We sit in front of a comedian, and they try to kick balls into our net to make us laugh. In this metaphor, we're passive, stationary targets for their comments that either "hit or miss" depending on their aim.</p> 
     
     <p>That metaphor sometimes works okay for some comedy shows. But it doesn't work for most of our lives&mdash;since we're <sem>not</sem> actually passive, stationary targets.</p>
     
     <p>Instead, we're often <sem>on</sem> the field ourselves, defending the net or trying to score on theirs. Sometimes times there are many people on the field&mdash;sometimes we have the bigger team, sometimes the smaller team, and sometimes it's a free-for-all. Sometimes there’s clear visibility, and sometimes there’s rain or fog. Sometimes we’re playing for a prize, and sometimes everyone is just playing for fun.</p>
     
     <p>We can use these metaphors to capture some of what it feels like to generate humor in interpersonal situations. It's always different, depending on the situation! But it often feels active and positional—more like playing a game of soccer than it does just practicing shooting goals.</p>
