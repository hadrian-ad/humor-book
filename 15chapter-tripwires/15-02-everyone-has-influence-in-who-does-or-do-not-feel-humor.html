    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Everyone has influence in who does or doesn't feel humor</h1>
    
    
<p>Emotional outcomes are shaped by everyone involved—like how both Heather and Xiaowei are active participants in the situation.</p> 

<p>This is why Heather has influence on whether or not Xiaowei reaches humor outcomes:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Heather: *hands on hips* “Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”</p>
    
    <p>Xiaowei: *playing a game* (listlessly) “When my shit turns blue.” (&larr;Xiaowei pushes the situation toward controlling the situation, handling a complaint, and so on)</p>
    
    <p>Heather: *sits down* *crosses legs* (calmly) “How are you feeling lately?” (&larr;deflects the situation away from those tripwires)</p>
    
    <p>Xiaowei: (annoyed) “Annoyed, right now.” (&larr;Heather preempts Xiaowei from feeling he controlled the situation, handled a complaint, or avoided conflict&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p> 
    
    </div>

<p>When Heather prevents Xiaowei from feeling like he's avoided conflict, controlled the situation, handled complaints, and so on—she prevents him from feeling humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>  
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t to say that this is the “best” thing for Heather to do. We’re just looking at how the humor in a situation isn’t predetermined by one person—instead both people are involved in creating or preventing humor.</p> 
    
    <p>Xiaowei couldn't unilaterally handle a complaint because he's in a multilateral situation—Heather triangulates whether he feels he handles a complain or not, which is something outside his full control.</p>
    
    <p>That's because humor is a multi-person process, in which everyone is involved.</p>
    </div>
 
<p>Metaphors. Sometimes we think that generating humor is like kicking balls into an empty net—like how we sit and see if a comedian can kick balls into our net, making us laugh. We think of their humor as "hit or miss"—we're like stationary targets, and whether we laugh or not depends on their aim.</p> 

<p>But in most of our lives, humor isn’t generated like it's one person kicking balls into our unguarded net. That's because we're sometimes on the field ourselves, defending the net—while other times there are many people on the field. Sometimes we have a bigger team, sometimes a smaller team—sometimes there’s clear visibility, and sometimes there’s rain or fog—sometimes we’re playing for a prize, and sometimes everyone is just having fun.</p>

<p>We can use these metaphors to capture some of what it feels like to generate humor in interpersonal situations. It changes depending on the situation, but often feels active and positional—more like playing soccer than practicing shooting goals.</p>
