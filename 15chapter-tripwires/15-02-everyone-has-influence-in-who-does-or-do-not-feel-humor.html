<p>Emotional outcomes are shaped by everyone involved—like how both Heather and Xiaowei are active participants in the situation.</p> 

<p>This is why Heather has influence on whether or not Xiaowei reaches humor outcomes:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*hands on hips*</action> <speech>“Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”</speech></p>

<p>When Heather prevents Xiaowei from feeling like he's <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, and so on—she prevents him from feeling humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>  
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t to say that this is the “best” thing for Heather to do. We’re just looking at how the humor in a situation isn’t predetermined by one person—instead both people are involved in creating or preventing humor.</p> 
     </div>
    
<p>Xiaowei couldn't unilaterally <humor-outcome>handle a complaint</humor-outcome> because he's in a multilateral situation—Heather triangulates whether he feels he <humor-outcome>handles a complain</humor-outcome> or not, which is something outside his full control.</p>

<p>That's because humor is a multi-person process, in which everyone is involved.</p>
   
<div class="box"> 
     <p><headline>Metaphors.</headline> Sometimes we think that generating humor is like kicking balls into an empty net—like how we sit and see if a comedian can kick balls into our net, making us laugh. We think of their humor as "hit or miss"—we're like stationary targets, and whether we laugh or not depends on their aim.</p> 
     
     <p>But in most of our lives, humor <sem>isn’t</sem> generated like it's one person kicking balls into our unguarded net. That's because sometimes we're on the field <term>ourselves</term>, defending the net—while other times there are <em>many</em> people on the field. Sometimes we have a <term>bigger</term> team, sometimes a <em>smaller</em> team—sometimes there’s clear <term>visibility</term>, and sometimes there’s <em>rain</em> or <em>fog</em>—sometimes we’re playing for a <term>prize</term>, and sometimes everyone is just playing for <em>fun</em>.</p>
     
     <p>We can use these metaphors to capture some of what it feels like to generate humor in interpersonal situations. It changes depending on the situation, but often feels active and positional—more like playing soccer than practicing shooting goals.</p>
