<p>Heather prevents Xiaowei from feeling humor&mdash;by preventing him from feeling like he's <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>  
    
    <p class="considertext">This isn’t to say that this is the “best” thing for Heather to do. We’re just looking at how the humor in a situation isn’t predetermined by one person&mdash;since both people are involved in creating or preventing humor.</p> 
     </div>
    
<p>Xiaowei can't <term>unilaterally</term> <humor-outcome>handle (Heather's) complaint</humor-outcome> because he's in a <em>multilateral</em> situation—he and Heather together triangulate whether he feels he <humor-outcome>handles (Heather's) complaint</humor-outcome> or not.</p>

     <p><headline>Metaphors.</headline> Sometimes we think that generating humor is like kicking balls into an empty net: we sit in front of a comedian, and they try to kick balls into our net to make us laugh. In this metaphor, we're passive, stationary targets. Their comments that either "hit or miss" depending on their aim.</p> 
     
     <p>That metaphor sometimes works okay for some comedy shows. But it doesn't work for most of our lives&mdash;since we're <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> passive, stationary targets.</p>
     
     <p>A better metaphor is that we're not nets&mdash;it's that we're often <sem>on</sem> the field ourselves, defending the net, or trying to score on theirs.</p> 
     
     <p>Sometimes it's a team game, with one side having a bigger and another a smaller team. Sometimes it's a free-for-all where everyone is doing their own thing.  Sometimes there’s clear visibility, and sometimes there’s rain or fog. Sometimes we’re playing for a prize, and sometimes everyone is just playing for fun.</p>
     
     <p>We can use these metaphors to capture some of what it feels like to generate humor in interpersonal situations. While it's always different, depending on the situation, it often feels active and positional—more like playing a game of soccer than it does just practicing shooting goals.</p>
