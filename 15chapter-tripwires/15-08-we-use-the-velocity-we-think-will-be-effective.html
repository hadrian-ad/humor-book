    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">2. Humor is an emotion</h1>
    
  We’ll use the velocity that we think will be effective. If we’re hanging out with our friend, we may not need much velocity to reach humor outcome tripwires.

> Consider: 
For instance, our friends are more indulgent with letting us control a situation ("should we go get ice cream?") than a stranger or our manager would be.
 

By contrast, if we’re trying to derail a conversation, we’ll need something that makes a harder push toward humor outcomes:

 

Harder push

Heather: *hands on hips* “Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”

Xiaowei: *playing a game* (listlessly) “When my shit turns blue.” (&larr;Xiaowei makes a hard push toward humor outcomes&harr;&#xFE0E;high velocity)

Heather: *throws hands up* (&larr;Heather feels Xiaowei is being flippant)

Xiaowei: *laughs* (&larr;mistakes and OKs match&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)

- OR -

Lighter push

Heather: *hands on hips* “Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”

Xiaowei: *playing a game* *trying to make a joke on the fly* “Mom, not until the minimum wage is the drinking age—the chant of my generation. Give us booze or boosted wages, haha.” (&larr;Xiaowei makes a meandering, light push toward humor outcomes&harr;&#xFE0E;low velocity)

Heather: “Well, what about Justin’s brother? He runs a carpet store, you’d earn more than minimum wage.” (&larr;joke doesn’t have enough velocity to derail conversation)

Xiaowei: *sighs* (Slowly) “Justin’s brother’s carpet shop…” (&larr;Xiaowei’s comment didn’t push the situation across any humor tripwires&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)



Xiaowei “rushes” the tripwires by not thinking about humor—instead, he only focuses on avoiding conflict, controlling a situation, handling a complaint, and so on. This high velocity catches Heather off-guard, and allows him to feel humor.

> Consider: 
By contrast, the more conventional joke didn’t have enough velocity to affect the situation—which is why Xiaowei avoided the low-velocity option.

This doesn’t mean a lighter push couldn’t have worked—or that the harder push worked in a strategic sense. Instead, we're looking at why Xiaowei's intuition led him to make a sharper comment.
