    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">It often takes many steps before we feel humor</h1>
    
    
<p>Humor is something we develop a situation toward. Sometimes this happens quickly, in what seems like a single step&mdash;other times it happens more slowly, over what seems like many steps:</p>

<p>In both cases above, humor <outcome-contrast>isn't</outcome-contrast> happening <term>instantaneously</term>&mdash;humor happens after <em>time</em>. Even when humor happens quickly, it's not instantaneous.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">When we listen to a quick pun, we still have to listen to it&mdash;when we hike to the top of a scenic overlook, we still have to hike there. In both cases, our evaluations are changing over time.</p>

    <p>    
    It's obvious it takes time to reach a humor outcome—since we can't always <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome> in one sentence. That's because the person we’re talking with may:</p> 

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>disagree with us at first</li>
        <li>not understand the argument</li>
        <li>ask for clarification</li>
        <li>need more context</li>
        <li>give a counterpoint</li>
        <li>take time to think it over</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To push them into a humor outcome, we have to be aware of how their tripwire is guarded, and be responsive to those guards. It’s only after a shared development of the emotional situation that they’ll feel we’ve <humor-outcome>supported our argument</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>It’s the same for all humor outcomes. Sometimes, we reach these outcomes quickly—but other times, we have to develop the situation that way toward <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<p>If we thought a humor attempt had to be successful from the first sentence, we’d be playing a game with the wrong rules—and we’d often struggle to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on: </p>

<p>Humor takes some situational assembly—which is why it’s often helpful to think of humor as the <term>conclusion</term> that we work toward, rather than <em>beginning</em> that starts something.</p>

     <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext">Since all humor outcomes are connected, a rising tide lifts all boats: improving at <humor-outcome>supporting arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on improves our skill at humor—and improving our skill at humor improves our <humor-outcome>ability to support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

   <div class="box">
         <p><headline>Answers.</headline> We can use each humor outcomes as a method of generating humor. So if we ask: <callback>"How do I generate humor?"</callback> we can answer ourselves with a humor outcome:</p>

          <p class="and-so-on">and so on</p> 
        
        <p>This lets us take an abstract question <callback>("how do I generate humor?")</callback> and downsize it into something tangible&mdash;since we already have an idea on how to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>.

<p>When thinking about generating humor, we have two different approaches:</p> 

<ul style="list-style: none">
   <li>An <vocab>emotion-first</vocab> approach, which treats a humor outcome as a consequence of humor. <callback>("If they laugh, they'll reach a humor outcome.")</callback></li>
    <li>An <vocab>outcome-first</vocab> approach, which treats humor as a consequence of a humor outcome. <callback>("If they reach a humor outcome, they'll laugh")</callback></li>

    <p>Essentially, this is like solving X = Y. Since they have the same value, we can solve the equation by approaching either end.</p> 
    
    <p>If we think we can <term>only</term> solve for X, we'll limit our approach. When we realize we can <em>also</em> solve for Y, 
    we'll have much greater flexibility in how we think about different situations.</p>

    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">
    If we're welcoming a new person to our team, we know we'll want them to smile or laugh. To help them do so, we could focus on the things we associate with smiling or laughing&mdash;jokes, funny voices, goofy icebreakers, and so on.</p>
    
     <p class="for-instance-text">That's an emotion-first approach, which tries to achieve an outcome by first thinking about an emotion.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Alternatively, we could focus on the outcome we want&mdash;so we'd focus on the things we asossociate with <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolizing ties</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, and so on.

<p>The point of all this isn't that there are "two ways" of going about things&mdash;it's instead to help jog our thinking into new perspectives how we go about making emotional actions in our lives.</p>

<p>We can use a spatial metaphor to think about "reaching" humor outcomes. This gives an intuitive way of thinking about why humor does or doesn't happen.</p> 

<ul>
    <li>
        We can think narratively about humor's triggering conditions by thinking of humor outcomes as something the situation <a href="15-00-tripwires.html">develops towards</a>. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Our evaluations are shaped by the direct and indirect participation of everyone. That means that <a href="15-02-everyone-has-influence-in-who-does-or-do-not-feel-humor.html">everyone has a role</a> in whether or not humor outcomes are reached on various topics. 
    </li> 
    
    <li>
        Humor outcomes are reached <a href="15-05-humor-is-something-we-work-toward.html">over time</a>. Since our evaluations don't shift instantaneously, it sometimes takes time and effort to shift evaluations on a topic in certain ways.
