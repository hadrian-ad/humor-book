    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">It often takes many steps before we feel humor</h1>
    
    
<p>Humor is something we develop a situation toward. Sometimes this happens quickly, in what seems like a single step&mdash;other times it happens more slowly, over what seems like many steps:</p>

<p>In both cases above, humor <outcome-contrast>isn't</outcome-contrast> happening <term>instantaneously</term>&mdash;humor takes <em>time</em>.</p>

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">Humor never happens instantaneously, even when it happens quickly. Sometimes our evaluations shift into humor over the course of a split second&mdash;other times over the course of a conversation.
   </p>
    </div>

    
    <p>It takes time to reach a humor outcome&mdash;this is obvious with a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>—since we can't always support an argument in one sentence. That's because the person we’re talking with may:</p> 

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>disagree with us at first</li>
        <li>not understand the argument</li>
        <li>ask for clarification</li>
        <li>need more context</li>
        <li>give a counterpoint</li>
        <li>take time to think it over</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To push them into a humor outcome, we have to be aware of how their tripwire is guarded, and be responsive to those guards. It’s only after a shared development of the emotional situation that they’ll feel we’ve <humor-outcome>supported our argument</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>It’s the same for all humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on. Sometimes, we reach these outcomes quickly—but other times, we have to develop the situation that way. </p>

<p>If we thought a humor attempt was successful or not from the first sentence, we’d be playing a game with the wrong rules—and we’d often struggle to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on: </p>

<p>Humor takes some situational assembly—which is why it’s often helpful to think of humor as the <term>conclusion</term> that we work toward, rather than <em>beginning</em> that starts something.</p>


<div class="consider">

     <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext">Since all humor outcomes are connected, a rising tide lifts all boats: improving at <humor-outcome>supporting arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on improves our skill at humor—and improving our skill at humor improves our <humor-outcome>ability to support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    </div>



   <div class="box">
         <p><headline>Answers.</headline> We can use each humor outcomes as a method of generating humor. So if we ask: <callback>"How do I generate humor?"</callback> we can answer ourselves with a humor outcome:</p> 
        
        <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
           <li>“How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>”</li>
            <li>"How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>"</li>
            <li>"How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>helping someone become accepted</humor-outcome>"</li>
               </ul>   
          <p class="and-so-on">and so on</p> 
        
        <p>This lets us take an abstract question <callback>("how do I generate humor?")</callback> and downsize it into something tangible&mdash;since we already have an idea on how to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>. We can enroll these ideas as part of our overall humor skill.</p>
