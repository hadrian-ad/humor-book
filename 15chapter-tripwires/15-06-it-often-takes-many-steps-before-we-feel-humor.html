    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">2. Humor is an emotion</h1>
    
    
Humor is something we develop a situation toward. This is how all humor happens, even though it’s sometimes a one-step process and sometimes a multi-step process:

In both cases above, humor takes time—it's something the situation develops toward. It's never instantaneous, even though it sometimes happens very quickly. And other times, it takes a long, long while.

 This is obvious with a humor outcome like support an argument—since we don’t always support an argument in one sentence. That's because the person we’re talking with may: 

    disagree with us at first
    not understand the argument
    ask for clarification
    need more context
    give a counterpoint
    take time to think it over

(and so on)

To push them into a humor outcome, we have to be aware of how their tripwire is guarded, and be responsive to them. It’s only after a shared development of the situation that they’ll feel we’ve supported our argument:

 

Trevor: *playing StormConQuest* (frustrated) “I can’t beat the Ogre Time Magistrate. I’ve been trying for hours. It’s just not possible.”

Yasmin: “Did you buy armor potions?” (&larr;Yasmin tries to support an argument)

Trevor: *pause* (confused) “Do magic arrows do physical damage?” (&larr;Trevor doesn’t feel Yasmin has supported an argument)

Yasmin: *smiles* “Half physical, half magical.” (&larr;Yasmin tries to support an argument)

Trevor: *laughs* “Fuuuck me.” (&larr;Trevor feels Yasmin has supported an argument)

 

Yasmin: *pained* “So why do you think sixteen-year-olds should be able to vote?”

Trevor: “Because why not?” (&larr;Trevor tries to support an argument)

Yasmin: “Because they have no life experience! Their brains aren’t developed!” (&larr;Yasmin doesn’t feel Trevor has supported an argument&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)

Trevor: “But we let adults with intellectual disabilities vote, right? So it’s not really about development.” (&larr;Trevor tries to support an argument)

Yasmin: “But they have no life experience.” (&larr;Yasmin doesn’t feel Trevor has supported an argument&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)

Trevor: “But that’s arbitrary? Some dude who’s sixty would say that about someone our age.”

Yasmin: *laughs* (&larr;Yasmin feels Trevor has supported an argument) *shakes head in frustration* “Where have you been hearing all this, Trevor?”

 


It’s the same for all humor outcomes, like easing tension, handling complaints, creating rapport, and so on. Sometimes, we reach these outcomes quickly—but other times, we have to develop the situation that way. 

If we thought a humor attempt had to be successful or not from the first sentence, we’d be playing a game with the wrong rules—and we’d often struggle to support arguments, handle complains, create rapport, and so on: 

 

Humor takes some situational assembly—and it’s often helpful to think of humor as the conclusion that we work toward, rather than beginning that starts something.


Methods. We can use humor outcomes as methods of generating humor. This lets everything become much more tangible and practical. (“How do I generate humor? By supporting an argument”—"How do I generate humor? By revealing personal views," and so on.) 

We know how to support arguments and reveal personal views—and we can enroll these as part of our overall humor skill. This means we already have many methods of generating humor!

Since these are connected, a rising tide lifts all boats: improving at supporting arguments, revealing personal views, and so on improves our skill at humor—and improving our skill at humor improves our ability to support arguments, reveal personal views, and so on.
