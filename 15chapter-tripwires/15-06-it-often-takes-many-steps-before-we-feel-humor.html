    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">It often takes many steps before we feel humor</h1>
    
    
<p>Humor is something we develop a situation toward. This is how all humor happens, even though it’s sometimes a one-step process and sometimes a multi-step process:</p>

<p>In both cases above, humor takes <sem>time</sem>—it's something the situation develops toward. Humor never happens instantaneous, even though it sometimes happens very quickly. But sometimes the development toward humor takes a long time with many steps.</p>

<p>This is obvious with a humor outcome like <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>—since we can't always support an argument in one sentence. That's because the person we’re talking with may:</p> 

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>disagree with us at first</li>
        <li>not understand the argument</li>
        <li>ask for clarification</li>
        <li>need more context</li>
        <li>give a counterpoint</li>
        <li>take time to think it over</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To push them into a humor outcome, we have to be aware of how their tripwire is guarded, and be responsive to them. It’s only after a shared development of the situation that they’ll feel we’ve <humor-outcome>supported our argument</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>It’s the same for all humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on. Sometimes, we reach these outcomes quickly—but other times, we have to develop the situation that way. </p>

<p>If we thought a humor attempt had to be successful or not from the first sentence, we’d be playing a game with the wrong rules—and we’d often struggle to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on: </p>

<p>Humor takes some situational assembly—and it’s often helpful to think of humor as the conclusion that we work toward, rather than beginning that starts something.</p>

     <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext">Since all humor outcomes are connected, a rising tide lifts all boats: improving at <humor-outcome>supporting arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on improves our skill at humor—and improving our skill at humor improves our <humor-outcome>ability to support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<div class="content-example">


    <p>We can use each humor outcomes as a method of generating humor. So if we ask: "How do I generate humor?" we can give ourselves an <sem>answer</sem> with a humor outcome:</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>“How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>”</li>
        <li>"How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>"</li>
        <li>"How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>helping someone become accepted</humor-outcome>"</li>
           </ul>   
      <p class="and-so-on">and so on</p> 
    
    <p>This downsizes an abstract question into something more specific—and we already have an idea on how to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>—and we can enroll these as part of our overall humor skill.</p>
    
    <p>So if we're writing a script and want some levity, instead of saying <callback>"what could this character say that would be funny?"</callback> we could instead say: <callback>"what could this character say to reveal a personal view?"</callback></p>
      
 <div class="vignette">

          <p>
              <narration>Yasmin always appreciated Jayne's character. He's one of those non-funny funny characters.</narration>

    <p>If we're around people and want to make them laugh, we can do the same thing. We can reconfigure the goal from <callback>"trying to be funny"</callback> to trying to reach humor outcomes like <callback>"trying to support an argument."</callback></p>
