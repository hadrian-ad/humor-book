    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">It often takes many steps before we feel humor</h1>
    
    
<p>Humor is something we develop a situation toward. This is how all humor happens, even though it’s sometimes a one-step process and sometimes a multi-step process:</p>

             <img src=../images/15c-images-humor-tripwires/15-6-it-ofsten-takes-many-steps-before-we-feel-humor/15-06-0-steps-to-humor.png

<p>In both cases above, humor takes <sem>time</sem>—it's something the situation develops toward. Humor never happens instantaneous, even though it sometimes happens very quickly. But sometimes the development toward humor takes a long time with many steps.</p>

<p>This is obvious with a humor outcome like support an argument—since we can't always support an argument in one sentence. That's because the person we’re talking with may:</p> 

    <ul>
       <li>disagree with us at first</li>
        <li>not understand the argument</li>
        <li>ask for clarification</li>
        <li>need more context</li>
        <li>give a counterpoint</li>
        <li>take time to think it over</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To push them into a humor outcome, we have to be aware of how their tripwire is guarded, and be responsive to them. It’s only after a shared development of the situation that they’ll feel we’ve <humor-outcome>supported our argument</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>It’s the same for all humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on. Sometimes, we reach these outcomes quickly—but other times, we have to develop the situation that way. </p>

<p>If we thought a humor attempt had to be successful or not from the first sentence, we’d be playing a game with the wrong rules—and we’d often struggle to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on: </p>

<p>Humor takes some situational assembly—and it’s often helpful to think of humor as the conclusion that we work toward, rather than beginning that starts something.</p>


<div class="box">
   <p>Since all humor outcomes are connected, a rising tide lifts all boats: improving at supporting arguments, revealing personal views, and so on improves our skill at humor—and improving our skill at humor improves our ability to support arguments, reveal personal views, and so on.</p>

    Methods (Framing)

<div class="content-example">


    <p>We can use humor outcomes as methods of generating humor. This lets everything become much more tangible and practical.</p> 
    
    <p>If we ask: "How do I generate humor?" we can give ourselves an <sem>answer</sem> with a humor outcome:</p> 
    
    <ul>
       <li>“How do I generate humor? By supporting an argument”</li>
        <li>"How do I generate humor? By revealing personal views"</li>
        <li>"How do I generate humor? By helping someone become accepted"</li>
           </ul>   
      <p class="and-so-on">and so on</p> 
    
    <p>This downsizes an abstract question into something more specific—and something we already have an idea about how to do. We already have an idea on how to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>—and we can enroll these as part of our overall humor skill.</p>
    
    <p>So if we're writing a script and want some levity, instead of saying <callback>"what could this character say that would be funny?"</callback> we could instead say: <callback>"what could this character say to reveal a personal view?"</callback></p>
      
 <div class="vignette"> 
          <p>
              <narration>Yasmin is re-watching Serenity.</narration>
          </p> 
          <p><speaker>Jayne:</speaker> <speech>"Captain's right."</speech> *loads gun* <speech>"Can't be thinking on revenge if we're gonna get through this."</speech></p> 
          <p><speaker>Zoë:</speaker> <internalaction>(with grim certitude)</internalaction> <speech>"Do you really think any of us is gonna get through this?"</speech></p>
          <p><speaker>Jayne:</speaker> <action>*looks around at people struggling to load their guns*</action> <internalaction>(hopefully)</internalaction> <speech>"Well, I might."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jayne reveals personal view, reveals personality trait)</notes></p>
          <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin feels Jayne revealed personal view, revealed personality trait)</notes></p> 
          <p>
              <narration>Yasmin always appreciated Jayne's character. He's one of those non-funny funny characters.</narration>

    <p>More importantly, if we're around people and want to make them laugh, instead of <callback>"trying to be funny"</callback> we can reconfigure our goal by trying to reach humor outcomes like <callback>"trying to support an argument."</callback></p>
      
      <p> <speaker>Amber:</speaker> <speech>"Cats are way better than dogs. They sit on your lap and shit in a box!"</speech>  </p>
      <p>
            <speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin feels Amber supported her argument)</notes> <speech>"You're just wrong!"</speech>
       </p>
 
       
    <p>This method of using humor outcomes sets questions about humor and humor-generation into managable framings.</p>
