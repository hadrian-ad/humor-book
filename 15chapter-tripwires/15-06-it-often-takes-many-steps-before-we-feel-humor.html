    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">It often takes many steps before we feel humor</h1>
    
    
<p>Humor is something we develop a situation toward. This is how all humor happens, even though it’s sometimes a one-step process and sometimes a multi-step process:</p>

<p>In both cases above, humor takes time—it's something the situation develops toward. It's never instantaneous, even though it sometimes happens very quickly. And other times, it takes a long, long while.</p>

 <p>This is obvious with a humor outcome like support an argument—since we don’t always support an argument in one sentence. That's because the person we’re talking with may:</p> 

    <ul>
       <li>disagree with us at first</li>
        <li>not understand the argument</li>
        <li>ask for clarification</li>
        <li>need more context</li>
        <li>give a counterpoint</li>
        <li>take time to think it over</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To push them into a humor outcome, we have to be aware of how their tripwire is guarded, and be responsive to them. It’s only after a shared development of the situation that they’ll feel we’ve supported our argument:</p>

<p>It’s the same for all humor outcomes, like easing tension, handling complaints, creating rapport, and so on. Sometimes, we reach these outcomes quickly—but other times, we have to develop the situation that way. </p>

<p>If we thought a humor attempt had to be successful or not from the first sentence, we’d be playing a game with the wrong rules—and we’d often struggle to support arguments, handle complains, create rapport, and so on: </p>

 

<p>Humor takes some situational assembly—and it’s often helpful to think of humor as the conclusion that we work toward, rather than beginning that starts something.</p>



<p>Methods. We can use humor outcomes as methods of generating humor. This lets everything become much more tangible and practical. (“How do I generate humor? By supporting an argument”—"How do I generate humor? By revealing personal views," and so on.)</p> 

<p>We know how to support arguments and reveal personal views—and we can enroll these as part of our overall humor skill. This means we already have many methods of generating humor!</p>

<p>Since these are connected, a rising tide lifts all boats: improving at supporting arguments, revealing personal views, and so on improves our skill at humor—and improving our skill at humor improves our ability to support arguments, reveal personal views, and so on.</p>
