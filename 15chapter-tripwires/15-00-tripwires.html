    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">15. Tripwires</h1>

<p>Last chapter, we saw that we can replace <i>“evaluating mistakes and OK as balancing”</i> with <a href="../14chapter-humor-outcomes/14-0-humor-outcomes.html">humor outcomes</a>&mdash;which lets us describe humor as <sem>actions</sem>.</p> 

<p>In this chapter, we’ll use a spatial metaphor to find practical ways of using humor outcomes.</p>

<p>We'll do this by thinking of humor outcomes as tripwires, and the situation like a ball. If the situational ball crosses a tripwire, it triggers humor:</p>

     >

      

<p>For instance, if Emma tries to evade Minh, she's pushing the situational ball toward the <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome> tripwire. If the situational ball successfully reaches that tripwire—if Emma avoids conflict—she feels humor:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma sees Minh down the hall. Uh-oh. She owes him coffee money, and he’s been hurt she hasn’t repaid him yet. Emma dodges down an alternate route before Minh sees her. Phew. Safe for another day! She laughs at herself.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma avoids conflict&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

     >
      
 

<p>We can see this with children too:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Riley is bored at the dinner table.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Sam makes a funny face at her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam pushes Riley toward the tripwire of change negative emotions into positive ones)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Riley giggles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Riley trips the wire&harr;&#xFE0E;negative emotions changed into positive ones&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
    
     </div>

    title="";
    style="max-width: 27rem ; margin-left: 1rem" 
     >
      

<p>Since we’re not the only influence on the situation, we may push for a tripwire but not reach it for one reason or another:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma sees Minh down the hall. Uh-oh. She owes him some money, and he’s been hurt she hasn’t repaid him yet. Emma tries to dodges down an alternate route before Minh sees her, but he mournfully catches her eye as she goes out of view. She’s obviously avoiding him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Well, fuck.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t avoid conflict&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes></p>
    
     </div>

    <p><narration>Sam makes a funny face at her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam pushes Riley toward the tripwire of change negative emotions into positive ones)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Riley pouts and squirms.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Riley pushes herself away from the tripwire&harr;&#xFE0E;negative emotions are not changed into positive ones&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes></p>
     </div>

<p>When Riley squirms to avoid feeling humor, the situation hasn't yet reached an outcome—since Sam can continue to put pressure toward the tripwire with another funny face.</p> 
 
<p>At that point, Riley can then fully close the situation by resisting utterly—screaming or throwing a tantrum—or she can let the pressure push her across a humor outcome tripwire:</p>

<p>Throughout this chapter, we’ll use tripwires as a notational metaphor to think about when and why humor happens.</p>
