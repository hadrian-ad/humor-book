    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">15. Tripwires</h1>

Last chapter, we saw that we can replace “evaluating mistakes and OK as balancing” with humor outcomes. This lets us describe humor as actions, using ordinary language. 

 

In this chapter, we’ll use humor outcomes to find practical methods of understanding or generating humor.

This involves a spatial metaphor: we’ll think of humor outcomes as tripwires, and the situation like a ball. If the situational ball crosses a tripwire, it sets off humor:

 

For instance, by trying to evade Minh, Emma pushes the situational ball towards the avoid conflict tripwire. If the situational ball successfully reaches that tripwire—if Emma avoids conflict—she feels humor:

 

Emma sees Minh down the hall. Uh-oh. She owes him coffee money, and he’s been hurt she hasn’t repaid him yet. Emma dodges down an alternate route before Minh sees her. Phew. Safe for another day! She laughs at herself. (<- Emma avoids conflict <-> humor)

 


 

We can see this with children too:

 

Riley is bored at the dinner table.

Sam makes a funny face at her. (<- Sam pushes Riley toward the tripwire of change negative emotions into positive ones)

Riley giggles. (<- Riley trips the wire <-> negative emotions changed into positive ones <-> humor)

 


Since we’re not the only influence on the situation, we may push for a tripwire but not reach it:


Emma sees Minh down the hall. Uh-oh. She owes him some money, and he’s been hurt she hasn’t repaid him yet. Emma tries to dodges down an alternate route before Minh sees her, but he mournfully catches her eye as she goes out of view. She’s obviously avoiding him.

Emma: (annoyed) “Well, fuck.” (<- Emma doesn’t avoid conflict <-> no humor)

 


Riley is bored at the dinner table.

Sam makes a funny face at her. (<- Sam pushes Riley toward the tripwire of change negative emotions into positive ones)

Riley pouts and squirms. (<- Riley pushes herself away from the tripwire <-> negative emotions are not changed into positive ones <-> no humor) 

When Riley squirms to avoid feeling humor, she hasn’t yet closed the situation—since Sam can continue to put pressure toward the tripwire with another funny face. Riley can then fully close the situation by resisting utterly—screaming or throwing a tantrum—or she can let the pressure push her across a humor outcome tripwire:

 


Throughout this chapter, we’ll use tripwires as a notational metaphor to think about when and why humor happens.
