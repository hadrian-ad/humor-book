    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">2. Humor is an emotion</h1>
    
    
<p>We can generate humor without even thinking about “humor.” We do this by thinking about a humor outcome instead.</p> 

<p>For instance, instead of humor, Sam can think about symbolizing close ties—and then try to reach that outcome without thinking about humor at all:</p>

 

<p>Sam: “I love you.” (&larr;Sam tries to symbolize close ties)</p>

<p>Jennifer: *smiles* (&larr;Jennifer feels Sam has symbolized close ties&harr;&#xFE0E;humor) “I love you too!”</p>

 

<p>Jennifer is about to head out to the grocery store.</p>

<p>Sam: *gets up* “You know what. I’ll come with you!”</p>

<p>Jennifer: “Oh, you don’t have to.”</p>

<p>Sam: *smiling* “Well I want to.” (&larr;Sam tries to symbolize close ties)</p>

<p>Jennifer: *smiles* (&larr;Jennifer feels Sam has symbolized close ties&harr;&#xFE0E;humor) *puts on coat*</p>

 

<p>Sam: “Remember when we went to Chicago?” (&larr;Sam tries to symbolize close ties)</p>

<p>Jennifer: *smiles* “What made you think of that?” (&larr;Jennifer feels Sam has symbolized close ties&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p> 

<p>Sam generates humor in Jennifer—he helps her feel acceptance, connection, comfort, and so on. To do this, he doesn’t need funny voices, jokes, puns, silly dances, or so on—instead, he just focuses on symbolizing close ties. If he successfully reaches this outcome, he generates humor.</p> 

<p>Similarly, Jessica can make customers laugh without involving anything she usually associates with humor. Instead, she just focuses on reaching a humor outcome:</p>

 

<p>Jessica: *to a customer* *setting down condiments* “Oh, I love your style!” (&larr;Jessica goes straight toward humor outcome tripwires)</p>

<p>Yasmin: *turns red* *brightens* *beams* “Oh. Thanks!” (&larr;Yasmin feels Jessica’s revealed a personal view, changed her negative emotions into positive ones, supported an argument, created rapport)</p>


<p>Jessica didn't need a joke to make Yasmin feel humor. She instead used a compliment to push her directly toward humor outcomes.</p>

<p>We often have stereotypes about what generates humor. When we realize we're not bound to these stereotypes, and can instead generate humor by focusing on humor outcomes directly, we broaden our methods for generating humor.</p>

 
<p>Methods. Jessica can make customers laugh by pushing them into humor outcomes. She has two ways of going about this. This first is to focus on the topic, and then match it to a humor outcomes—the second is the think about humor outcomes, and then match it to a topic.</p> 

    <ul>
       <li>Jessica could first pick a topic, like 'Yasmin's style.' Then, she thinks about what she can say about this specific topic that would create rapport, reveal my personal view, open a new topic of conversation, symbolize ties, and so on. ("Oh, I love your style!")</li>
        
        <li>Jessica could first pick a humor outcome, like reveal a personal view. She then thinks about what topic she could reveal a personal view on. This may be Yasmin's style, her opinion of football, what she thinks of the weather, or so on.</li>
        </ul> 

<p>If Jessica does either method successfully (reaches a humor outcome), she’ll generate humor—without giving any thought about how this relates to jokes or other comedy-dominated connotations we sometimes have with humor. </p>
