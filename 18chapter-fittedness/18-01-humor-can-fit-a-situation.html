<h2 id="exclude-navigation">Humor can fit a situation</h2>
    
   

<p>In this book, we'll avoid the word “appropriate”&mdash;we'll use the word <vocab>fit</vocab> instead.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This lets us change our question from <callback>“when is humor appropriate?”</callback> into <callback>“when does humor fit?”</callback></p> 
    </div>
    
<p>We already use "fittedness" all the time&mdash;if we walk around our yard to see where a vegetable garden could go, we’d notice reasons a garden would fit in some parts of our yard better than others, like:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>access to water sources</li>
    <li>elevation</li>
    <li>closeness to the house</li>
    <li>protection from wind</li>
    <li>qualities of soil</li>
    <li>sunlight</li>
    <li>what we want to grow</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>We’d add up these factors to measure degrees of fittedness: </p>

    alt="This image introduces intergration figures. There are two. The first has the words 'sunlight' and 'close to house' which are connected by a line to a circle. The second has even more lines, connecting the previous two as well as 'protected from wind,' 'access to hose,' and 'good elevation. Visually, the second has more links. Annotation to the first figure says 'garden spot fits less' and to the second'  garden spot fits more.'";

<p>This is easy to do for <term>gardens</term>, since we already have ideas about what contributes to garden-fittedness, like sunlight and water. But we can do the same thing with <term2>humor</term2> too!</p> 

<p>We can find degrees of fittedness in humor or humor attempts by using topics, intensity, humor family words, humor tells, humor outcomes, and so on:</p> 

     <img src=../images/18c-images-fittedness/18-01-humor-can-fit-a-situation/18-01-1-humor.png

    alt="Similar to the previous figure, there are two integration figures. The first has 'realization' and 'ease tensions' with lines connected to a circle. The second has the previous two and also 'connection,' create rapport,' and 'acceptably criticize.' The second visually has more connection to its circle. Annotations say the humor attempt fits more in the second than the first.";

    <p><headline>Morality.</headline> In this chapter, we'll be looking at how people <term>do</term> react to humor, not how other people think people <term2>should</term2> react to humor. That means we aren't talking about morality or etiquette as such. <callback>("Should.")</callback></p>  
    
    <p>To avoid the association the word "appropriate" sometimes has with morality or etiquette <callback>(“It’s inappropriate to chew with your mouth open.”)</callback>, we'll be using the more neutral, observational word "fittedness" instead.</p> 
    
    <p>If we scatter seeds across a yard, some seeds will take better in some parts of the yard than others. It’s not that some seeds had better morality or etiquette than other seeds <callback>(“appropriateness”)</callback>&mdash;instead, some seeds do better because the conditions were just better for those particular seeds than others <callback>(“fittedness”)</callback>. We can do something similar with humor.</p>
