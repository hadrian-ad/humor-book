    <p>When something is more fitted, that doesn't mean it's the best option, funniest, most important, or so on&mdash;it just means its most fitted.</p>

<aside class="box">
    
    <p><headline>Focus.</headline> It's the same process to find the fittedness of humor <callback>(an emotion)</callback> as it is to find the fittedness of a <a href="../15chapter-z-velocity/15-11-humor-attempts.html">humor attempt</a> <callback>(an action)</callback>.</p>  
    
    <p>Even if Hana never smiles in any of the examples above <callback>(humor attempts without humor)</callback>, we could still organize the humor attempts by fittedness.</p>
    
    <p>Similarly, even if Hana smiles at Artem without Artem knowing she's there <callback>(humor without humor attempts)</callback>, we could still organize her humor by fittedness&mdash;it's more fitted if she smiles because she recognizes him than because she thinks about cake.</p>
