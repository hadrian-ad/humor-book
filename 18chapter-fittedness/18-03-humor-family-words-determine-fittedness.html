    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor family words determine fittedness</h1>
    
<p>Topics are just one component of fittedness. We can also use <a href="../7chapter-humor-family-words/7-0-humor-family-words.html">humor family words</a> to think about the fittededness of humor attempts.</p>

 

<div class="listbox">
   <p class="listbox-headline">Humor family words</p>
   <p><i>acceptance, accomplishment, apology, appreciation, belonging, comfort, connection, delight, forgiveness, generosity, humor, insight, joy, reconciliation, realization, release, revelation, relief, safety, success, surprise, welcome</i></p></div>

    <p>Humor family words let us break questions about fittedness into more managable chunks.</p> 
    
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
         <p class="for-instance-text">Instead of the very broad question of <callback>“when does <emotions>humor</emotions> fit”</callback>, we can decompose it into more answerable questions&mdash;like <callback>“when would <emotions>acceptance</emotions> fit?”</callback> or <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, or so on.</p> 
        </div> 
        
<p>Below, Emma feels sadness&mdash;and after Zoe hugs her she feels humor and sadness at the same time. </p>
        
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*red-eyed*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“What’s wrong, Em?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Nothing. I’ve just realized I’m older now than my brother was when h-he died…”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Aw. Emma.”</speech> <action>*hugs*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*cries*</action> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma has mixed emotional states with both <emotions-in-notes>sadness</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p> 
    </div>
    
<p>We can use topics <sem-weak>and</sem-weak> humor family words to estimate the fittedness:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li><strong>Relevancy of topics.</strong> The humor is generated on relevant or recently active topics—since Emma had been thinking about her brother, and Zoe gave Emma a hug in response.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Relevance of humor family words.</strong> We can cleanly describe Emma’s humor as related to experiences of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on.</li>
    </ul>

    alt="This integration figure expands on the previous ones by having not just topics, but humor family words like reconciliation, acceptance, release, comfort, and so on. These are all connected to the small circle, which has an arrow to an emotional state box which has a little section of humor in it.";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 40rem; margin-left: "

    <p>Emma's humor fit the situation&mdash;so did Zoe's humor attempt.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We don’t usually think of hugs as humor attempts. But since Zoe was <sem-weak>intending</sem-weak> Emma to feel humor <callback>(<emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, and so on)</callback>, her hug was part of a humor attempt.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Not only was it a successful humor attempt, it was a <sem-weak>fitted</sem-weak> one too too&mdash;since it involved relevant topics and was intending Emma to feel humor family words.</p>
    </div>

<p>If Zoe just randomly hugs Emma out of the blue, her humor attempt would be less fitted. Even though Zoe would still be intending Emma to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, and so on—it wouldn't involve the same relevant or recently active topics.</p> 

<p>If Zoe randomly hugs a <sem-weak>stranger</sem-weak>, her humor attempt would be even less fitted. The topics involved would have even less relevance&mdash;and there would be less context to describe the intention as <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, and so on.</p>

 

 

<div class="box">
     <p><headline>Coexistence.</headline> Sometimes we think of humor as the opposite of sadness, in the sense that they can’t exist together&mdash;but humor isn’t really the opposite of sadness. And even if they were, there's no reason why they can't be present simultaneously.</p>
      
    <p>For the same reason there's nothing preventing us from having a black and white painting, there's nothing preventing sadness and humor from being present simultaneously.</p> 
    
    
    <!--
    <p>Each topic generates an emotion into our emotional state. Since we can have many topics active at once, there’s nothing particularly unusual about feeling humor and sadness simultaneously&mdash;or alternating between balanced emotions and mistake-predominant emotions.</p>
