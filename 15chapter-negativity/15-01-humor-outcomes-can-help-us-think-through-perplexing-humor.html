Humor outcomes describe motivation
</h1>


<p>To make sense of perplexing situations involving humor, we can avoid thinking about "humor"&mdash;and think about humor outcomes instead:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*hands on hips*</action> <speech>“Xiaowei, when are you going to start looking for a job?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <action>*playing a game*</action> <internalaction>(listlessly)</internalaction> “When my shit turns blue.”</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*throws hands up*</action> <notes>(&larr;Heather feels Xiaowei is being flippant)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;mistakes and OKs balance&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
<p>Why did Xiaowei laugh? We might say he:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li><humor-outcome>avoided conflict (about how he was spending time)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>handled a complaint (by shutting down a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>revealed a personal view (that he doesn’t want to get a job)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>supported an argument (that this isn’t a good time for a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>eased tensions (with himself)</humor-outcome></li>
    <li><humor-outcome>controlled a situation (by ending a conversation)</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Xiaowei laughed because he purposefully reached or stumbled into humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>avoiding conflict</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>controlling a situation</humor-outcome>. This puts his behavior into an understandable framing.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Describing Xiaowei’s humor with humor outcomes doesn’t mean he was effective; did something well; that others shouldn’t describe him as rude; or so on.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Instead, we’re trying to avoid what can sometimes be our first impression: that he was being erratic; that his behavior was inscrutable; that humor is fundamentally inexplicable; or so on.</p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>Heather <outcome-contrast>didn’t</outcome-contrast> feel humor, because she didn't feel Xiaowei <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>&mdash;she felt Xiaowei <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>created</outcome-contrast> conflict</humor-outcome>.</p>


<!--
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">To work through this situation, we follow an order of operations. First, we sort out who felt humor, and when. We’ll see that <term>Heather</term> didn’t feel humor at all. But <em>Xiaowei</em> did—<sem>after</sem> Heather threw up her hands.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Then, at this point—where there’s humor—we can see if any humor outcomes seem to clearly describe the situation.</p> </div>
-->

 

<div class="box"> 
     
     <p><headline>Topics and humor outcomes.</headline> Humor outcomes describe something happening to a <sem>specific topic</sem>. So we don't <humor-outcome>achieve catharsis</humor-outcome> on everything all at once when we laugh&mdash;instead, just the topic that generates humor <humor-outcome>achieves catharsis</humor-outcome>.</p>
 
     <p>We can choose between different humor outcomes depending on the topic that generates humor. When Heather and Xiaowei have a conversation about a job, some of his active topics might be: </p>
     
     <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
        <li>‘Heather’s reaction’</li>
         
         <li>‘this conversation’</li>
         
         <li>‘Xiaowei’s overall life’</li>
         
         </ul>
     
     <p>If we intuitively feel Xiaowei felt he <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome>handled a complaint</humor-outcome>, we can loosely correspond each one to their most contextually relevant topic:</p>
     
      
     <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
         <li>‘Heather’s reaction’&rarr;<notes>Xiaowei feels he <humor-outcome>avoided conflict (with his mother)</humor-outcome></notes></li>
         
         <li>‘this conversation’<notes>&rarr;Xiaowei feels he <humor-outcome>controlled the situation (the conversation)</humor-outcome></notes></li>
         
         <li>‘Xiaowei’s overall life’&rarr;<notes>Xiaowei feels he <humor-outcome>handled a complaint (about his life)</humor-outcome></notes></li>
         
         </ul> 
     
     </div>

 

  <!--
 [add to chapter on explanation vs description]
      <p> In the absence of an explanation, we might rely on explanation-substitute words—like that his humor was:</p> 


<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li>destructive</li>
    
    <li>discourteous</li>
    
    <li>disrespectful</li>
    
    <li>counter-productive</li>
    
    <li>facetious</li>
    
    <li>flippant</li>
    
    <li>immature</li>
    
    <li>impolite</li>
    
    <li>inappropriate</li>
    
    <li>inopportune</li>
    
    <li>irreverent</li>
    
    <li>needling</li>
    
    <li>out-of-line</li>
    
    <li>senseless</li>
    
    <li>rude</li>
    
    <li>tasteless</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Setting aside whether those words have <term>descriptive</term> merit, they don't really have <em>explanatory</em> merit&mdash;since those words characterize tone, not motivation or purpose.</p>

    <p>What does it mean to say Dave and Karen <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective here</humor-outcome>? Since specific topics generate humor, it's specific topics that felt humor <callback>(mistakes and OKs balance)</callback>&mdash;so specific topics reach humor outcomes. That means a <outcome-contrast>specific topic</outcome-contrast> <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>.</p>
    
    
     <p>So when Dave and Karen <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> at the poster about intellectual property, they didn't gain a new perspective about <sem>everything</sem>. It might not even be about the broad topic 'intellectual property.' Instead, we can try fitting the humor outcome to more specific topics.</p>
     
     <p>
      It might be that Dave and Karen <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome> on 'intellectual property,' but just as likely on more granular topics like 'Buddhism,' 'English language,' 'translations,' 'standards of discussion,' 'Thailand,' 'this trip,' or so on. This helps us be more grounded in how we understand and use humor outcomes.
