Humor isn't itself a negative experience 
</h2>


<p>Sometimes we think humor outcomes can be negative, since humor can be present during negative experiences of belittling, dehumanizing, and so on.</p>

<p>But if people are feeling <term>shame</term>, they're feeling <term>shame</term>&mdash;<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> humor. People who are feeling <term2>belittled</term2> are feeling <term2>belittled</term2>&mdash;<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> humor:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor comes into class and slips and falls, his cereal cup falling down his shirt. The entire class is at first shocked, but when they see he’s not hurt, start laughing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;class feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> </p>
    
    <p><narration>Bitter and unamused, Trevor stalks away to the bathroom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels <emotions-in-notes>shame</emotions-in-notes>, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p> 
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma sees Owen selling candy in the hallway.</narration></p> 
    
    <p>Emma: <speech>“You’re selling candy?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> “What are you, a girl scout?”</p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen’s face burns.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen feels <emotions-in-notes>shame</emotions-in-notes>, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>

<div class="vignette">    
        <p><narration>Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table and they look at him and laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Emma feel <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speech>“Nice hat, man!”</speech> <narration>Emma says, admiringly. But Owen is horrified that they had laughed.</narration> <speech>“Thanks,”</speech> <narration>he says, tingling with horror.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen feels <emotions-in-notes>shame</emotions-in-notes>, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
        
        </div> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Middle school Emma is talking to Heather, her favorite teacher, when a passing student makes a witty comment about Emma’s buzzed head. Heather laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Heather feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Emma feels weirdly crushed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels <emotions-in-notes>shame</emotions-in-notes>, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>When Heather laughs at the comment about Emma’s hair, Heather <humor-outcome>eased tension (with herself)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport (with the mocking student)</humor-outcome>, felt <humor-outcome>the student revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on. Heather feels humor.</p> 

<p>But while <term>Heather</term> feels humor, <term2>Emma</term2> <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> feel humor&mdash;and so <term2>Emma</term2> <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> experience any humor outcomes.</p> 

<p>Instead, since Emma felt mistake-predominant emotions, she felt mistake-predominant outcomes:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>instead of <humor-outcome>reduced defensiveness</humor-outcome>, Emma felt <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>increased</outcome-contrast> defensiveness</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>instead of being <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, Emma felt she was <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>instead of <humor-outcome>negative emotions turned into positive ones</humor-outcome>, Emma felt <humor-outcome>negative emotions <outcome-contrast>stay</outcome-contrast> negative</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Even though <term>Heather's</term> humor has bad outcomes for <term>Emma</term>&mdash;we can still describe <term2>Heather's</term2> humor in terms of “good” emotional outcomes for <term2>Heather</term2>.</p> 

<p>In this way, humor can be described positively for whoever is <sem-weak>feeling</sem-weak> humor&mdash;even at the same time the situation can be described negatively overall.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Even in more severe situations, humor isn't a negative emotion. If if a group of kids circle around another kid and laugh as they push and mock them, <term>harassers</term> are feeling humor, which can be described as positive humor outcomes for the <term>harassers</term>.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">But the <term2>target</term2> or <term2>observers</term2> of the harassment aren’t <term2>themselves</term2> feeling humor.</p>

    </div>
 

 
<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Tracking.</headline> We sometimes notice people who are careless about tracking humor, like when someone says <callback>“everyone laughed”</callback> in a group, even though some people weren’t feeling humor.</p>
    
    <p>We wouldn’t do this for speech! If many people said yes and a few said no, no one present would say <em>everyone</em> said yes&mdash;or mix-up who said yes with who said no.</p> 
    
    <p>But even though we are almost never this imprecise for speech, we are sometimes imprecise for emotions. This is often avoidable carelessness&mdash;since we're capable of applying the same care to <term>emotions</term> that we already do for <term2>speech</term2>.</p>
