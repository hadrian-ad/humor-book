	 Another humor family word is <emotions>safety</emotions>—when we feel <emotions>safety</emotions>, we’re feeling humor:

		<narration>Trevor is talking the dog out at night. As General Zod squats to pee, Trevor looks into the nearby patch of dark trees, and a deep fear comes over him. He starts to jog back to the house with the dog until he feels possessed by terror and sprints the final way.</narration>
</p>
<p>
		<narration>He races inside, locks the door, and breathes a sigh of relief. “Phew. We made it, Zod. Safe!” He laughs as the dog wags its tail.</narration> <notes>(&larr;safety&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>

	Above, Trevor feels humor—he evaluates a mistake as OK. In context, we can describe this humor as <emotions>safety</emotions>—which describes humor around close calls, pressing deadlines, high-risk gambles, physical danger, or so on. 
</p>
<p>
	These things sometimes cause us to feel mistake-predominant emotions, like fear. But when these mistakes are eventually matched by an OK, we've moved from fear to safety—we feel humor:

	When Justin gets up, he and Heather giggle with “relief.”
	
		 <emotions>Relief</emotions>
	
	 is another humor family word. Since
	
		<emotions>relief</emotions>
	
	 and
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>
	
	 are context-specific variations of the word humor, both are fine to use simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
	Humor family words overlap because they’re describing the same thing: <emotions>humor</emotions>. This is why it usually feels accurate to use more than one humor family word to describe the same emotional experience:

<p><headline>Merging and overlap.</headline> When Zoe returns to a warm apartment on a rainy day and smiles, we can describe her emotions as <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. The reason these humor family words overlap with each other is because they're describing the same emotional experience—<emotions>humor</emotions>:</p>

		<p>	We don't have to struggle to pick just one humor family word—since words like <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on merge into and redescribe each other. We can use as many of them at once as we feel is useful.</p>
