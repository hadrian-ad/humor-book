	As before, we feel humor because of mistakes and OKs. When Jennifer’s at the resort, the furnishing and situation is a mistake—they deviate from what she's come to expect from furnishing and situations. She eventually feels secure from negative personal consequences from that mistake—so she giggles and feels humor.
