	As before, we feel humor because mistakes and OKs balance.</p> 
	
	<p>When Jennifer’s at the resort, the furnishing and situation deviate from what she's come to expect from furnishing and situations <callback>(a mistake)</callback>. At first she doesn't know how to relate to it, but eventually she leans into the experience <callback>(it's OK)</callback>. 
	
	<p>As her mistake and OK balance, she laughs and feels and feels humor.
