	Since at first it can seem odd to think of humor family words <sem>as</sem> humor, we'll go through some of our humor family words one-by-one.</p> 
	
	<p>We'll see that these words are all humor—all moments where we evaluate mistakes as OK:

	<narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title. <i>“Wherever You Go, There You Are.”</i> She thinks about that for a second, puzzled.</narration></p> 
	
	<p><narration>Then something clicks. She laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;realization&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> 
</p>
</div>
<p>
	Zoe laughs after reading a book title: her mistakes and OKs shift in a way that generates humor. In context, we can describe this specific instance of humor as
	<emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on. These are all different words that describe the same thing: humor.

    <p class="considertext">We used the word

        <emotions>reinterpretation</emotions>, <emotions>self-discovery</emotions>, <emotions>transformation</emotions>,
        and so on—all of which describe moments of humor.</p>
