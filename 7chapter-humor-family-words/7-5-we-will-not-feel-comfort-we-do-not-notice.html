We won’t feel comfort we don’t notice

<p>
    We feel humor when we feel <emotions>comfort</emotions>. But if we’re not aware that we’re feeling <emotions>comfort</emotions>, we won’t feel humor:

<p>
	When Riley first jumps on the couch, she may have felt <emotions>comfort</emotions>. But over time, the experience of being on the sofa accrues perceptual camouflage, and she stops feeling
	
		<emotions>comfort</emotions>.
	
</p>
<p>
	It won’t be until something changes—like she gets off the sofa or changes position—that she’s likely to notice things again. 
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">
        
            Consider:
        
    </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        When Riley first jumps on the sofa, she has an active topic where a mistake is evaluated as OK—she feels
        
            <emotions>comfort.</emotions>
        
        But eventually, she acclimates to the mistake, and the topic stops generating humor. Eventually, the topic becomes inactive, and so
        
            <em>can't</em>
        
        generate humor. 
    </p>
    
        <img class="img-indent"
        src="../images/7c-images-humor-family-words/7-5-we-will-not-feel-comfort-we-don't-notice/7-5-0-topics.png"
        title=""
        alt=""
        style="max-width:23rem;">
    
    <p class="considertext">
        At that point, Riley isn't evaluating this topic for the same reason she's not evaluating topics related to her being safe, short, young, Pennsylvanian, able to run, or the fact that she could one day walk on Mars. Even though those are all true, she simply has no reason to be evaluating these things—those topics are dormant or uncreated. 
    </p>
</div>
<p>
	This is also why Riley will easily feel
	
		comfort
	
	when she goes to a friend’s house. Nothing there has perceptual camouflage, so she’ll experience everything vividly.

    <div class="contentBOX">
            <p>The things we come to expect accrue perceptual camouflage. This happens with our <em>senses</em>,
                        
                        like how we eventually stop hearing the sounds from the nearby highway—but it also happens with our <em>emotions</em>
                        
                        too.</p>
	<p>
		We stop noticing our emotional state when it becomes expected, the way things just are. This is like when we're:
	</p>
	<ul class="close-list">
		<li>
			stressed for an entire year and not really be aware of it—until something changes in our emotional state.
		</li>
		<li>
			employed for horrible work that we despise at first—but soon become numb to it.
		</li>
		<li>
			sad for so long that we don't notice—until we start suddenly crying.
		</li>
		<li>
			having a powerful emotional experience in a new hobby to be a powerful emotional experience—until it soon feels like everything else we do on a weekly basis.
		</li>
		<li>
			angry all the time—until it eventually just seems the normal way we are
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<i>(and so on)</i>
		
		 
	</p>
	<p>
		It's harder to reflect on our emotional state when it's been consistent for a long while—which is what happened on a smaller scale with Riley, where the same amount of comfort slowly lead to less and less <emotions>comfort</emotions> over time.
