Humor marks a sense of <emotions>achievement</emotions>
</h2>
  
<p>
	An "objective" achievement and an emotion of <emotions>achievement</emotions> are different things:

           <p>We can use humor to identify who is and isn’t feeling <emotions>achievement</emotions>.</p>

	An "objective achievement" and an "emotion of achievement" are different things. They sometimes overlap, but don't always:

	This is why <term>failure</term> sometimes makes people sometimes feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>, and <term2>success</term2> sometimes <outcome-contrast>doesn't</outcome-contrast> make people feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>:
