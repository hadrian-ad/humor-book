Humor marks a sense of <emotions>achievement</emotions>
</h1>
  
<p>
	An "objective" achievement and an emotion of <emotions>achievement</emotions> are different things:

       <p class="considertext">We can use humor to identify who is and isn’t feeling <emotions>achievement</emotions>.

Humor helps us track how people are experiencing things around them.</p>

<p>
	An "objective achievement" and an "emotion of achievement" are different things. They sometimes overlap, but don't always:

	This is true for all our humor family words—like how people may feel <emotions>realization</emotions>
	when we think they "shouldn't" feel <emotions>realization</emotions>. <callback>("How did you not know that?")</callback> 
</p>

    <div class="box">
		<p><headline>Perspective and achievement.</headline> We can use mistakes and OKs to think about why someone does or doesn't feel achievement at a track meet.</p>
	
		<p>When Zoe gets third place, her mistake is larger than her OK. She had expected to do better <callback>(large mistake)</callback>, and felt that this had negative personal consequences to how she or others saw her <callback>(small OK)</callback>.</p>
	<p>
		But someone who gets fourth place in that contest may feel achievement <callback>(feel humor)</callback> if they did better than they expected
		<callback>(large mistake)</callback> <sem>and</sem> felt that this didn't have much risk of negative personal consequences <callback>(large OK)</callback>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is why someone with a worse result	<callback>(fourth place)</callback> can feel more
		<emotions>achievement</emotions> than someone with a better result <callback>(third place)</callback>. We can use mistakes and OKs to think about this, because humor and achievement refer to the same emotion.
