Humor shows when someone feels achievement
</h1>
  
<p>
	An objective achievement and an emotion of achievement are different things. 
</p>

<div class="vignette">

	<narration>Zoe gets third place in her track meet. Emma congratulates her, grinning.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <narration>But Zoe feels disappointed. She gives a weak smile and puts her hands on her hips, frustrated.</narration> <notes>(&larr; Zoe doesn’t feel achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes>
</p>
    </div>
<p>
	Emma thinks getting third is an objective achievement. But that doesn’t mean Zoe will subjectively experience it as <emotions>achievement.</emotions>

        </p>
       <p class="considertext">We can use humor to identify who is and isn’t feeling <emotions>achievement</emotions>. When Zoe got third place, it was <em>Emma</em> who felt achievement <callback>(feels humor)</callback>, and Zoe who doesn’t feel achievement <callback>(doesn't feel humor)</callback>. Humor helps us track how people are experiencing things around them.</p>

<p>
	An "objective achievement" and an "emotion of achievement" are different things. They sometimes overlap, but don't always:

<p>
	This is why we people sometimes <em>do</em> feel <emotions>achievement</emotions> at failure, or <em>don't</em> feel <emotions>achievement</emotions> at success:

	This is true for all our humor family words—like how people may feel <emotions>realization</emotions>

		<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to think about why someone does or doesn't feel achievement at a track meet.</p>
	
		<p>When Zoe gets third place, her mistake is larger than her OK. She had expected to do better <callback>(her result deviated from her expectation)</callback>, and felt that this had negative consequences to her efforts or how she saw herself <callback>(she didn't feel secure from negative personal consequences)</callback>.</p>
	<p>
		But someone who gets fourth place in that contest may feel achievement <callback>(feel humor)</callback>—if they did better than they expected
		<callback>(result deviated from their expectation)</callback>, and felt that this was without any downside <callback>(they felt secure from negative personal consequences)</callback>.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is why someone with a worse result	<callback>(fourth place)</callback> can feel more
		<callback>achievement</callback> than someone with a better result <callback>(third place)</callback>. We can use mistakes and OKs to think about this—because humor is the emotion people feel when they feel achievement.
