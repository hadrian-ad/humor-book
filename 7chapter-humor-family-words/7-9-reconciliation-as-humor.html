<p>
	When we’re apologizing, it’s often hard to pay attention for this humor. We’re often intensely focused on other things—but once it’s pointed out, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> is a familiar instance of humor.
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">
        
            Consider:
        
    </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        To successfully reconcile with someone, we <em>both</em> need to feel humor—but more specifically, feel humor on relevant topics. Owen can’t just make Emma laugh by imitating a professor and calling that shared humor <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>.
    </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        Instead, Owen and Emma have to activate <em>specific</em> topics around their characterization of each other, and then feel humor on those specific topics. This gives their humor the integration to the situation that lets us call it <emotion>reconciliation</emotion>.

			<p>Jokes are often emotionally straightforward compared to apologies. Reading a random joke from a jokebook might involve a few random topics—but an apology may involve <em>many</em> relevant topics:</p>

	<p>
		We sometimes lose track of humor in complicated emotional states, since the humor is in a soup of other emotions—but the more attention we pay toward the humor in these moments, the less effort it will take to register it.
