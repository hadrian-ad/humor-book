    title="Reconciliation involves humor"
    alt="In this comparison of two evaluation graphs, moment A marks Owen's apology. In the first graph, it leads to the mistake and OK balancing, leading to reconciliation. In the other graph, the apology doesn't bring the mistake and OK into balance."

<p>
	When we’re apologizing, it’s often hard to pay attention for this humor. We’re often intensely focused on other things—but once it’s pointed out, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> is a familiar instance of humor.
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">
        
            Consider:
        
    </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        To successfully reconcile with someone, we <term>both</term> need to feel humor—but more specifically, feel humor on <em>relevant</em> topics. Owen can’t just make Emma laugh by imitating a professor and calling that shared humor <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>.
    </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        Instead, Owen and Emma have to activate <sem>specific</sem> topics related to the interpersonal rupture, and then feel humor on those specific topics. This gives their humor the situational integration that lets us call it <emotion>reconciliation</emotion>.
    </p>
</div>
    
    <div class="box">
			<p><headline>Emotional straightforwardness.</headline> Jokes are often emotionally straightforward compared to apologies. Reading a random joke from a jokebook might involve a few random topics—but an apology may involve <sem>many</sem> relevant topics:</p>

    title="We don't always recognize humor in complicated emotional states"
    alt="This image compares two emotional state boxes. The first emotion box says 'emotional state after jokebook joke.' There are two topics that feed in humor with some disgust. An annotation says 'humor is easier to notice in a straightforward emotional state.' Next to it is another emotional state box, labeled 'emotional state after acceptance or apology.' There are four topics generating humor, sadness, regret, and embarassment into the box, creating a more complicate emotional state. An annotation says 'humor is harder to notice in a complex emotional state."
    style="max-width:37rem;">

	<p>
		We sometimes lose track of humor in complicated emotional states. But as we learn to look for it, it becomes easier and easier to register humor in these situations.
