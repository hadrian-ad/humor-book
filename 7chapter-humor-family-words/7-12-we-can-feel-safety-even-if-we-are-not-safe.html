We can feel <emotions>safety</emotions> even if we’re not safe
</h2>

<p>
	Like any of our humor family words, we don’t always feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions> when we're "technically" safe&mdash;just like we <em>can</em> feel <emotions>safety</emotions> even when we’re <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> technically safe: 
</p>

    
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        
            <narration>Brad watches a sensationalized internet video about members of a drug trafficking organization.</narration>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        
            <narration>Xiaowei and Lina are lighting rags on fire and throwing them around the shed. At first, Lina was stressed out by this&mdash;but pretty soon she realizes it’s fun, and they laugh as they try to melt things.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>safety</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>

<p>
	Even if Brad is statistically one of the safest, securest people on the planet, if he evaluates mistakes as not OK, he won’t feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>. 
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, it doesn’t matter if playing with fire in uncontrolled environments has real risk of personal negative consequences&mdash;if Xiaowei and Lina evaluate the personal risk as balanced with the mistake, they’ll feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>.
	
</p>
<p>
	Humor marks a temporary arrangement of our evaluations&mdash;which doesn’t mean those evaluations are somehow “right.” Sometimes objective safety and a feeling of safety overlap&mdash;but not always:

    title="There are two overlapping but distinct meanings to safety"
    alt="This venn diagram has two overlapping circles, one labeled 'objective safety' and the the other 'feeling safety.' An annotation points at the overlapping segment and says that these meanings sometimes coincide, but are distinct. Another annotation points at the non-overlapping segment of 'feeling safety' and notes that we can feel safe without being objectively safe."

<p>
	We can see this below with Zoe, who has a traumatic experience that never leads to feelings of <emotions>safety</emotions>, even when she’s technically safe:

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        
        <narration>	Middle school Zoe is biking behind a truck, when a tire flies out of the bed and nearly hits her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe experiences sudden and unexpected physical danger)</notes></p> 
        
        <p><narration>She pulls over to the side, shaking, and sits down on the grass, feeling sick. </narration><notes>(&larr;Zoe does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel this was OK)</notes>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        
            <narration>She gets home and feels unsettled all day. She doesn’t tell anyone, and when she wakes up in the morning, she’s blotted out the memory. When she thinks of it years later, it causes her gut to clench.</narration>
        
        
             <notes>(&larr;the mistake is <outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> evaluated as OK, even when technically safe)</notes>

<p>
	Whenever this topic is active, the mistake always overwhelms the OK. In this case, it doesn’t matter if we think Zoe “should” feel safety&mdash;the absence of humor shows an absence of humor family words like
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>.

            We can use humor to look beyond how <term>we’re</term> interpreting a situation&mdash;and beyond how we think people <term>should</term> be experiencing a situation&mdash;and instead make direct observations of how someone is <term2>actually</term2> experiencing something.
