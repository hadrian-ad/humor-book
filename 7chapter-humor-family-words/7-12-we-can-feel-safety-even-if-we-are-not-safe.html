We can feel safety even if we’re not safe
</h1>

<p>
	Like any of our humor family words, we don’t always feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions> when we're "technically" safe—just like we <em>can</em> feel <emotions>safety</emotions> even when we’re <em>not</em> technically safe: 
</p>

    <h2>technically safe, no feeling of
        
        <emotions>safety</emotions></h2>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
	
		<narration>Brad watches an internet video about how poor people thousands of miles away are entering the country.</narration>
	
</p>
<p>
	<speaker>Host:</speaker> <speech>“Will they sneak into your community and kill you in your sleep? Viewer, all I can say is…”</speech>
	
		<internalaction>(ominously)</internalaction>
	
	 <speech>“It’s possible.”</speech>
</p>
<p>
	
		<narration>Brad gets up and looks out the window of his suburban community. It’s terrible to no longer feel safe in your own home.</narration> <notes>(&larr;no safety&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes>

<h2>
    technically unsafe, a feeling of
    
        <emotions>safety</emotions>

		<narration>Xiaowei and Lina are lighting rags on fire and throwing them around the shed. At first, Lina was stressed out by this—but pretty soon she realizes it’s fun, and they laugh as they try to melt things.</narration> <notes>(&larr;safety&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
	
	
		<narration>They never know how close the rags were to landing on flammable material.</narration>

    </div>
<p>
	Even if Brad is statistically one of the safest, securest people on the planet, if he evaluates mistakes as not OK, he won’t feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>. 
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, it doesn’t matter if playing with fire in uncontrolled environments has real risk of personal negative consequences—if Xiaowei and Lina don’t see the personal risk outweighing the mistake, they’ll feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>.
	
</p>
<p>
	Humor marks an temporary arrangement of our evaluations—which doesn’t mean those evaluations are somehow “right” by objective, comparative assessments. Sometimes these things overlap—but not always:

<p>
	We can see this below with Zoe, who has a traumatic experience that never leads to feelings of safety, even when she’s technically safe:
	
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
	
	<narration>	Middle school Zoe is biking behind a truck, when a tire flies out of the bed and nearly hits her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe experiences sudden and unexpected physical danger)</notes> <narration>She pulls over to the side, shaking, and sits down on the grass, feeling sick. </narration><notes>(&larr;Zoe does not feel this was OK)</notes>
	
</p>
<p>
	
		<narration>She gets home and feels unsettled all day. She doesn’t tell anyone, and when she wakes up in the morning, she’s blotted out the memory. When she thinks of it years later, it causes her gut to clench.</narration>
	
	
		 <notes>(&larr;the mistake is never evaluated as OK, even when technically safe)</notes>
	
	 
</p>
    </div>
<p>
	Whenever this topic is active, the mistake always overwhelms the OK. In this case, it doesn’t matter if we think Zoe “should” feel safety—the absence of humor shows an absence of humor family words like
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>.

        We can use humor to look beyond how
        
            <em>we’re</em>
        
        interpreting a situation <callback>(“Zoe is in no danger from a past event”)</callback>, and beyond how we think people
        
            <em>should</em>
        
         be interpreting a situation
        
            <callback>(“Zoe should realize there's no point in feeling bad from chance events”)</callback>—and instead make direct observations of how someone is
        
            <em>actually</em>
        
         experiencing something.
