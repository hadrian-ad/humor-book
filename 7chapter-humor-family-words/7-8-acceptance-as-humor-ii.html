Humor family words can happen over time
</h1>
  <p>
	Sometimes, <emotions>acceptance</emotions> is an emotion that happens over a long timescale. We can see this in an argument that results in mistake-predominant emotions:

</p>
    </div>
<p>
	To track what’s going on, we’ll use two main topics for Owen:
</p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none;" >
   <li>[1] ‘Emma’s characterization of Owen’</li>
    <li>[2] ‘Owen’s characterization of Emma.’</li>
    </ul>
<p>
In both these topics, the mistake oversizes the OK, generating mistake-predominant emotions: 
</p>

    <img
    src="../images/7c-images-humor-family-words/7-8-acceptance-as-humor-ii/7-8-0-emma-and-owen-topics.png"
    title="Two topics are involved"
    alt="This image shows two topics as circles, with arrows both leading to their evaluation graphs. One graph is labeled 'Emma's characterization' and the other as 'Owen's characterization. In both graphs, the mistake is larger than the OK.'"
    style="max-width:32rem;">

<p>
	If Owen succeeds in shrinking the mistake and growing the OK in ‘Emma’s characterization,’ he’ll eventually feel humor—which we can describe as <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, and so on:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
	
		<narration>Owen walks around campus after Emma called him out. Her comments about him being a creep bounce around his head. He wasn’t really being a creep, was he?</narration></p> 
		
		<p><narration>He pulls out his phone to look at the photo he had taken of the woman. As he scrolls through his camera roll, he sees several photos like this on his phone. He looks at them for a while, and finally he closes out and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>acceptance</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“What a creeper. Ah, fuck me.” </speech>
</p>
</div>

    <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/7c-images-humor-family-words/7-8-acceptance-as-humor-ii/7-8-1-emma-and-owen-topics-.png"
    title="Two topics are involved II"
    alt="This image shows the evolution of the previous graph. The evaluations in the topic 'Emma's characterization' have moved into balance, generating humor on that topic. A capsule diagram links 'mistake is OK' to 'humor' to 'acceptance.'"
    style="max-width:33rem;">

<p>
	Above, <term>one</term> active topic is generating humor—he feels <emotions>acceptance</emotions>. But the <em>other</em> active topic is still generating mistake-predominant emotions—so Owen is feeling both humor and regret.</p> 
	
	<p>Before Owen can fully reconcile with Emma, he’ll need to feel humor on the other topic too.
</p>
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">
        
        Consider: 
        
    </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        Emma will have to do something similar on her end—to reconcile with Owen, she’ll also need to eventually feel humor from her evaluations on her topics of ‘Owen’s characterization of her’ and ‘Emma’s characterization of him.’ </p>
        
        <p class="considertext">Both Emma and Owen will need to feel mutual humor with each other before they have a full, mutual reconciliation.
