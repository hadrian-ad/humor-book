Emotional Zones

<p>
	These book uses an emotional model with three zones: the <vocab>mistake-predominant</vocab> zone; <vocab>OK-predominant</vocab> zone; and the mistake- and OK-<vocab>balanced</vocab> zone <callback>(humor)</callback>:

        How important is spoken eloquence to humor? Not very! We can read about this in this chapter's

    A deeper look (Eloquence)

<div class="content-example">

<p>We often associate humor with spoken eloquence—but eloquence isn't related to most of the humor in our day-to-day lives. This is easiest to see with humor family words:</p>

    a classmate can make us feel achievement by just saying “congratulations!”
    a friend can make us feel belonging, welcome, and so on just by smiling at us. 
    a romantic partner can make us feel safety just by holding our hands

<p>These moments of humor didn’t require verbal eloquence. We saw this throughout this chapter, where many examples didn't use words at all and so couldn’t have involved spoken eloquence. When Jennifer laughs as she explores her resort room, eloquence was neither here nor there.</p>

<p>This is true even for things like apologies, which at first seem to rely on rhetorical sophistication. But when we think about it, whether we feel reconciliation or not relies less on articulate sophistication and more on things like:</p>

    awareness
    attention on the other person
    honest disclosure
    sincerity
    understanding of the relevant topics

    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>  

<p>This is obvious with children, who can have “interpersonal eloquence” even though they can’t have much spoken eloquence:</p>


<p>Riley: *upset* “Mom? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to break it. Maybe I can make a new one.” (&larr;Riley conveys sincerity, honesty, understanding, and so on without spoken eloquence)</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Jennifer: “Too bad! Not eloquent enough!” (&larr;declined apology&harr;&#xFE0E;no reconciliation&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)
    </p>
- OR -

<p class="vig-indent">Jennifer: “Aw Riley. It’s okay.” (&larr;reconciliation&harr;&#xFE0E;humor) *hugs her* “Let’s just be more careful next time, okay?”</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Riley: *still upset* “Okay.” (&larr;no reconciliation&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Jennifer: “No really. Things break sometime. Dad and I break things sometimes. It just teaches us to be more careful.”</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Riley: *smiles* (&larr;reconciliation&harr;&#xFE0E;humor) “Dad broke the computer!”</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Jennifer: *smiles* (&larr;reconciliation&harr;&#xFE0E;humor) “Remember that? And he learned to be more careful.”</p> 

<p>We can apply the same thing to all our humor family words, where "interpersonal eloquence" is often more important than simple verbal eloquence:</p>


<p>Sam is examining his nearly bald head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</p>

<p>Jennifer: *squeezing him* “You look so handsome.”</p> 

<p>Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately. (&larr;acceptance&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p> 

<p>Jennifer could make Sam feel humor without a speech full of literary allusions and turns of phrase—since eloquence is neither here nor there for most instances of humor in our lives.</p>

<p>In fact, it's usually un-eloquent speech that makes us feel humor in our day-to-day lives—either because clumsy speech itself is a mistake, or because humor degrades our ability to speak eloquently:</p>


<p>Owen: “What if we…” *laughs* “…shit all over the classroom?” *laughs harder*</p>

<p>Emma: *laughs* “Class, I’ve never read…” *laughs* “…such mush… before…”</p>

<p>Owen: *crying from laughter* “Such slippery prose…” (&larr;our ability for verbal eloquence declines as our humor becomes more intense)</p>

<p>Owen and Emma: *whoop with laughter* (&larr;eloquent speech is rarely relevant to feeling humor)</p>


<p>Owen: *telling joke* “So anyway, the priest walks into the bar…” *laughs* “… and he meets the pope…” *laughs harder* “… he meets the pope and…” *laughs harder* (&larr;our ability for verbal eloquence declines as our humor becomes more intense)</p>

<p>Emma and Zoe laugh at Owen’s inability to tell the joke.</p>


<p>Zoe: *not enunciating* “So we should really matcha jamb colchially.” (confused) *pause*</p>

<p>Emma laughs. Zoe starts laughing too. (&larr;eloquent speech is rarely relevant to feeling humor)</p>

<p>Emma: *laughing* “No, matcha jamb bolchially.”</p>

<p>Zoe: *laughing* “I said colchially, dammit!”</p> 

<p>Emma: *laughing harder* “… colchially?!” (&larr;our ability for verbal eloquence declines as our humor becomes more intense)</p>


<p>Sam walks into the kitchen and puts a hand on Jennifer’s shoulder. He sees her bagel without cream cheese.</p>  

<p>Sam: (Surprised) “Oh, it’s the thing.”</p>

<p>Jennifer: *laughs* “Well, I wouldn’t just... you know…” (&larr;eloquent speech is rarely relevant to feeling humor)</p>

<p>Sam: *laughs* *sits down* “Of course not!”</p>

<p>Jennifer: *amused* “One of these days…” *gestures*</p>

<p>Sam: *smiles* (ironically wistful) “One day…” (&larr;most interactions aren't verbally eloquent, especially as we feel more humor)</p> 

<p>All this means that improving our skill at humor isn’t really about improving verbal eloquence. We can have excellent humor skills whether or not we feel eloquent—and simply being eloquent doesn't mean someone has excellent humor skills.</p>

<p>As we start to see achievement, connection, generosity, and so on as methods or objectives that generate humor, it gets easier to think about how everyone has ways of being good at humor—since we don't have to first magically become confident about our ability to speak well to generate humor.</p>

        The generic word "humor" doesn't imply any context. To bundle context to humor, we can use humor family words. This lets us use ordinary language to think narratively about humor.

            We'll use a standardized list of <strong><a href="7-0-humor-family-words.html">humor family words</a></strong> in this book: acceptance, accomplishment, achievement, appreciation, belonging, comfort, connection, delight, forgiveness, generosity, insight, joy, realization, reconciliation, release, revelation, relief, safety, success, and welcome.

            Humor family words are
            <strong><a href="7-3-humor-shows-when-someone-feels-achievement.html">subjective</a></strong>. Whether or not we feel achievement or comfort doesn't depend on any technical metrics—it depends on our individual evaluations of mistakes and OKs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Since humor family words are humor, humor family words have the same qualities as humor—including <strong><a href="7-6-humor-family-words-have-intensity-and-duration.html">intensity and duration</a></strong>.
