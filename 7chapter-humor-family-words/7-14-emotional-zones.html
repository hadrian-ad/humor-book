Humor family words describe an emotional zone
</h1>
 
<p>
	These book uses an emotional model with three zones: the <vocab>mistake-predominant</vocab> zone; <vocab>OK-predominant</vocab> zone; and the mistake- and OK-<vocab>balanced</vocab> zone <callback>(humor)</callback>:
</p>

    title="Quilt graph"
    alt="This quilt graph shows the three zones of humor. Two axes are labeled 'more mistake-predominant' and 'more OK-predominant.' The diagonal is the balanced zone, with the middle representing highest intensity humor."
    style="max-width:32rem;">

<p>
	Humor family words are what go into the <sem>balanced</sem> (humor) zone:
</p>
<div class="list-in-text">

<p>
	Our humor family words describe when the sizes of mistakes and OKs balance. This helps us see where these humor emotions are, and when, relative to other emotions.

<p>We often associate humor with spoken eloquence&mdash;but eloquence isn't really related to most of the humor in our day-to-day lives: </p>

    <ul class="close-list">
    <li>a classmate can make us feel <emotions>achievement</emotions> by just saying “congratulations!”</li>
    <li>a friend can make us feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on just by smiling at us</li> 
    <li>a romantic partner can make us feel <emotions>safety</emotions> just by holding our hands</li>
    </ul>

<p>These moments of humor didn’t require  eloquence&mdash;since eloquence isn't as related to humor as we sometimes think.</p> 


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Through out this chapter, we saw examples that didn't use words at all and so <sem-weak>couldn’t</sem-weak> have involved spoken eloquence. When Jennifer laughs as she explores her resort room, eloquence was neither here nor there.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>This is true even for things like apologies, which at first seem to rely on verbal sophistication. But when we stop to think about it, whether or not we feel <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> depends <term>less</term> on verbal sophistication and <em>more</em> on things like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
       <li>awareness</li>
        <li>attention on the other person</li>
        <li>honest disclosure</li>
        <li>sincerity</li>
        <li>understanding of the relevant topics</li></ul>

    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>  

<p>This is obvious with children, who can have “interpersonal eloquence” even though they can’t have much spoken eloquence:</p>


<div class="vignette">
<p><speaker>Riley:</speaker> <action>*upset*</action> <speech>“Mom? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to break it. Maybe I can make a new one.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Riley conveys sincerity, honesty, understanding, and so on without spoken eloquence)</notes></p>

    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <speech>“No really. Things break sometime. Dad and I break things sometimes. It just teaches us to be more careful.”</speech></p>

    </div>
    
    
    <p>The same thing applies to all our humor family words, where "interpersonal eloquence" is often more important than simple verbal eloquence:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam is examining his nearly bald head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*squeezing him*</action> <speech>“You look so handsome.”</speech></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions>acceptance</emotions>&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
</div> 

<p>Jennifer could make Sam feel humor without a speech full of literary allusions and clever turns of phrase&mdash;since eloquence is neither here nor there for most of the humor in our lives.</p>

<p>In fact, the speech that makes us feel humor in our day-to-day lives is usually <sem-weak>un</sem-weak>-eloquent speech&mdash;either because clumsy speech is itself evaluated as mistake, or because humor degrades our ability to speak eloquently:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“What if we…”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“…shit all over the classroom?”</speech> <action>*laughs harder*</action></p>

    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*crying from laughter*</action> <speech>“Such slippery prose…”</speech> <notes>(&larr;our ability for verbal eloquence declines as our <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> becomes more intense)</notes></p>

</div>


<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Sam walks into the kitchen and puts a hand on Jennifer’s shoulder. He sees her bagel without cream cheese.</narration></p>  
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <internalaction>(surprised)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh, it’s the thing.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Well, I wouldn’t just... you know…”</speech> <notes>(&larr;eloquent speech is rarely relevant to feeling <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <action>*sits down*</action> <speech>“Of course not!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*amused*</action> <speech>“One of these days…”</speech> <action>*gestures*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <internalaction>(ironically wistful)</internalaction> <speech>“One day…” </speech><notes>(&larr;most interactions aren't verbally eloquent, especially as we feel more <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p> </div>

<p>All this means that improving our skill at humor isn’t really about improving verbal eloquence&mdash;most of the time it's about improving something else. <callback>(Interpersonal eloquence.)</callback></p>

<p>It also means that we can have excellent humor skills <sem-weak>whether or not</sem-weak> we feel eloquent&mdash;since most humor isn't about eloquence.</p>

<p>As we start to see <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, and so on as humor, it gets easier to think about how <sem>everyone</sem> has ways of being good at humor&mdash;since the only route to humor doesn't involve magically becoming more eloquent.</p>

    The word "humor" is generic, and doesn't imply any context. To think narratively about humor, we can bundle humor and context together by using <vocab>humor family words</vocab>. This lets us approach humor with more ordinary language.

            We'll use a standardized list of <strong><a href="7-0-humor-family-words.html">humor family words</a></strong> in this book: <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and <emotions>welcome</emotions>. 
        </li>
        <li>
             Humor family words are interchangeable with the word "humor." That means humor family words and humor have the same qualities as humor&mdash;including <strong><a href="7-6-humor-family-words-have-intensity-and-duration.html">intensity and duration</a></strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Humor family words are
            <strong><a href="7-3-humor-shows-when-someone-feels-achievement.html">subjective</a></strong>. Whether or not we feel <emotions>achievement</emotions> or <emotions>comfort</emotions> doesn't depend on any technical metrics&mdash;it depends on our individual evaluations of mistakes and OKs.
