Humor lets us judge who feels safe
</h1>
<p>
	Once we notice the link between humor and
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>
	
	, we have an idea about how to make ourselves or others feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>:
	
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	
		<narration>Santiago is leading a youth camp, and the middle schoolers are a bit nervous around each other the first day. As the facilitator, Santiago notes when humor start appearing, which indicate they’re transitioning into feeling safe. Santiago tries to observe them individually to track how each camper is feeling, and makes an effort to include kids that are showing less tells.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor marks campers’ feelings ofsafety)</notes>

		<narration>Lina gets a job running food at a cafe. Everyone else is much older than her. At first, she’s nervous to try to help out or interact with the other staff. But eventually, she gets more comfortable with her role. She starts smiling more at work, and even posts jokes on their team-wide chatting channel.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor marks Lina’s feeling of safety)</notes>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	
		<narration>Trevor and Minh are joking around on a walk, when Trevor leads them past a
		        
		        ‘do not trespass’
		        
		    sign and onto an industrial park. Trevor is having a great time poking around, but Minh isn’t really into it.</narration>
	
	<speech>“Sure hope we don’t get caught, ha ha,”</speech>
	
		<narration>Minh says nervously. Trevor decides Minh’s humor feel forced, and that Minh doesn’t feel safe doing this, so he decides to leave.</narration>
	
</p>
<p>
	<speech>“Okay, we’ve seen enough!”</speech>
	
	<narration>	 Trevor declares, heading back out. Minh brightens and starts joking again.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor marks Minh’s feelings ofsafety)</notes>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	
		<narration>Someone yells a slur at Yasmin in the grocery parking lot. She convinces herself it doesn’t bother her, but after she parks in the lot a few more times, she notices her lack of humor, and realizes she still feels unsafe in the parking lot.</narration>
	
	<speech>“Shoot,”</speech>
	
		 <narration>she says, suddenly feeling sad.</narration>
	
	
		<notes>(&larr;absence of humor show something about Yasmin’s emotional state she had been missing)</notes>
	
</p>
 </div>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
	
		<narration>Amaya is at Minh’s apartment, and they’re joking and having fun. They start kissing, and Amaya is enjoying herself. She tosses off her shirt and starts massaging Minh over his pants. She stops when she realizes that he’s lost his humor. Is he not feeling comfortable or safe right now? Embarrassed and concerned, she leans back and they talk for a while.</narration> <notes>(&larr; humor as exchanging impressions of safety)</notes>

		 
	
</p>
    </div>
<p>
	When Santiago, Trevor, Yasmin, and Amaya can recognize humor—or the lack of humor—they’re better able to act within their social environments. 
</p>
<p>
	And while we used
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>
	
	 here, the exact same approach can be used for all our humor family words. We can use humor to track who is or isn’t feeling something like
	
		<emotions>achievement</emotions>
	
	,
	
		<emotions>reconciliation</emotions>
	
	,
	
		 <emotions>relief</emotions>
	
	,
	
		<emotions>welcome</emotions>,
	
	 and so on. 
</p>
<p>
	And since humor family words
	
		<em>are</em>
	
	humor, when we improve our humor skill, we’re also improving our skill at helping ourselves or others feel
	
		<emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, welcome,
	
	and so on. 
</p>
