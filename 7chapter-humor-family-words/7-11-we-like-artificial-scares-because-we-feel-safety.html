    We like artificial scares because we feel safety
</h1>
  
<p>
	One reason we sometimes like being artificially scared is that we feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>
	
	 afterwards—we feel humor.

    <p class="considertext">
        This is part of the appeal of something like bungee jumps, haunted houses, jump scares, movie gore, pranks, peek-a-boo, pretend injury, roller coasters, horror films, and so on—we can feel humor from them! 
    </p>
</div>
<p>
	If we transition from a mistake-predominant emotion into
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>,
	
	 we’ll be feeling humor—if we don’t  feel <emotions>safety</emotions>, we won’t feel humor:
