<p>
	We’ve seen examples before where we could describe the evaluation of mistakes as OK as
	
		<emotions>acceptance</emotions>: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	
    <narration>Timothy calls Jennifer.</narration></p>
		<p><speaker>Timothy:</speaker> <speech>“Jennifer, I know Sam said otherwise, but I checked with the insurance company. They said the treatment is still experimental. They won’t cover it.”</speech>
</p>
		<p>
		<narration>Jennifer is silent for a second. Then she laughs, exhausted</narration>.<notes>(&larr;acceptance&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
		
</p>
	<p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <speech>“That’s what I thought. If we hold a fundraiser, I think we should still be able to cover it.”</speech>
</p>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
		<narration>Sam is examining his nearly bald head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</narration> <speech>“You look so <term>handsome</term>,”</speech> <narration>she says, squeezing him. Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately.</narration> <notes>(&larr;acceptance&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>	
	 
</p>
    </div>
<p>
	In the examples above, people feel humor when they feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>—since acceptance describes a moment where a mistake is seen as OK. 
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">
        
            Consider:
        
    </p>
    <p class="considertext">
        Sam gives a “releasing series of small laughs”—with <emotions>release</emotions> being another of our humor family words. In this case, we can describe his humor as <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on. These words all work, simultaneously, since they’re all describing the same thing—humor.
