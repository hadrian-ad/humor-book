<p>
	Humor has <term>intensity</term> and <term>duration</term>—and since humor family words are context-specific words for humor, humor family words
	
		<em>also</em>
	
	have intensity and duration:

        In all these examples, we can use whichever humor family words seem accurate. For instance, when Lina gets accepted, she doesn’t just feel
        
            <emotions>achievement</emotions>—
        
        we could also describe her humor as
        
            <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>,
