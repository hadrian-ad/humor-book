Sometimes, we try to explain our emotional reaction by trying to analyze content. But this analysis often creates <term>new</term> emotions—instead of explaining our <term2>initial</term2> emotions:


<div class="vignette">
    <narration>Justin is looking at the mime comic and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;initial feeling of humor)</notes>
    
    <speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*thinking*</action> <speech>“It’s funny because African safari hunters were imperialists who in the end choose to shoot their own speechless culture instead of the exotic game that originally drew them.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin analysis content)</notes>
    
    <narration>Justin thinks about his explanation, and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Justin's analysis creates another feeling of humor, which doesn't explain his initial humor)</notes></div>



<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Jennifer sits on the porch, smiling at the sunset.</narration> <notes>(&larr;initial feeling of humor)</notes>
        </p>
    <p>
        <narration>She thinks about sunsets, and a metaphor comes to her:</narration> <speech>“The setting sun is a metaphor for the beauty of conclusions.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer re-examines content)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p>Where did that come from? Maybe that’s why sunsets are so nice. She smiles again. <notes>(&larr;Jennifer's re-examination creates another feeling of humor, which doesn't explain her initial humor)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>If Justin’s analysis of content actually produced his initial humor, he would have thought of the <term>analysis</term> first, and <em>then</em> felt <term>humor</term>. Instead, he felt <term2>humor</term2> first, and <em>then</em> tried to think of an <em>explanation</em>.</p> 

<p>Similarly, when Jennifer thinks of her metaphor, she has a <term>new</term> experience of humor—which doesn't mean her metaphor was an explanation of her <em>initial</em> experience of humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>             
<p class="considertext">It might be an interesting poetic description for Jennifer to say: <callback>“people smile at sunsets because they’re a metaphor for the beauty of conclusions.”</callback> We've seen this before: it's a description being used as an explanation. But this description isn't an explanation of why people sometimes do and sometimes don’t smile at metaphors or sunsets.</p>
</div>



<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Placards</headline>. Sometimes, we see people analyzing content in art or literature—and we think we should do something similar for humor. But if we’re not careful, we can mix up discussions about content with discussions about emotions:</p>
   
    <div class="vignette">
       
        <p>
            <narration>Zoe looks at a painting in a museum.</narration>
        </p>
        <p>
            <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>"Hm!"</speech>
        </p>
        <p>
            <narration>Then she checks the placard.</narration>
        </p>
        <p>
            <speaker>Placard:</speaker> <speech>“In contrast to the mainstream landscapes of the day, the artist expresses disinterest in the modern world through his foregrounding of cattle, which loom over the much smaller urban landscape in the distance.”</speech>
            <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>"Huh."</speech>
        </p>
        </div>
    
    The placard isn’t about emotions, but content. The placard describes subject matter <callback>(“foregrounded cattle”)</callback>, creative intent <callback>(“expresses disinterest”)</callback>, its relation to similar things <callback>(“contrasts with landscapes of the day”)</callback>, and so on. It's not about Zoe's <sem-weak>relation</sem-weak> to that content.
    
    There are two things to note about this. The first is that we shouldn't assume that discussions about content <callback>("content")</callback> is the same thing as a discussion about our relation to that content <callback>("evaluations")</callback>. There's nothing wrong with analyzing content—but we can be wrong if we confuse this with a discussion of emotions.
    
    The second is that the explanation can make <sem-weak>new</sem-weak> changes to Zoe’s emotional state. <callback>("Huh.")</callback> But this is different than helping her make sense of her initial emotional reaction to the painting. <callback>("Hm!")</callback> 
    
    To help Zoe understand her <sem-weak>initial</sem-weak> emotions, the placard would have to link content to Zoe specifically—her topics and evaluatory stance. This isn't the goal of most museum placards, and Zoe shouldn't think a description of content is an <sem-weak>explanation</sem-weak> of her humor.
