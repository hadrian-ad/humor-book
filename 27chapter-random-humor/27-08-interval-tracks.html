<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Fitted humor marks learning</h1>


<p>We can increase the humor we feel by thinking about our two sensorial “tracks:” the first track is our <term>inner</term> senses <callback>(our awareness of our emotional state)</callback>, and the second track is our <em>outer</em> senses <callback>(our awareness of what’s around us)</callback>:</p>


<p>Both of these tracks run simultaneously, but we usually pay attention to one track more than the other.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we’re drawing or weeding, we might prioritize our outer senses and lose track of our inner senses. Similarly, if we’re reading or daydreaming, we might prioritize our inner senses, and lose track of our outer senses.</p>
</div>


<p>But sometimes we give equal attention to both tracks at once, like when we bike down a steep hill. In this case, we’re attentive to our outer senses <callback>(to avoid crashing)</callback> and our inner senses <callback>(our exhilaration is hard to ignore, and we use our emotions to gauge our sense of risk)</callback>. These moments of equal attention tend to be vivid.</p>

<p>Generally, when our attention to these two tracks is balanced, we have more opportunities to feel humor. Conversely, when we’re <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> giving equal attention to these tracks, we limit our opportunity to feel humor.</p> 

<h2>Not paying attention to our <outcome-contrast>outer</outcome-contrast> senses limits our humor</h2>
<div class="h2">
    
    <p>When we’re not paying attention to our outer senses, we miss things we <sem-weak>could</sem-weak> feel humor at. In the same way we miss 100% of the shots we don't take, we're not going to feel humor toward a bug if our eyes slide over it without really noticing it.</p>
    
    
    <div class="for-instance">
       <p class="for-instance">For instance</p>
        <p class="for-instance-text">when Zoe is browsing a used bookstore, she finds book titles that make her feel humor—like <book-title>Why be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</book-title> and Ferdydurke. But if she’s internally preoccupied and only perfunctorily scanning the shelves, not really registering anything—she won’t feel humor from them. By not paying attention to her outer senses, she limits her opportunities to feel humor.</p>
        </div>
</div>

<h2>Not paying attention to our <outcome-contrast>inner</outcome-contrast> senses limits our humor</h2>

<div class="h2">
   
   <p>When we’re not paying attention to our inner senses, we don't notice the humor that we do experience—it simply happens without us noticing it.</p>
    
    <p>That's because we're not aware of all the humor that we do feel. We already know what this feels like for something like anxiety—someone suggests we stop bouncing our leg, and we're surprised to find that we are. The same thing happens with humor.</p>
    
    <p>Once it's pointed out, we see this everywhere—like when we sit down at the dinner table and our kids and partner immediately know our mood—including how much humor we’re feeling. They intuitively register how intensely we’re <humor-outcomes>focused on the present</humor-outcomes>, <humor-outcomes>relaxing our posture</humor-outcomes>, <humor-outcomes>socially integrating</humor-outcomes>, <humor-outcomes>socially tightening</humor-outcomes>, <humor-outcomes>smiling</humor-outcomes>, and so on. They often notice more subtle variations in our humor day by day than we do.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">Sometimes, the humor tells our family picks up on are very subtle—it’s how we scootch in our chair; how long we talk to someone; how we get up to get more food; and so on. Other times, these humor tells aren’t subtle to others, but just subtle to us—like how everyone registers more about our emotional state from our face than we do.</p>
        
        
        <p class="considertext">In this sense, our family is more aware of our mood than we are. They can even be aware of our humor when we're not—something that especially happens when we're not paying attention to our inner senses.</p>
    </div>
    
    </div>


<p>When we pay attention to <sem-weak>both</sem-weak> tracks at the same time, we have enough information to feel humor almost whenever we want. That’s because our <term>outer senses</term> always have the <term>potential</term> for humor, since most observations have a possible framing where mistakes and OK balance. And our <em>inner senses</em> tell us when and on what topic we need to change our evaluations so that we <em>do</em> feel humor.</p> 

<p>When we’re paying attention to both tracks simultaneously, we feel greater vividness and emotional control. Sometimes this vividness is compelled, like when we bike downhill. But we’ll notice we feel it elsewhere too, during moments of lucid awareness, like when we’re: </p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>admiring how we look when we dress up</li>
    <li>being touched romantically</li>
    <li>feeling the wind blow against us</li>
    <li>fishing in a canoe</li>
    <li>getting into a bed with fresh sheets</li>
    <li>reading a book by a window</li>
    <li>taking a shower</li>
    <li>watching our favorite show</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>These experiences are often enjoyable <sem-weak>because</sem-weak> we’re paying attention to both sensorial tracks—it’s not really due to content per se. This is why we can have vivid experiences everywhere, not just dependent on the "excitement" of what's happening.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Sometimes watching dust in light beams is vivid and intense—and sometimes not. The <sem-weak>content</sem-weak> isn’t controlling the vividness of our experiences, but something else.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">One way of thinking about what controls this vividness is how we’re internally and externally relating things—how these two tracks entangle and complement each other—and our awareness of these processes.</p>
</div>

<p>With practice, we can pay attention to both tracks on command—something that lets us experience not just vividness, but exponentially more humor as well. It’s a feeling of entwining our inner and outer senses—and is one way of describing more specifically what we mean when we say we “feel alive.”</p>
