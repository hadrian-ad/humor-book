<p>We can look at another case study of “random humor:”</p>

  

<div class="h2">
   <p><strong>Mistakes and OKs.</strong> As the students get to know each other, their OK grows. This means their mistakes have to get larger to keep up with the growing OK. The content doesn’t matter so much—any random content will generate humor, so long as it generates mistakes that keep pace with the growing OK.</p>
    
    <ul style="list-style-type: none">
       <li>Panel 1: When the group first meets, the group has a small OK—since there’s risk of negative consequences around people we don’t know. This is where formal manners help, which provides a way of keeping our mistakes small during introductions while we grow OKs. <callback>(“Good morning.”)</callback></li>
        
        <li>Panel 2: As the group gets to know each other, their OK increases—leading to medium-intensity humor, with humor tells like <humor-tell>informality</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>, and so on.</li>
        
        <li>Panel 3: At this point, the OK has increased enough that they have to put some effort to match a mistake with the increasingly large OK. <callback>(“Sup, biiitch!”)</callback></li>
        
        <li>Panel 4: In the final panel, everyone is familiar enough with each other that they have a very large OK. They then need to create large mistakes to continue fueling high-intensity humor.</li>
        </ul>
    
    
    <p>Like Riley, the students don’t need to overthink this. When there's a low dress code, “random” content works well enough to create mistakes.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why.</strong> To get ready to start group work, the students want to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on—and as part of this, are <humor-outcomes>symbolizing close ties</humor-outcomes>, <humor-outcomes>creating rapport</humor-outcomes>, <humor-outcomes>turning negative emotions into positive emotions</humor-outcomes>, and so on. These things are both enjoyable and helpful—since humor tells like <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell> help them get through work. </p>
    
<p><strong>Humor dress codes.</strong> When the students first meet, they have a high humor dress code. This helps them synchronize and avoid inadvertently bothering each other. As they get to know each other, the dress code lowers. In addition, they become better judges of what and when unfitted humor attempts will be censured. </p>
    
    <p>Since unfitted humor decreases group effectiveness, these unfitted humor attempts probably happen at the beginning of a work session, and fade away as they settle into work. </p>
    
    <p><strong>Humor bush.</strong> The students increase the intensity of their humor over time to grow a larger humor bush. Since the students are around the same age, at the same institution, with similar styles of dress, similar displays of wealth, and so on—a large humor bush between them is fitted.</p>
    
    <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
    <p class="considertext">Larger humor bushes aren’t always more fitted—like if one member of their group was:</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list" style="margin-left: 1rem">
    <li>much older or younger than the others</li> 
    <li>was a professor or a manager</li> 
    <li>seemed strange</li>
    <li>made cruel remarks</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext
    ">In these cases, the group might not alawys find a larger humor bush fitted.</p>
</div>

    
    </div>


<p>In both case studies, people were trying to balance the size of mistakes and OKs together to generate humor&mdash;for the same reasons and same methods we've seen throughout this book.</p>  

<p>Even though the content is "random," the content isn't as relevant as it might seem on the surface. We don't need to look too deely at <callback>"PINEAPPLE"</callback> or <callback>"ouloulouloul"</callback> themselves to understand what's going on and why.</p>
