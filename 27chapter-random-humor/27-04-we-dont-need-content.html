<p>Sometimes when we try to explain why something was funny, we exclude <term>people</term> from our explanations—and only focus on <term2>content</term2>.</p> 

<p>But when we do this, we won't be able to find satisfying explanations of humor, since content by itself doesn't explain humor:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><speech>“The comic is funny because a ‘mime rifle’ is a spoof on how many types of guns there are.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;focusing only on content doesn’t really explain why this is funny, when, and to who)</notes></p>
</div>

 

<div class="vignette"><p><speech>“The comic is funny because the mime looks sad because no one likes them, and it’s funny that no one likes mimes.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;focusing only on content doesn’t really explain why this is funny, when, and to who)</notes></p>
    </div>
 

<div class="vignette"><p><speech>“The comic is funny because hunters are unfunny, that’s why they hate mimes—that’s the joke.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;focusing only on content doesn’t really explain why this is funny, when, and to who)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 

<div class="vignette"><p><speech>“The comic is funny because African safari hunters were imperialists who in the end choose to shoot their own speechless culture instead of the exotic game that originally drew them.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;focusing only on content doesn’t really explain why this is funny, when, and to who)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>The pseudo-explanations above never mention an evaluator <callback>("I")</callback> or any evaluations—they just try to explain humor through content. <callback>(“There are many types of guns…”)</callback> But this never really works. </p>


<p>That's because humor happens in people. When we avoid talking about people, we're avoiding what we're trying to explain!</p>

<p>We can explain the presence or absence of humor without involving content at all: <callback>“I laughed because it deviated from my expectations, and I felt an equal amount of security from personal negative consequences.”</callback></p>

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">At this point, we can be more specific about <sem-weak>why</sem-weak> something deviated from our expectations, and why we judged consequences the way we did. This lets us talk productively about why <em>someone</em> felt humor at a comic with a mime.</p>

<p class="considertext">It's not the content that matters, but someone's <em>relationship</em> to the content. This is why we need to stay tethered to evaluations when talking about content—otherwise we risk ignoring this relationship between expectations, observations, and consequences.</p>

</div>
 

<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Pseudo.</headline> Sometimes we confuse <term>descriptions</term> for <term2>explanations</term2>. If we say <callback>"I like roses because they're red,"</callback> we're just describing roses, not explaining why we like it. </p>
    
    <p>It's the same thing with humor. If we say <callback>"the comic is funny because it has a mime,"</callback> we're describing the comic, not explaining why we felt humor. In day-to-day conversation, this doesn't matter so much. But it's worth seeing that sometimes descriptions pose as explanations.</p> 
    
    <p>If we read an ingenious satire, we may say <callback>"it's funny because it's clever.</callback>" We're used to using "cleverness" as pseudo-explanations of humor. But it's not a real explanation—since we come across random comics that aren't clever, and still laugh.</p> 
    
    <p>When we don't know to look for pseudo-explanations, we start taking them literally. This can confuse us! We'll encounter clever things that don't make us laugh, and things that make us laugh that aren't clever—and we make even start thinking of random humor as fundamentally bizarre.</p>
    
    <p>When we instead allow descriptions to be descriptions, we'll be in a better position to think about <sem-weak>explanations</sem-weak> that interact with those descriptions. This is something that's obvious with random humor attempts—since the descriptions feel underwhelming—but is important for any humor attempt.</p>
