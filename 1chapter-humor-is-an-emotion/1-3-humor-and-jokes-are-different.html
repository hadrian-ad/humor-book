<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Jokes and humor are different things</h1>
   
    <p>Sometimes we think of jokes and humor as the same thing. But they're not—for the same reason insults and <emotions>anger</emotions> are different.</p>
    <p>“Insult” makes us think of a comment, while “<emotions>anger</emotions>” makes us think of an emotion:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-3-images/1-3-0-anger-insult.png" title="Insults and anger are different" alt="This venn diagram shows two circles: insult (comment) and anger (emotion)" 
    style="max-width: 20rem;">
    
    <p>Insults and <emotions>anger</emotions> sometimes coincide, but they're distinct things. There can be insults without <emotions>anger</emotions>, just like there can be <emotions>anger</emotions> without insults:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-3-images/1-3-1-anger-insult-overlap.png" title="Insults and anger sometimes overlap, but are distinct" alt="This venn diagram shows that the two circles, insult (comment) and anger (emotion), sometimes intersect but they don't always. There are insults that don't involve anger, just like there is anger that don't involve insults."
    
    style="max-width: 18rem;">
    
    <p>It’s the same thing for jokes and <emotions>humor</emotions>. They sometimes coincide—but they’re distinct things. There can be jokes without <emotions>humor</emotions>, and <emotions>humor</emotions> without jokes:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-3-images/1-3-2-humor-joke-overlap.png" title="Jokes and humor are different" alt="This venn diagram shows has an analagous set-up to the previous diagrams, this time using joke (comment) as one category, and humor (emotion) as the other. These sometimes intersect, but don't always."
    
    style="max-width: 20rem;">


    <p>The complication is that we sometimes call jokes “humor.” In this case, we have the same-sounding word for <sem>both</sem> comments and emotions. There's humor and <emotions>humor</emotions>:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-3-images/1-3-3-humor-humor-overlap.png" title="Humor (comment) and humor (emotion) are different" alt="This venn diagram shows how the humor (comment) category and the humor (emotion) category don't always intersect."
    
    style="max-width: 20rem;">

    
    <p>This can make us think of these two things as more similar than they are. But humor <callback>(comment)</callback> and <emotions>humor</emotions> <callback>(emotion)</callback> aren’t the same thing—for the same reason insults and <emotions>anger</emotions> aren’t the same thing!</p>
    
    
     <div class="box">    
    <p><headline>Jumping.</headline> We often jump between different meanings of humor, even without noticing that we do:</p> 
   <div class="vignette">
                    
            <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(curiously)</internalaction> <speech>“Jessica, what do you think about humor?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t clarify whether she’s asking about comments, a genre, a personality trait, a quality, or an emotion)</notes></p>
            <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <speech>“Ohmigosh, I am so bad at jokes!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jessica decides that Emma is asking about jokes)</notes> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“I once tried to tell Elias that joke the waitress told Chief in <i>Fired Fireman</i>…”</speech> <action>*stops to laugh*</action> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“… the one about the difference between boobs and an apron…?”</speech> <narration>*laughs harder*</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“… and I <sem>mangled</sem> it. God! I’m just not that good at humor. Never been funny. So there you go.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;conversation about humor turns into a conversation about jokes)</notes></p>
            <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <narration>*laughs*</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jessica helps Emma feel <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“I’ll never forget that time you messed up that <i>knock, knock</i> joke.”</speech></p>
            <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Jessica feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <internalaction>(recalling)</internalaction> <speech>“Knock, knock!”</speech></p>

     <p>Jessica and Emma aren't settled on a meaning for the word "humor." They jump from "humor <callback>(unspecified)</callback>" to "humor <callback>(jokes)</callback>" to "humor <callback>(the ability to make someone laugh with jokes)</callback>."</p>
            
  <p>We can notice that both Jessica and Emma laughed during this conversation&mdash;they both felt humor. This is the sort of humor we'll be looking at throughout this book.</p>
