  We'll focus on humor, not genres
</h1>
  
<p>We can smile and laugh in any situation, like after:</p>

   <ul class="close-list">
                  
           <li>hearing a joke</li>
           <li>receiving a gift </li>
           <li>being kissed</li>
            <li>biking downhill</li>
           <li>cresting into a beautiful view</li>
           <li>putting clothes on fresh out of the drier</li>
           <li>feeling a gust of wind</li>
                            <li>finishing a workout</li>
                            <li>seeing a fox</li>
           <li>seeing a friend</li>
           <li>hearing news</li>
           <li>watching someone get hurt</li>
               
       
    </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>
 

<p>Of course, we <term>sometimes</term> smile and laugh at these things&mdash;but <em>not always</em>!</p>

<p>Of course, to make matters more confusing, we sometimes laugh at something <sem>and</sem> it's opposite&mdash;like when we laugh after:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
  <li> being complimented <sem>and</sem> being insulted</li>
           

 <li>realizing we've been foolish <sem>and</sem> realizing we've been wise</li>
<li>getting pressured successfully <sem>and</sem> getting pressured unsuccessfully</li>    
<li>playing a game and winning <sem>and</sem> playing a game and losing</li>
<li>seeing something exceptionally beautiful <sem>and</sem> seeing something exceptionally  ugly</li>
<li>recalling a memory that's we're proud of <sem>and</sem> recalling a memory we're embarrassing by</li>
             </ul>
             
                 <p class="and-so-on"> and so on</p>

 <p>It can all feel overwhelming&mdash;humor can feel ad hoc, contradictory, unpredictable, and so on.</p>
 -->
  

 <p>To organize our thinking at the beginning, we'll just be focusing on <emotions>humor</emotions>:</p>

    <p>By focusing on humor, we'll set aside specific situations and instead learn <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> we feel humor, in <sem>any</sem> case.</p>

    <div class="box">
             
     <p>We often use comedic terms to explain <emotions>humor</emotions>. But this ends up being a backward explanation! We can understand why this is by thinking about eating and restaurants.</p>
                           
    <p>Which came first&mdash;<term>eating</term> or <em>restaurants</em>? <sem-weak>Eating</sem-weak> did&mdash;which is why if all restaurants disappeared tomorrow, there would still be eating.</p>
             
    <p>Similarly, which came first&mdash;<term><emotions>humor</emotions></term> <callback>(smiling and laughing)</callback> or <em>comedies</em>? <sem-weak>Humor</sem-weak> did&mdash;which is why if all comedies disappeared tomorrow, there would still be humor.</p>
              
     <p>That's why it would be backward to explain <term>eating</term> in terms of being <term>"restaurantic"</term>&mdash;just like it would be backward to explain <em>smiling and laughing</em> (<emotions>humor</emotions>) in terms of being <em>"comedic."</em> 
   
           <p>In the same way a book could describe <term>eating</term> accurately <outcome-contrast>without</outcome-contrast> mentioning <term>restaurants</term>, it's possible to describe <em><emotions>humor</emotions></em> accurately <outcome-contrast>without</outcome-contrast> mentioning <em>comedy</em> <Sem>at all</Sem>.</p>         
                  
    <p>For many of us, this approach to humor from the foundations is something unexpected or strange. But as we'll see, this approach creates a powerful base for thinking accurately about the experiences we have in the world.</p>

         <p class="considertext

         <p class="considertext">However, to avoid putting the cart before the horse, it's important to be able to see the bigger picture first. This will give greatest depth and power to our activities in various applied contexts.</p>
