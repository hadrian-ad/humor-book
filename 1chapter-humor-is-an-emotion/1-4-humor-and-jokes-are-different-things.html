  This book focuses on humor, not jokes
</h1>
  
<p>
	Instead of talking about <term>
	    <emotions>humor</emotions>
	</term> <callback>(emotions)</callback>, we sometimes instead drift into talking about <em>humor</em> <callback>(genres)</callback>&mdash;like "farces," "jokes," "irony," and so on. The problem with this is that we don't always laugh or smile at these things!</p>
		
	<p>Like anything else, comedies, farces, jokes, irony, and so on <sem>can</sem> lead to <emotions>humor</emotions>&mdash;but they don’t always.
</p>

These smaller circles sometimes intersect with humor, but don't always."
    style="max-width: 16rem;">
    
<p>
	Since jokes, comedies, wittiness, satire, and so on can lead to <sem-weak>any</sem-weak> emotion outcome, they're not the same thing as <emotions>humor</emotions>:
</p>

<p>
	Since we’re focusing on <term>humor</term> in this book, we <outcome-contrast>won’t</outcome-contrast> be focusing on <em>jokes</em> or <em>satire</em>&mdash;since those things aren’t <emotions>humor</emotions>.</p> 
   
   <p>Instead, we'll stay focused on <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> the emotion of humor happens.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
        <p class="considertext">Thinking a <term>joke</term> will explain <term>laughing</term> is a bit like thinking a <em>salad</em> will explain <em>eating</em>.</p> 
                
                <p class="considertext">Why can't a salad explain eating? For one, we can have a salad and not eat it&mdash;since a salad isn't the same thing as eating.</p>
                
                <p class="considertext">For another, if our goal is to explain "eating," we can distort or narrow our explanation if we focus on "eating a salad" instead of "eating" more generally.</p>  </div>


 <div class="box">    

<p><headline>Jokes and everything.</headline> We sometimes call everything we laugh at a joke:  <callback>"We sometimes laugh at jokes. Therefore <sem>everything</sem> we laugh at is some kind of joke."</callback></p> 

   
<p>It's easy to see this as idiomatic by creating new idioms. If we started saying: <callback>"we sometimes buy coffee. Therefore, <sem>everything</sem> we buy is some kind of coffee”</callback>&mdash;we would never take this expression too literally!</p>
   
<p>It's strange to frame all <term>buying</term> around <term>coffee</term> for the same reasons  it's strange to frame all <em>laughing</em> around <em>jokes</em>.</p>

<div class="content-example">
     
     <p>
	We often notice humor mainly when it’s unambiguous&mdash;like when we’re laughing at a movie:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Emma and Owen are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title>.</narration></p> 
	
	<p><narration>Chief is hired to work at a warehouse, but his attempt to move crates of lobsters goes horribly, horribly wrong. Emma and Owen laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;just <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
</p>
    </div>

    style="max-width: 17rem;">
       
<p>
	But even though we sometimes seem to feel “one” emotion, most emotions happen in a mix&mdash;like when Jennifer feels both humor and anger: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Jennifer looks up from her tablet. Where’s Riley? Her heart sinks in fear. She checks the street, then runs around the house.</narration></p> 
	
	 <p><narration>She sees Riley squatting quietly next to an anthill, and Jennifer puts a hand over her heart and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	<p>
	<speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <internalaction>(relieved)</internalaction> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Riley! Thank god. I thought I told you to stay the side yard.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	</p>

   style="max-width: 24rem;">

<p>
	We can see this in other examples as well:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Trevor walks into class and trips, and the cereal he’s carrying falls down his shirt.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>At first shocked, his classmates see that he’s not hurt and start to laugh with relief.</narration></p>

<p>
	<narration>Riley is bored at the dinner table, and Sam makes a funny face at her.</narration></p>

    style="max-width: 18rem;">
	
<p>
	In complicated emotional states, a small amount of humor may mingle with feelings of anger, bitterness, disappointment, sadness, and so on:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Emma sadly shuts the door to her apartment.</narration></p>
	<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“I can’t believe Sara didn’t tell me until today that she decided to move!”</speech></p> 
	<p><narration>She looks around. She feels angry, resentful, regretful, sad. A cloud of bitter humor passes through her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s complicated emotional state includes some <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
