  This book focuses on humor, not jokes
</h1>
  
<p>
	Instead of talking about <emotions>humor</emotions> <callback>(emotions)</callback>, we sometimes drift into talking about humor <callback>(genres)</callback> instead&mdash;like "farces," "jokes," "irony," and so on. The problem with this is that we don't always laugh or smile at these things!</p>
		
	<p>Like anything else, comedies, farces, jokes, irony, satires, witty remarks, and so on <sem>can</sem> lead to <emotions>humor</emotions>&mdash;but they don’t always.
</p>

	Instead, jokes, comedies, wittiness, satire, and so on can lead to <sem-weak>any</sem-weak> emotion outcome:

<p>
	Since we’re focusing on <term>humor</term> in this book, we won’t focus on <em>jokes</em> or <em>satire</em>&mdash;since those things aren’t <emotions>humor</emotions>.</p> 
   
   <p>Humor is an emotion&mdash;and we'll stay focused on <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> this emotion happens.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
        <p class="considertext">Sometimes we get preoccupied with categories. <callback>(Jokes, comedies, satires, and so on.)</callback> But thinking a <term>joke</term> will explain <term>laughing</term> is a bit like thinking a <em>salad</em> will explain <em>eating</em>.</p> 
                
                <p class="considertext">Why can't a salad explain eating? For one, we can have a salad and not eat it&mdash;since a salad isn't the same thing as eating.</p>
                
                <p class="considertext">For another, if our goal is to explain "eating," we can distort or narrow things by explaining "eating a salad" instead.</p>  </div>

<!--
<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">
	Consider:</p>
<p class="considertext">
	We'll be learning why <sem-weak>anything</sem-weak> does or doesn't lead to an outcome of humor. This explanation will be inclusive to jokes and satire&mdash;but inclusive to everything else besides. We won't need to focus on jokes to understand humor.</p> 	
    </div>
    -->

 <div class="box">    

<p><headline>Jokes and tentpoles.</headline> We sometimes call everything we laugh at a joke:  <callback>"We sometimes laugh at jokes. Therefore <sem>everything</sem> we laugh at is some kind of joke."</callback></p> 

   
<p>It's easy to see this as idiomatic. We can make a similar analogy: <callback>"we sometimes buy coffee. Therefore, <sem>everything</sem> we buy is some kind of coffee.”</callback> We would never take this expression too literally!</p>
   
<p>For the same reason it would be strange to frame all <term>buying</term> around <term>coffee</term>, it would be strange to frame all <em>laughing</em> around <em>jokes</em>.</p>

	We often notice humor mainly when it’s unambiguous&mdash;like when we’re laughing at a movie:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Emma and Owen are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title>.</narration></p> 
	
	<p><narration>Chief is hired to work at a warehouse, but his attempt to move crates of lobsters goes horribly, horribly wrong. Emma and Owen laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;just <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>

    style="max-width: 17rem;">
       
<p>
	But even though we sometimes seem to feel “one” emotion, most emotions happen in a mix—like when Jennifer feels both humor and anger: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Jennifer looks up from her tablet. Where’s Riley? Her heart sinks in fear. She checks the street, then runs around the house. She sees Riley squatting quietly next to an anthill, and Jennifer puts a hand over her heart and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	<p>
	<speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <internalaction>(relieved)</internalaction> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Riley! Thank god. I thought I told you to stay the side yard.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>

   style="max-width: 24rem;">

<p>
	We can see this in other examples as well:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Trevor walks into class and trips, and the cereal he’s carrying falls down his shirt.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>At first shocked, his classmates see that he’s not hurt and start to laugh with relief.</narration></p>

    style="max-width: 18rem;">
	
<p>
	In complicated emotional states, a small amount of humor may mingle with feelings of anger, bitterness, disappointment, sadness, and so on:
</p>

<div class="vignette">

    <narration>Emma sadly shuts the door to her apartment.</narration></p>
	<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“I can’t believe Sara didn’t tell me until today that she decided to move!”</speech></p>
