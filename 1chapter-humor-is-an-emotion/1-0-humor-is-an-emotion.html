        We don’t always think of humor as an emotion. But when we think about it, humor behaves just like any emotion:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            We have physical reactions when we feel <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term>, like <term>smiles or laughs</term>&mdash;in the same way we have physical reactions when we feel <em><emotions-in-notes>sadness</emotions-in-notes></em>, like <em>sighing or tears</em>.
        </li>
          
           <li>
            We can feel <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term> grow over time, like over the course of a <term>funny story</term>&mdash;in the same way we can feel <em><emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes></em> grow over time, like over the course of an <em>infuriating story</em>.
        </li>

        <li>
            We sometimes have <term>bursts</term> of unexpected <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term>&mdash;in the same way we sometimes have <em>bursts </em>of unexpected <em><emotions-in-notes>grief</emotions-in-notes></em> or <em><emotions-in-notes>irritation</emotions-in-notes></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <term><emotions-in-notes>Humor</emotions-in-notes></term> has dimensions of <term>intensity and duration</term> to it&mdash;in the same way <em><emotions-in-notes>sadness</emotions-in-notes></em> or <em><emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes></em> has dimensions of <em>intensity and duration</em> to it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Babies go through periods of <term><emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes></term>&mdash;in the same way they go through periods of <em><emotions-in-notes>boredom</emotions-in-notes></em> or <em><emotions-in-notes>irritation</emotions-in-notes></em>.
        </li>
        <li>

    </ul>

        (and so on)

 Since humor behaves similarly to things like anger and sadness, we’ll be calling humor an emotion:</p> 
        
           <p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion</p>
        
 <p>We'll be going over this in the rest of this chapter.
    </p>


    

<div class="box">   
      <p><headline>Demystifying humor.</headline> Sometimes, without really thinking about it, we put humor into its own category:
        </p>
<img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-0-images/1-0-1-humor-excluded.png" title="Excluded humor" style="max-width: 18rem;"
        
        alt="This figure clusters emotions that we usually think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, and shame. Humor is put off to the side, as outside that cluster.">
        <p>
            Humor becomes mysterious and hard to think about when it's isolated from everything else. But humor becomes easier to think about when we put similar things together:
        </p>
        <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-0-images/1-0-2-humor-included.png"
        style="max-width: 11rem;"
        title="Included humor"
        
        alt="This figure evolves the previous diagram by including humor in the same cluster of what we typically think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, shame."
        
        style="max-width: 13rem;">
        <p>
            By plugging humor into our existing understanding of emotions, we’ll have a greater intuitive understanding of humor.
