<h1 id="exclude-navigation">We'll stick to one meaning of humor</h1>
   
<p>Humor is a broad word in our day-to-day conversations. At different times, we use the word "humor" to refer to a kind of:</p>
     
<ul class="close-list">
    <li><strong>comment</strong> <callback>(compliment, insult, <strong>humor</strong>, question, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>genre</strong> <callback>(drama, horror, <strong>humor</strong>, thriller, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>personality trait</strong> <callback>(gentleness, <strong>humor</strong>, temper, thoughtfulness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>quality</strong> <callback>(aggressive, beauty, <strong>humor</strong>, meanness, persuasiveness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>emotion</strong> <callback>(anger, <strong>humor</strong>, listlessness, sadness, and so on)</callback></li></ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>We see this fluidity of meaning all the time:</p>
    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe and Emma do a double take on a joke scribbled on a white board.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(disapprovingly)</internalaction> <speech>“Distasteful humor.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a comment or joke)</notes></p></div>
    
    <div class="vignette"><p><speaker>Amber:</speaker> <action>*to clerk*</action> <speech>“Hey, excuse me, I’m looking for the new Gram Bridgette book—is that in the memoir or the humor section?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a genre)</notes></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Owen fills out his dating profile.</narration> 
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“The most important quality in a partner? Humor. For sure.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a trait)</notes> <action>*checks box*</action></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Timothy takes his residents on rounds.</narration></p> 
    <p><speaker>Timothy:</speaker> <speech>“Having a humorous name like Dr. Ailes is usually a good icebreaker.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a quality)</notes></p> 
    <p><narration>The residents chuckle loudly.</narration></p></div>

    <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Emma goes to Zoe’s house for Thanksgiving. Everyone laughs a lot.</narration></p> 
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(pleased)</internalaction> <speech>“There’s a lot of humor at your house!”</speech>  <notes>(&larr;“humor” as an emotion)</notes> </p></div>

    <p>Sometimes, the broadness of the word "humor" can be a source of utility and rich meaning. Other times, this broadness can lead to confusion.</p> 
        
  <p>We'll avoid potential confusion by sticking <sem>only</sem> use "humor" to refer to an emotion in this book.
  

    <div class="consider">  
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">There’s nothing wrong with other ways we use humor. Instead, it can be wrong to be <sem-weak>inconsistent</sem-weak> in how we use the word humor.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">In this book, we'll want to avoid meaning one thing by "humor" in one sentence, and another thing the next. That's why we'll pick a single lane for "humor" and stay there consistently.</p>
