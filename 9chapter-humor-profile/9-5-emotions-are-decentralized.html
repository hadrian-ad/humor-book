Emotions don't always feel like anything
</h1>

  

<p>In this book, humor is a pattern of humor tells. But individuals have their own pattern too, which we're calling their humor profile.</p> 

<p>These humor tells <em>are</em> humor. Someone's pattern of <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on <em>are</em> humor when they happen together. "Humor" is a descriptive word for when these humor tells happen together.</p> 

<p>Sometimes instead we think that humor is a "feeling." So we'd first <em>feel</em> humor, and <em>then</em> we'd <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, and so on—and so it's the <em>feeling</em> that's really the humor.</p>

<p>But this isn't always a useful way of thinking. To see this, we can notice that we experience emotions all the time without actually "feeling" anything:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>we might not "feel" nervous, but we pee ten times.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" angry, but our hand is shaking.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" anxious, but we’re twirling our hair.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" bored, but we’re bouncing our leg.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel"  sad, but we want to go to bed earlier and earlier.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" jealous of our friend, but find ourselves being passive aggressive toward them.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" humor, but we’re smiling as we’re watching people out the window.</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Above, if we’re urinating a lot before something stressful, it doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" nervous—we're nervous.</p>

<p>It's the same for humor. It doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" humor. If we're smiling while watching something, we're experiencing humor—whether or not we have an abstract internal feeling of "humor."</p>

<p>That's because a feeling of an emotion isn't essential to having it. Instead, the feeling is just another emotion tell—which may or may not be present during our emotions.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Emotions don't always feel like anything</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>Sometimes we think emotions are <em>supposed</em> to feel like something—like an ambient sensation throughout our body or brain that says <i>"this is anger/fear/humor."</i> And and so if we don't "feel" this ambient sensation, we may think it's not there. </p>

<p>But this sets up some problems. If we have a first date coming up, we may feel nothing inside that we'd describe as a "nervous feeling." But we may also urinate ten times. So which is it? Are we not feeling nervous, based on the absence of internal feelings—or are we feeling "nervous," based on behavior?</p>

<p>We already have a de facto answer. If a <em>friend</em> was getting ready for a date, it wouldn't matter if they sincerely insisted they didn't feel nervous—if they were <emotion-tell>pacing</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>peeing all the time</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>wringing their hands</emotion-tell>, and so on, we'd describe them as nervous.</p>

<p>We can do the same thing with ourselves: we can ignore the idea that our emotional states are always supposed to have "internal feelings," and instead look at a broader pattern of actions, behavior, and decisions—our emotion tells—to judge our emotional state. This is true even of humor, which we can experience without it "feeling" like anything.</p>
