Emotions don't always feel like anything
</h1>

  

<p>In this book, humor tells <sem>are</sem> humor. When they happen together, humor tells like <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on <sem>are</sem> humor. 

<p>Sometimes we think that humor is a "feeling" instead. So we'd <term>first</term> feel humor, and <em>then</em> we'd <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, and so on—and so it's the <sem>feeling</sem> that's really the humor.</p>

<p>But this isn't always a useful way of thinking. To see this, we can notice that we experience emotions all the time without actually "feeling" anything:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>we might not "feel" nervous, but we wring our hands.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" angry, but our hand is shaking.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" anxious, but we’re twirling our hair.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" bored, but we’re bouncing our leg.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel"  sad, but we want to go to bed earlier and earlier.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" jealous of our friend, but find ourselves being passive aggressive toward them.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" humor, but we’re smiling as we’re watching people out the window.</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>If we’re wringing our hands a lot before something stressful, it doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" nervous—we're nervous.</p>

<p>It's the same for humor. It doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" humor. If we're smiling and loosening while watching something—we're feeling humor. It doesn't matter if there's no abstract internal feeling of "humor."</p>

<p>That's because a "feeling" of an emotion isn't essential to having it. Instead, the feeling is just one of many possible emotion tells—which may or may not be present during our emotions.</p>

<div class="consider">   
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         
<p class="considertext">We sometimes think of an emotion as a centralized thing <callback>("first one thing happens, than many possible outcomes")</callback>, but the word "humor" is a description of decentralized behavior instead <callback>("many possible things first, then one description")</callback></p>
           
           </div>




    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Feeling.</headline> Sometimes we think emotions are <sem>supposed</sem> to feel like something—like an ambient sensation throughout our body or brain that conclusively says <callback>"this is anger/fear/humor."</callback> If we think that, then we'll think that the absence of this feeling means the emotion is absent.</p>

<p>But this sets up some problems. Let's say we have a first date coming up—and that we feel nothing inside that we'd describe as a "nervous feeling." But we also pee ten times the two hours before the date. 

<p>So which is it? Are we <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feeling nervous, based on the <term>absence</term> of internal <em>feelings</em>—or <sem>are</sem> we feeling nervous, based on the <term>presence</term> of <em>actions</em>?</p>

<p>We already have a de facto answer. If a <sem>friend</sem> was getting ready for a date and was pacing, stress urinating, wringing their hands, and so on, we'd describe them as nervous&mdash;even if they sincerely insisted that they didn't feel nervous inside.</p>

<p>We can do the same thing with ourselves: we can ignore the idea that our emotional states are always supposed to have "internal feelings," and instead look at a broader pattern of actions, behavior, and decisions <callback>(emotion tells)</callback> to judge our emotional state.</p> 
    
    <p>This is true for humor too, which we can experience without it "feeling" like anything inside.</p>
