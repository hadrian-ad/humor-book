Emotions are decentralized

In this book, humor is a pattern of humor tells. But individuals have their own pattern too, which we're calling their humor profile. 

These humor tells are humor. Someone's pattern of laughing, social integration, loosening, loss of situational awareness, and so on are humor when they happen together. 

Sometimes we have a more complicated idea—that humor is a "feeling." So we'd first feel humor, and then we'd laugh, loosen, and so on. And it's the feeling that's really the humor.

But this isn't always a useful way of thinking. To see this, we can notice that we experience emotions all the time without actually "feeling" anything: 

we might not "feel" nervous, but we pee ten times
we might not "feel" angry, but our hand is shaking
we might not "feel" anxious, but we’re twirling our hair.
we might not "feel" bored, but we’re bouncing our leg.
we might not "feel"  sad, but we want to go to bed earlier and earlier.
we might not "feel" jealous of our friend, but find ourselves being passive aggressive toward them.
we might not "feel" humor, but we’re smiling as we’re watching people out the window.
(and so on) 

Above, it doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" nervous. If we’re urinating a lot before something stressful, we’re nervous—whether or not we have an abstract internal feeling of "nervousness".

It's the same for humor. It doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" humor. If we're smiling a lot watching something, we're experiencing humor—whether or not we have an abstract internal feeling of "humor."

That's because a feeling of an emotion isn't actually the most important part of an emotion. Instead, the feeling is just another emotion tell—which may or may not be present during our emotions.

Weighing evidence. Sometimes we think emotions are supposed to feel like something—like an ambient sensation throughout our body or brain that says "this is anger/fear/humor."

If we take this far enough, we start thinking the absence of this assumed ambient sensation implies the absence of the emotion. So if we don't have an internal "nervous" feeling, we may think we can't be feeling nervous.

But this sets up some problems. If we have a first date coming up, we may inside feel nothing we'd describe as a "nervous feeling." But we may also pee ten times. So are we not feeling nervous, based on the absence of internal feelings—or are we feeling "nervous," based on behavior?

We can answer this by thinking about how we'd treat a friend. If a friend was getting ready for a date, it wouldn't matter if they sincerely insisted they didn't feel nervous—if they were pacing, peeing all the time, wringing their hands, and so on, we'd describe them as nervous.

We can do the same thing with ourselves: we can ignore the idea that our emotional states are supposed to have "internal feelings," and instead look at a broader pattern of emotion tells to judge our emotional state.
