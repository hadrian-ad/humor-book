Emotions aren't something we "feel" 
</h1>

  
<!--
<p>In this book, humor tells <sem>are</sem> humor. When they happen together, humor tells like <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on <sem>are</sem> humor. 

<p>Sometimes we think that humor is a "feeling." So we'd <term>first</term> feel humor, and <em>then</em> have humor tells like <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>. In this way of thinking, it's a "feeling" of humor that's really the humor.</p>

<p>But this isn't always a useful way of thinking. To see this, we can notice that</p> 

-->

<p>We experience emotions all the time without actually "feeling" anything:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>we might not "feel" nervous, but we wring our hands.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" angry, but our hand is shaking.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" anxious, but we’re twirling our hair.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" bored, but we’re bouncing our leg.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel"  sad, but we want to go to bed earlier and earlier.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" jealous of our friend, but find ourselves being passive aggressive toward them.</li>
    <li>we might not "feel" humor, but we’re smiling as we’re watching people out the window.</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>If we’re wringing our hands a lot before something stressful, it doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" nervous—we're nervous:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> "Worried about your big date?"</p>
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(honestly)</internalaction> <speech>"No! I'm a bit surprised. I feel very calm."</speech></p>
    
<p><narration>Owen heads out, and Emma turns to Zoe.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker>  <speech>"He went to the bathroom like ten times!"</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(worried)</internalaction> <speech>"He kept wringing his hands, too."</speech></p>
    </div>

<p>Above, Emma and Zoe understand Owen to be nervous, even though he sincerely thinks he doesn't "feel" nervous.</p>

<p>That's because Emma and Zoe know the <term>absence</term> of internal <term>feelings</term> isn't as important as the <em>presence</em> of <em>behavior</em>.</p>

<p>It's the same for humor. It doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" humor. If we're <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell> while watching something—we're feeling humor. </p>

<p>That's because a "feeling" of humor isn't essential to there being humor&mdash;it's just one of many possible humor tells, which may or may not be present during humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider</p>
    <p class="considertext">We can set aside the idea that our emotional states are <sem>always</sem> supposed to have "internal feelings," and instead look at a broader pattern of actions, behavior, and decisions <callback>(emotion tells)</callback> to judge our emotional state.</p> 
    
    </div>
<!--
<div class="consider">   
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         
<p class="considertext">We sometimes think of an emotion as a centralized thing <callback>("first one thing happens, than many possible outcomes")</callback>, but the word "humor" is a description of decentralized behavior instead <callback>("many possible things first, then one description")</callback></p>
           
           </div>
-->



    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Feeling.</headline> Sometimes we think emotions are <sem>supposed</sem> to feel like something, like an ambient sensation throughout our body&mdash;something that conclusively indicates <callback>"this is anger/fear/humor."</callback></p> 

<p>This generally uses a model of emotions we learned as children, where emotions were things that were inside us, and that happen in discrete and obvious notes, like from a piano.</p>

<p>As we get older, we're not always presented with alternative models to correspond to our growing ability to reflect on the world&mdash;leading to unsound or incomplete perspectives.</p>
