9. Humor profile
</h1>


<p>In this chapter, we’ll talk about “humor profiles.” Humor profiles are how someone tends to express humor—which humor tells they use when, at what intensity, and in what variation.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">If we watch our friends feel humor, they may feel humor simultaneously—but won't express humor identically. Everyone will express humor differently because they each have a unique humor profile.</p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>Owen, Emma, and Zoe each express humor differently. These differences are their humor profile:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen, Emma, and Zoe are doubled over at their table, laughing.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Zoe is slouched in her chair, one hand on her face, another on Emma’s shoulder. Zoe’s shoulders shake as she goes</narration> <speech>“haaa haaa haaa.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Emma keeps her elbows on the table, dropping her head while she laughs, her feet linked together, going</narration> <speech>“aha aha aha.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen is flushed and has his hands clasped. He tends not to laugh very hard when he feels intense humor—he just smiles so hard his face hurts after.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to him)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>

<p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter</p>. 


<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Familarity allows inferences</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>The more familiar we are with someone's humor profile, the more accurate we can draw inferences from their humor. This is why Emma and Zoe can draw more information from Owen smiling than a stranger could.</p> 

<p>Since Emma and Zoe have seen Owen feel humor thousands of time, they can interpret small variations in his smile. But a stranger doesn't have the comparative basis to make these same interpretations.</p>
