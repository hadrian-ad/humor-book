9. Humor profile
</h1>


<p>In this chapter, we’ll talk about <vocab>humor profiles</vocab>. Humor profiles are <sem-weak>how</sem-weak> someone express humor—which <a href="../8chapter-humor-tell/8-0-humor-tells.html">humor tells</a> they use when, at what intensity, and in what variation.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">If we watch our friends watch a funny video, they may all feel humor at the same time—but they won't express humor in the same way.</p> 
   
<p class="for-instance-text">If we watch five friends watch a hundred funny videos, we'll see that each friend is consistent in their individual way they express humor. The individual way each person expresses humor is their humor profile.</p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>Owen, Emma, and Zoe each express humor differently. These differences are their humor profile:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen, Emma, and Zoe overhear something that makes them smile.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Zoe gives a broad smile. </narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Emma sets her face as she tries to prevent her smile. </narration><notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen grins.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to him)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen, Emma, and Zoe are doubled over at their table, laughing.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Zoe is slouched in her chair, one hand on her face, another on Emma’s shoulder. Zoe’s shoulders shake as she goes</narration> <speech>“haaa haaa haaa.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Emma keeps her elbows on the table, dropping her head while she laughs, her feet linked together, going</narration> <speech>“aha aha aha.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen is flushed and has his hands clasped. He tends not to laugh very hard when he feels intense humor—he just smiles so hard his face hurts after.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to him)</notes></p>

<p>We'll be talking about humor profiles throughout this chapter.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example">Method (Recall)</button>

<div class="content-example">

<p>One method of remembering someone's face is to remember them feeling humor. Since their humor profile is something that makes them them, it's an effective focal point for recall—someone's experience of <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, and so on make durable impressions on us.</p>
 
<p>Sometimes we try to recall a blank, "passport photo" memory of a face. But since we almost never see anyone blank-faced, this is a double task—not just remembering a face, but inventing an expression on it!</p>
   
<p>We can practice this method. Can we recall the faces of our seventh grade teachers by focusing on memories of them smiling? What about the coworkers at our first job? What about politicians from decades ago? How about our siblings at different ages?</p>

<div class="box">

<p><headline>Familiarity.</headline> The more familiar we are with someone's humor profile, the more accurately we can draw inferences from their humor.</p> 

<p>For instance, <term>Emma</term> and <term>Zoe</term> have seen Owen smile tens of thousands of times, which lets them interpret small variations in his smile&mdash;but a <em>stranger</em> seeing Owen smile for the first time doesn't have the same comparative basis as Emma and Zoe.</p> 
    
    <p>This means the stranger can't interpret Owen's emotional state with the same accuracy and nuance that Emma and Zoe can.</p>
