9. Humor profile
</h1>


<p>In this chapter, we’ll talk about <term>humor profiles</term>. Humor profiles are how someone tends to express humor—which <a href="../8chapter-humor-tell/8-0-humor-tells.html"><strong>humor tells</strong></a> they use when, at what intensity, and in what variation.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">If we watch our friends watch a funny video, they may all feel humor simultaneously—but won't express humor identically. Everyone will express humor differently because they each have a unique humor profile.</p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>Owen, Emma, and Zoe each express humor differently. These differences are their humor profile:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen, Emma, and Zoe overhear something that makes them smile.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Zoe gives a broad smile. </narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Emma sets her face as she tries to prevent her smile. </narration><notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen grins.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to him)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen, Emma, and Zoe are doubled over at their table, laughing.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Zoe is slouched in her chair, one hand on her face, another on Emma’s shoulder. Zoe’s shoulders shake as she goes</narration> <speech>“haaa haaa haaa.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Emma keeps her elbows on the table, dropping her head while she laughs, her feet linked together, going</narration> <speech>“aha aha aha.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to her)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen is flushed and has his hands clasped. He tends not to laugh very hard when he feels intense humor—he just smiles so hard his face hurts after.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s humor profile expresses humor in a way specific to him)</notes></p>

<p>We'll be talking about humor profiles throughout this chapter</p>. 


<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Familarity allows inferences</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>The more familiar we are with someone's humor profile, the more accurately we can draw inferences from their humor. For instance, Emma and Zoe have seen Owen feel humor thousands of times—which lets them interpret small variations in his smile.</p> 

<p>By contrast, a stranger seeing Owen for the first time doesn't have the same comparative basis as Emma and Zoe for the same nuanced interpretation of Owen's smile. That's because more familiarity with someone's humor profile allows us to draw more information from their humor.</p>
