Some humor profiles aren't intuitive
</h1>

    <p>While we find many humor profiles to be intuitive, we often come across humor profiles that are unintuitive:</p>



<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Each week, Brad interacts with the bagger at the store with an intellectual disability.</narration></p> 
   
    <p><narration>The bagger is always blank-faced, polite, and reserved. But today, he seems different. As Brad’s checking out, the bagger introduces himself.</narration> <speech>
   “Hello, I’m Jonas,”</speech> <narration>he says.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Jonas does other things Brad has never seen him do before, like counting the items as he bags them. When he finishes, he asks Brad for the total number of items listed at the bottom of his receipt.</narration> <speech>“I want to check if I’m right,”</speech> <narration>Jonas explains. Finally, Jonas tells Brad that family is coming to visit him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Brad heads out. What was up with Jonas today? He was unusually talkative.</narration></p> 
    </div>

<p>Brad found Jonas’ behavior a bit inscrutable&mdash;but his behavior makes sense when we think about Jonas as expressing humor tells.</p>

<p>Jonas was showing <humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell> <callback>(relative to him)</callback>, <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell> <callback>
(relative to him)</callback>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell> <callback>(relative to him)</callback>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell> <callback>(leaning closer to look at a receipt)</callback>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell> <callback>(introducing himself)</callback>, and so on. Since there are so many humor tells, it’s likely that Jonas was feeling humor.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">
    Jonas also gave collaborating context: he had visitors coming, which probably put him in a good mood. Jonas’ felt that family was visiting was a large mistake with a large OK, and so expressed humor tells.</p>
    </div>

<p>If Brad had known Jonas well for years, Brad would know whether or not Jonas was feeling humor—since Brad would know his humor profile.</p> 

<p>But since Brad <sem-weak>doesn't</sem-weak> know Jonas' humor profile, and doesn't really consider humor as an emotional explanation—Brad feels confused.
</p> 


    <div class="box"> 

<p><headline>Acclimate.</headline> We have to acclimate to <sem>everyone's</sem> humor profiles&mdash;not just with distinctive ones, like Jonas' humor profile.</p>

<p>This is obvious when we think about meeting someone we clicked with. Even though we felt we could read them like a book from the very beginning, we <sem-weak>still</sem-weak> got better and better at reading their emotional state as time went on. That's because we acclimate to <sem-weak>everyone's</sem-weak> humor profile.</p>
