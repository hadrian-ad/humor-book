Humor tells help us think about unusual humor profiles
</h1>

<p>Many people express humor tells in a way that we find intuitive. But other people have humor profiles that aren't immediately intuitive to us.</p>



<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Each week, Brad sees the bagger with an intellectual disability at the grocery store. The bagger is always blank-faced, polite, and reserved. But today, the bagger seems different. As Brad’s checking out, the bagger introduces himself.</narration> <speech>
   “Hello, I’m Jonas,”</speech> <narration>Jonas says.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Jonas does other things Brad has never seen him do before, like counting the items as he bags them. When he finishes, he asks Brad for the total number of items listed at the bottom of his receipt.</narration> <speech>“I want to check if I’m right,”</speech> <narration>Jonas explains. Finally, Jonas tells Brad that family is coming to visit him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Brad heads out. What was up with Jonas today? He was unusually talkative.</narration></p> 
    </div>

<p>Brad found Jonas’ behavior a bit inscrutable—but his behavior makes sense when we think about Jonas as expressing humor tells!</p>

<p>Jonas was showing <humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell> (relative to him), <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell> (relative to him), <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell> (relative to him), <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell> (leaning closer to look at a receipt), <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell> (introducing himself), and so on. Since there are so many humor tells, it’s likely that Jonas was feeling humor.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">
    Jonas also gave a collaborating motive: he had visitors coming, which probably put him in a good mood. Jonas’ felt that family was visiting was a large mistake with a large OK, and so expressed humor tells.</p>
    </div>

<p>If Brad had known Jonas well for years, Brad would know whether or not Jonas was feeling humor—since Brad would know his humor profile.</p>

<p>But since Brad doesn't know <em>Jonas'</em> humor profile—and doesn't really consider humor as an emotional explanation—he feels confused.

 <button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">We acclimate to every humor profile</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX"> 

<p>We have to acclimate to everyone's humor profiles. This is most obvious for people with very distinctive humor profiles, like Jonas—but it's something we do with <em>everyone</em>.</p> 

<p>If a surly-looking (or cheerful-looking) stranger walks into our store, we have to factor in uncertainty—we can't be sure we understand the nuance of a stranger's emotional state from our first glance.</p>

<p>Even if we meet someone we click with, in a way we feel we can read like a book from the very beginning—we still probabl yfound we got better and better at reading their emotional state as time went on. That's because we acclimate to <em>everyone's</em> humor profile—not just ones we find unusual, like Jonas's.</p>
