Humor tells help us think about unusual humor profiles
</h1>

Many people express humor tells in a way that we find intuitive. But other people have humor profiles that aren't immediately intuitive to us.



Each week, Brad sees the bagger with an intellectual disability at the grocery store. The bagger is always blank-faced, polite, and reserved. But today, the bagger seems different. As Brad’s checking out, the bagger introduces himself. “Hello, I’m Jonas,” Jonas says.

Jonas does other things Brad has never seen him do before, like counting the items as he bags them. When he finishes, he asks Brad for the total number of items listed at the bottom of his receipt. “I want to check if I’m right,” Jonas explains. Finally, Jonas tells Brad that family is coming to visit him.

Brad heads out. What was up with Jonas today? He was unusually talkative. 

Brad found Jonas’ behavior a bit inscrutable—but his behavior makes sense when we think about Jonas as expressing humor tells! 

Jonas was showing high energy (relative to him), increased agency (relative to him), non-normative behavior (relative to him), focus on present, social tightening (leaning closer to look at a receipt), social integration (introducing himself), and so on. Since there are so many humor tells, it’s likely that Jonas was feeling humor. 

 > Consider:
Jonas also gave a collaborating motive: he had visitors coming, which probably put him in a good mood—Jonas’ felt that family was visiting was a large mistake with a large OK, and so expressed humor tells.


Brad doesn't know Jonas' humor profile. If Brad's daughter acted like this, Brad would know whether this was how his daughter expressed humor or not. But since Brad doesn't know how Jonas' humor profile, he should consider that this is how he expresses humor.

Acclimate. When we meet new people, we have to acclimate to their humor profiles. This is most obvious with people with very distinctive humor profiles, like Jonas—but it's actually something we do with everyone. 
A stranger may walk into our store and look surly—or be smiling broadly—and we have to factor in the fact that we can't always be sure we understand the nuance of their emotional state from our very first glance.
