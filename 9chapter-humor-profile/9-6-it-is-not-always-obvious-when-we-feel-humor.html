It's not always obvious when we feel humor
</h1>

Sometimes we think our emotions should be obvious—but they're not. We have to catch a flexible pattern that comes at different intensities. 

High-intensity humor can be obvious, but low-intensity humor can happen without us even noticing it:



Alina is watching the crows gather sticks outside her window. She watches them with interest and gently grips her wrist. Inside, she doesn’t have an internal feeling. (<- Alina expresses humor tells, but her humor isn’t obvious to her)



Zoe is watching people play Ultimate on the quad from the window with a half-smile on her face. Inside, she feels nothing at all. Emma sits down next to her.

Emma: Enjoying the view?”

Zoe: *surprised* “Am I? I guess so.” (<- Zoe expresses humor tells, but her humor isn’t obvious to her)



Minh has been texting with Amaya, and puts his phone away before class, thinking about her. He likes thinking about her. When Trevor comes in and sits down at the desk, Minh starts chatting volubly about things, making jokes and smiling. He feels inexpressibly normal.

Trevor: “You’re in a good mood today!”

Minh: “Am I? I guess I am!” *laughs* (<- Minh doesn’t notice he’s in a good mood until it’s pointed out to him)



Jessica appears in her wizard cloak and hat. Emma scoffs. “That’s not exactly professional you know.” Jessica flicks her cape with a roguish smile strides out. (<- Emma’s scoff shows both humor and mistake-predominant emotions, but Emma only considers it as showing a mistake-predominant emotion) 

Alina, Zoe, Minh, and Emma were feeling humor without some abstract "humor-feeling" inside them. In fact, other people were more aware of their humor than they were themselves!

But humor doesn't require our awareness or a "mind-feeling" before it's humor. Instead, if we're showing humor tells, consistent with our overall humor profile, then we're feeling humor.

Feeling. When we feel humor, sometimes have private humor tells—internal physical sensations that usually only we're aware of. Some of these humor tells are:
an upward feeling from our stomach to our head, almost like there’s rising gas or upward internal pressure
a tingling in our cheeks as the muscles tense before or during a smile
a drawback under the skin in our chest,
an uncurtaining feeling in our stomach
an awareness of a specific part of the inside of the head
a shift up or down by our vocal chords
a downward flushing feeling from our cheeks to our lungs
an expansion in the soft palette of our mouth
a twinge in the muscles around our nose
(and so on) 

These private humor tells often what we think of as the “inside feeling” of humor—but they're not one thing (a "feeling"), but just various possible private humor tells. But these humor tells don't need to be present or noticed by us before we experience humor.
