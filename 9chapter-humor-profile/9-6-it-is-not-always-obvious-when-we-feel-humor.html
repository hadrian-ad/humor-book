It's not always obvious when we feel humor
</h1>

<p>Sometimes we think our emotions should be obvious—but they're not always obvious.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Our emotions are flexible and sometimes changing patterns of behavior elements—with each element having many variations and degrees of intensities.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">With so many possible configurations of these patterns, it's not surprising our emotional state isn't always obvious!</p> 
    </div>

<p>And while our <term>high</term>-intensity humor is often obvious to us <callback>(we fall to the floor, laughing)</callback>, <em>low</em>-intensity humor can happen without us even noticing:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Alina is watching the crows gather sticks outside her window. She watches them with interest and gently grips her wrist. Inside, she doesn’t have an internal feeling. </narration><notes>(&larr;Alina expresses humor tells, but her humor isn’t obvious to her)</notes></p>
</div>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is watching people play Ultimate on the quad from the window with a half-smile on her face. Inside, she feels nothing at all. Emma sits down next to her.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>"Enjoying the game?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(surprised)</internalaction> <speech>“Am I? I guess so.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe expresses humor tells, but her humor isn’t obvious to her)</notes></p>

<div class="vignette">
   
    <p><narration>Minh has been texting with Amaya, and puts his phone away before class, thinking about her. He likes thinking about her. When Trevor comes in and sits down at the desk, Minh starts chatting volubly about things, making jokes and smiling. He feels inexpressibly normal—more normal than he's felt in a long time.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <narration>“You’re in a good mood today!”</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <narration>“Am I? I guess I am!”</narration> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Minh doesn’t notice he’s in a good mood until it’s pointed out to him)</notes></p>
    
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
  <p> <narration>Jessica appears in her wizard cloak and hat. Emma scoffs.</narration> <speech>“That’s not exactly professional you know.”</speech> <narration>Jessica flicks her cape with a roguish smile strides out.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s scoff shows both humor and mistake-predominant emotions, but Emma only considers it as showing a mistake-predominant emotion)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>

<p>Alina, Zoe, Minh, and Emma were feeling humor without some abstract "humor-feeling" inside them. In fact, other people were more aware of their humor than they were themselves!</p>

<p>Humor doesn't require our awareness or a "mind-feeling" before it's humor. Instead, if we're showing humor tells, consistent with our overall humor profile, then we're feeling humor.</p>



<div class="box">

<p><headline>Internal humor tells.</headline>We've mostly been talking about <term>external</term> humor tells. But we also can feel <em>internal</em> humor tells—internal physical sensations that usually only we are aware of, like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>an upward feeling from our stomach to our head, almost like there’s rising gas or upward internal pressure</li>
    <li>a tingling in our cheeks as the muscles tense before or during a smile</li>
    <li>a drawback under the skin in our chest</li>
       
       
        <li>an uncurtaining feeling in our stomach</li>
        <li>an awareness of a specific part of the inside of the head</li>
    <li>a shift up or down by our vocal chords</li>
    <li>a downward flushing feeling from our cheeks to our lungs</li>
    <li>an expansion in the soft palette of our mouth</li>
    <li>a twinge in the muscles around our nose</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>When we think of a "feeling" to humor, we're often referring to these internal humor tells.</p> 
    
    <p>But these internal humor tells don't always need to be present or noticed by us in order for us to experience humor—for the same reason <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell> doesn't need to be present or noticed by us in order for us to experience humor.</p>
