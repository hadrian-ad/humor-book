We see more humor by learning about different humor profiles
</h1>

If we meet someone who's gruff and not smiling, the absence of a smile doesn't necessarily mean they're not feeling humor. That's because the importance of a smile depends on their humor profile.
> Consider:
For instance, when Zoe meets her gruff uncle for the first time, she may feel awkward and assume he's always in a bad mood—whether or not he is. But after knowing him for a few years, she'll be comfortable spending time with him, since she'll find it easy to know when he's in a good mood.

Alina is autistic and rarely smiles—and people who don't know her often find the way she expresses her emotional state to be unintuitive:

 

Alina is watching the crows gather sticks outside her window. She watches them with interest and gently grips her wrist.

Is Alina feeling humor, stress, or something else? At first, we might exclude humor, since her emotion tells don't "look" like humor—she's not laughing or grinning.

But she is expressing a few humor tells. She loses wider situational awareness, focuses on present, has high energy (relative to Alina), reduces stress, touches self, and so on. Since she has several humor tells, we can't exclude humor from possibly being in her emotional state.

> Consider:

Whether or not Alina is actually expressing humor depends on her humor profile. If we spent days with Alina, we'd start picking up on her emotional patterns. This would give us more confidence to decide whether Alina is expressing stress or humor, and to what intensity.

Relative. We can’t make precise judgements about the emotional states of people we just met, because humor tells are relative to each person’s humor profile. We have to spend time with someone before we can make relative judgements about their emotions.
For instance, our partner may rarely talk to strangers. We know this, but strangers don't. So we may be amazed that our partner introduced themselves to a stranger on the train (high-intensity social integration relative to them)—but the stranger can't make any relative judgement about the intensity of this humor tell. They don't have any other experiences with that person to relate it to!
