Humor profiles help us see more humor
</h1>

 <p><humor-tell>Smiles</humor-tell> are common ways of expressing humor—but the <sem>significance</sem> of a smile's <term>presence</term> or <em>absence</em> depends on someone's humor profile.</p>
 
<p>For instance, we can feel humor even when we're not smiling:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>When Zoe moved to Pittsburgh for school, her dad was thrilled she'd get to spend more time with her Uncle Jason.</narration> <speech>"He can give you rides!"</speech><narration>, Brad said.</narration></p>
   
    <p><narration>Growing up, Zoe always found him intimidating—he was always silent and had a sour face. But the more she got to know him, the more she found he was almost always surprisingly good-humored.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe acclimates to a humor profile)</notes></p>
</div>
   
<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>When Lisa is first hired at the office, Yasmin and Amber thought she was incredibly uptight. Lisa was always scowling!</narration></p>
   
   <p><narration>But after two years, Yasmin and Amber have a great time working with her. They pick up on Lisa's mood by how fast she walks down the hall, how talkative she is, and the kind of eye-contact she makes.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin acclimates to a humor profile)</notes>
   </p>
   
<p><narration>A new employee confides in Yasmin and Amber that she's intimidated by Lisa's aggressive face. Yasmin and Amber are surprised.</narration></p> 
<p>
    <speaker>Amber:</speaker> <speech>"What?! Lisa's a hoot!"</speech>
</p> 
<p>
    <speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <speech>"You really just have to get to know her!"</speech>

    Emma was originally disturbed by how much her roommate smiled. But after a while, she got used to it. Jessica smiled when she was happy and smiled when she was sad and smiled when she was bored. Emma just had to learn what smile was what. </narration><notes>(&larr;Emma acclimates to a humor profile)</notes></p>

  <div class="vignette">
   <p>
       <narration>Hana sneaks a look across the lab at Alina. Alina is gently gripping her own wrist as she watches the crows gather sticks outside the window.</narration> 
   </p> 
   
   <p><narration>Hana goes back to work, wishing she know more about what Alina was thinking.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Hana hasn't acclimated to Alina's humor profile)</notes></p>
    </div>        

<p>Alina is autistic and rarely smiles—and people who don't know her well often find the way she expresses her emotional state to be unintuitive. For instance, in the example above, is Alina feeling humor or mistake-predominant emotions? 

<p>At first, we might exclude humor, since her emotion tells don't "look" like humor—she's not <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>.</p>

<p>But she <sem-weak>is</sem-weak> doing things we can describe as humor tells. She's <humor-tell>lost wider situational awareness</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focused on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>has high energy</humor-tell> (relative to herself), <humor-tell>reduces stress</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touches self</humor-tell>, and so on. Since she has several humor tells, we can't exclude humor from possibly being in her emotional state.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Whether or not Alina actually felt humor depends on her humor profile. If we spent days with Alina, we'd start picking up on her emotional patterns. This would give us more confidence to decide whether Alina's evaluations are balanced or not—and to what intensity and proportion.</p>

<p><headline>Relativity.</headline> We can’t make precise judgements about the emotional states of people we just met—since humor tells are relative to each person’s humor profile. To make relative judgements about their emotions, we have to give attention to someone over time.</p>

<p>For instance, <term>we</term> may know our partner  rarely talks to strangers, but <em>strangers</em> don't know this. So if our partner introduces themselves to a stranger on the train, we may be amazed at their high-intensity <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell> (relative to them)—but the stranger can't make any judgement about the intensity of this humor tell without more comparative context.</p>
