We see more humor by learning about different humor profiles
</h1>

 <p>Since <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> are common ways of expressing humor, we're often thrown off balance by their absence.</p>

<p>But the significance of a smile's presence or absence depends on someone's humor profile. Just because someone doesn't smile, doesn't mean they're not feeling humor:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>When Zoe moved to Pittsburgh for school, she got to spend more time with her gruff Uncle Jason, who lived nearby and would sometimes give her rides.</narration></p>
   
    <p><narration>At first, she found spending time with him was awkward, since he was so silent and had such a sour face. But by senior year, she was very comfortable chatting and spending time with him.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Sometimes he was sour—but she found out that, more often than not, he was surprisingly good-humored. He had expressive eyebrows and small smiles that she came to find very expressive and welcoming.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe acclimates to a humor profile)</notes></p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>When Lisa is first hired at the office, Yasmin thought she was incredibly uptight. She was always scowling!</narration></p>
   
   <p><narration>But after two years, Yasmin has a great time working with her. She picks up on Lisa's mood by how fast she walks down the hall, how talkative she is, and the kind of eye-contact she makes.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin acclimates to a humor profile)</notes>
   </p>
   
<p><narration>
   
   When a new employee mentions Lisa's aggressive resting face, Yasmin is surprised.</narration></p>

   <p><narration>Emma was originally impressed by how much her roommate smiled. Emma thought Jessica had a blissfully content and happy inner life.</narration></p> 
   
   <p><narration>After a while, Emma came to know that Jessica just smiled a lot—she even smiled when she cried! Emma found her simplistic initial impression of Jessica's smiling wasn't complicated enough. </narration><notes>(&larr;Emma acclimates to a humor profile)</notes></p>

       <narration>Hana sneaks a look across the lab at Alina. Alina is gently gripping her own wrist as she watches the crows gather sticks outside her window.</narration> 
   </p> 
   
   <p><narration>It's a distinctive image. Hana goes back to work, wishing she know more about what Alina was thinking.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Hana hasn't acclimated to Alina's humor profile)</notes></p>
    </div>        

<p>Alina is autistic and rarely smiles—and people who don't know her well often find the way she expresses her emotional state to be unintuitive. In the example above, is Alina feeling humor or mistake-predominant emotions? 

<p>At first, we might exclude humor, since her emotion tells don't "look" like humor—she's not <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>.</p>

<p>But she is doing things we can describe as humor tells. She's <humor-tell>lost wider situational awareness</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focused on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>has high energy</humor-tell> (relative to herself), <humor-tell>reduces stress</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touches self</humor-tell>, and so on. Since she has several humor tells, we can't exclude humor from possibly being in her emotional state.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Whether or not Alina is actually expressing humor depends on her humor profile. If we spent days with Alina, we'd start picking up on her emotional patterns. This would give us more confidence to decide whether Alina is expressing <emotions>stress</emotions> or <emotions>humor</emotions>, and to what intensity and proportion.</p>

<p>The character makes a joke and doesn't smile. But we know she feels humor because we can look for humor tells beyond smiling: she glances toward the other characters (<humor-tell>social seeks</humor-tell>), gives a (light) <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, speaks quickly (<humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>), taps another character on his head (<humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>), swings her arms (<humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>), and breaks off the conversation (<humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell> relative to before the joke).</p>

    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>We can’t make precise judgements about the emotional states of people we just met—since humor tells are relative to each person’s humor profile. To make relative judgements about their emotions, we have to give attention to someone over time.</p>

<p>For instance, <em>we</em> may know our partner  rarely talks to strangers, but <em>strangers</em> don't know this. So if our partner introduces themselves to a stranger on the train, <em>we</em> may be amazed at their high-intensity <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell> (relative to them)—but the stranger can't make any judgement about the intensity of this humor tell without more comparative context.</p>
