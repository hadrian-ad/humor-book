We should notice all intensities of humor
</h1>


<p>Humor tells convey intensity, like how a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> can be low-intensity <callback>(light smile)</callback> or high-intensity <callback>(beaming)</callback>:</p>

<p>Sometimes we only focus on the more-intense half of the spectrum—like broad <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> that crest into <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>. But we should <em>also</em> focus on the less-intense half of the spectrum:</p>

<p>When we see humor everywhere it occurs, we can better understand how people relate to what's happening around them—as well better acclimate to all the various humor profiles around us.</p>

<p>We wouldn't be very good accountants if we didn't realize that cents were money—or if we thought we never had to account for them. Something similar happens with humor.</p> 

<p>If we didn't realize a twinge in our cheeks was a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>—or thought we never had to bother paying attention to these <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>—we would have a blind spot in our observations. When we can instead track and notice these low-intensity variations of a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, we can better pick up nuance and changes in what's happening around us.</p>
