All humor tells have low-intensity variations
</h1>


<p>It's relatively easy to see low-intensity smiles as <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>—a twinge in our cheeks is obviously part of a smile's spectrum of intensity.</p> 

<p>But we can do the same thing for <sem>all</sem> humor tells. So while <term>high</term>-intensity variations of <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell> is often obvious, what does <em>low</em>-intensity variations of this humor tell look like?</p>

<p>We can practice seeing the entire spectrum of a humor tell by thinking about the lowest- and highest- variations of a humor tell:</p>

<h2>spectrum of loss of situational awareness</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        A <term>highest</term>-intensity variation: rolling on the floor, clutching ourselves as we laugh, oblivious to everything.
    </li> 
    
<li>
        A <em>lowest</em>-intensity variation: a blip in our focus—background noises may fade out, or we briefly lose track of our discomfort; when reading we may linger or pause on a word, blink, look up; and so on.
    </li>
    </ul>

<h2>spectrum of social seeking</h2>

<ul>
   <li>
       A <term>highest</term>-intensity variation: racing to find our partner and jumping into the same chair as them, beaming, looking at their face, grabbing their arm.
   </li>
    <li>
        A <em>lowest</em>-intensity variation: someone coming to mind, a faint urge to share something with someone, an increased awareness of who is or isn’t around us, and so on.
    </li>
    </ul>
<h2>spectrum of touching self</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        A <term>highest</term>-intensity variation: crossing our arms, one hand on our face, another on our stomach, legs twisted, bent forward over ourselves.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <em>lowest</em>-intensity variation: using a finger to tap our chin, hair, thigh, or so on.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>spectrum of loosening</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
          A <term>highest</term>-intensity variation: melting into the couch, draping one arm across a cushion and another dangling to the ground below.
    </li>
        
        <li>
            A <em>lowest</em>-intensity variation: adjusting our head; taking a longer breath; repositioning; lowering our shoulders; and so on.
        </li>
</ul>
    
<h2>spectrum of focusing on present</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        A <term>highest</term>-intensity variation: intensely focusing on a video we're watching, completely losing any concern about the past or future or things not nearby.
    </li>
    
<li>
        A <em>lowest</em>-intensity variation: less comparison or contrast with the future or past. For instance, we may have a chore we’re not looking forward to, but the negative anticipation dims somewhat as we focus on the present.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>We already experience or see low-intensity humor in our lives—but we don't always recognize it as "humor" without it being pointed out. </p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">If we laugh loudly and clasp our hands on top of our head, it's obvious to us that this is humor (<humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>). But if we give a short exhale and put a finger on our chin (<humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>), it's <sem>not</sem> always obvious this is humor—even though they both have  the same humor tells!</p>
    </div>

<p>Once we see the full range of a humor tell, we can better notice low-intensity humor as humor.</p>

<p>It also gives us the tools to make better sense of different humor profiles—since each of us expresses low-intensity humor differently. This difference—especially with low-intensity humor—is something we have to acclimate to. </p>



    <div class="box">

<p><headline>What's it like?</headline> So what’s an experience of humor like? It’s not a centralized experience, like touching an object or looking at a mood ring. It’s also not the same experience each time. Instead, we describe humor through patterns that are inclusive to various intensities and durations.</p>

<p>This is why there’s no way to specifically describe what humor is like, for the same reason we can’t describe what a “walk to the store” is like. All walks to the store aren't a single thing we can describe! Since every walk to any store is a bit different each time for everyone, we can only describe patterns and common elements that may make up the experience.</p> 

    </div>


 <div class="chapter-end">
     <p>That's the end of this chapter!</p>
    
      <p>Next, we'll look at how humor is presented in different media.</p>
</div>

    A deeper look (Emotional feelings)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">

    <p>Whenever we combine information together, we have a cognitive rush we call a feeling.


<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p> 
      
      <p class="for-instance-text">We at first <term>can't</term> combine information to read sheet music, financial statements, scientific instruments, debugging reports, game user interface, forest health, and so on.</p> 
      
      <p class="for-instance-text">But once we <em>can</em> take everything in at a glance, the cognitive rush of quickly combining everything together makes up the “feeling” of that activity.</p> 
    </div>
    
<p>

We eventually have a “feeling” when looking over financial statements. But we don’t have this feeling when we start out. Instead, the “feeling” is the feeling of quickly synthesizing bits of information together into what's experienced as a single impression. This means the feeling won't come before we're able to actually do this synthesis!</p>

<p>The same thing happens with emotions. We’ll always be expressing various emotion tells, but that doesn’t mean we'll make sense of them in any particular way.</p>

<p>This is why our emotions aren’t always obvious, especially the first time we come across them. Our first experiences with <emotions>affection</emotions>, <emotions>arousal</emotions>, <emotions>grief</emotions>, <emotions>love</emotions>, <emotions>jealousy</emotions>, <emotions>shame</emotions>, and so on are often confusing to us. We often don’t recognize what was going on until later. It takes awareness and practice for something like "jealousy" to cohere as a feeling.</p>

<p>That's because it's not until we interpret many emotion tells at a glance that we'll have the "feeling" of being jealous—since the feeling of <emotions>jealousy</emotions> is actually the feeling of quickly interpreting and synthesizing emotion tells together.</p> 

<p>We were still expressing emotion tells for our early experiences with our first experiences with <emotions>affection</emotions>, <emotions>arousal</emotions>, <emotions>grief</emotions>, <emotions>love</emotions>, <emotions>jealousy</emotions>, <emotions>shame</emotions>, and so on—we just didn’t put them together in a way that had an overarching feeling.</p> 

<p>This is often a new way of thinking about emotions. We often learn simplistic models of emotions early in life, and aren't presented with alternative models as we grow older to keep pace with our broadening understanding. But there are good reasons to have a variety of emotional models at our disposal.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">In our model of emotions, we express more low-intensity humor tells than we're currently interpreting <callback>(“feeling”)</callback> as humor. That means there's low-hanging fruit to increasing the humor in our lives—simply <term>noticing</term> our low-intensity humor tells <em>as</em> humor! </p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we practice registering these low-intensity humor tells—blips of focus, twinges in our cheeks, exhales, and so on—and consciously composite these humor tells together as humor, we’ll start “feeling humor” where we didn’t before. We do this by becoming aware of the humor we already experience.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">This is especially useful during times that don't otherwise feel that interesting or exciting&mdash;like when waiting around. As we'll talk about later, these moments of low-intensity humor can be sparks we can cultivate into more humor.</p>
</div>
    
<p>A variety of models of emotions doesn't just help us understand <term>ourselves</term> better&mdash;it also helps us understand <em>others</em> better. We can better track the evaluatory responses people make to the world around them, and make more sense of how they describe their emotional experiences.</p>

More examples. For more examples on humor profiles and humor tells, see this chapter's appendix.

Are emotions feelings? We often think emotions are an "interior feeling," and it can be strange to think about emotions as happening without this feeling. We can read this chapter's interval for more context on this interior feeling.
