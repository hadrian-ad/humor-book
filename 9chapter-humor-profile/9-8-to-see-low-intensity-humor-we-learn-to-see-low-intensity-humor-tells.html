To see low-intensities of humor, we learn to see low-intensities of humor tells
</h1>


It's relatively easy to see low-intensity smiles as smiles—a twinge in our cheeks is obviously part of a smile's spectrum of intensity. 

But we can do the same thing for all humor tells. For instance, high-intensity variations of loss of situational awareness is often obvious. But what do a low-intensity variations of this humor tell look like?

We can practice seeing the entire spectrum of a humor tell by thinking about the lowest- and highest- variations of a humor tell:

spectrum of loss of situational awareness

A highest-intensity variation: rolling on the floor, clutching ourselves as we laugh, oblivious to everything. 
A lowest-intensity variation: a blip in our focus—background noises may fade out, or we briefly lose track of our discomfort; when reading we may linger or pause on a word, blink, look up; and so on.

social seeking

A highest-intensity variation: racing to find our partner and jumping into the same chair as them, beaming, looking at their face, grabbing their arm.
A lowest-intensity variation: someone coming to mind, a faint urge to share something with someone, an increased awareness of who is or isn’t around us, and so on.
touching self

A highest-intensity variation: crossing our arms, one hand on our face, another on our stomach, legs twisted, bent forward over ourselves.
A lowest-intensity variation: using a finger to tap our chin, hair, thigh, or so on.
loosening

A highest-intensity variation: melting into the couch, draping one arm across a cushion and another dangling to the ground below.
A lowest-intensity variation: adjusting our head; taking a longer breath; repositioning; lowering our shoulders; and so on.
focusing on present

A highest-intensity variation: intensely focusing on a video we're watching, completely losing any concern about the past or future or things not nearby.

A lowest-intensity variation: less comparison or contrast with the future or past. For instance, we may have a chore we’re not looking forward to, but the negative anticipation dims somewhat as we focus on the present.
We already experience or see low-intensity humor in our lives—but we don't always recognize it as "humor" without it being pointed out. 

> Consider:

For instance, if we laugh loudly and clasp our hands on top of our head, it's obvious to us that this is humor (laugh, touching self). But if we give a short exhale and put a finger on our chin (laugh, touching self), it's not always obvious this is humor—even though it has the same humor tells!

Once we see the full range of a humor tell, we can better notice low-intensity humor as humor.

It also gives us the tools to make better sense of different humor profiles, since each of us expresses low-intensity humor differently and is something we have to acclimate to.

Experience. So what’s an experience of humor like? It’s not a centralized experience, like touching an object or looking at a mood ring. It’s also not the same experience each time. Instead, we describe humor through patterns that are inclusive to various intensities and durations.
This is why there’s no way to specifically describe what humor is like, for the same reason we can’t describe what a “walk to the store” is like. A walk to the store isn’t a specific thing we can describe! Every walk to every store is a bit different each time for everyone—so we can only describe patterns and common elements that may make up the experience.

That's the end of this chapter. Well done! 

Next, we'll look at spectator entertainment. 

More examples. For more examples on humor profiles and humor tells, see this chapter's appendix.

Are emotions feelings? We often think emotions are an "interior feeling," and it can be strange to think about emotions as happening without this feeling. We can read this chapter's interval for more context on this interior feeling.

End of chapter summary: Humor tells are reaction elements that, when they co-occur, compose humor. On a population level, we can find average humor tells. But we can also find average humor tells at an individual level too. These are the statistics of how someone individually expresses humor. We call this their "humor profile."


Everyone has a unique humor profile. The more we acclimate to someone's individual humor profile, the more information we can draw about their emotional state.

We have to acclimate to all humor profiles, but especially outlier ones. Many people express humor in subtle or idiosyncratic ways. This means we can avoid jumping to conclusions about their emotional state.

Humor profiles are influenced by various factors around us. This is why they vary time-by-time, place-by-place, person-by-person. But even when humor is expressed differently, it's still always made up through the same collection of reaction elements.

Humor tell are humor. We often think that a smile expresses a "feeling" of humor, and the feeling is the "true" humor. But in this book, there's no core, single "feeling" of humor. Instead, there are decentralized humor tells that can occur in various combination throughout our body and behavior. These together make up humor, whether or not there's some kind of internal feeling.
