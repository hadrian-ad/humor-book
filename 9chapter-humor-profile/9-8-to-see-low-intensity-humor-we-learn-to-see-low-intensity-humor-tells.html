There are low-intensity variations to all humor tells
</h1>


<p>It's relatively easy to see low-intensity smiles as <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>—a twinge in our cheeks is obviously part of a smile's spectrum of intensity.</p> 

<p>But we can do the same thing for <sem>all</sem> humor tells. So while <term>high-intensity</term> variations of <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell> is often obvious&mdash;what does <em>low-intensity</em> variations of this humor tell look like?</p>

<img src="../images/9c-images-humor-profile/9-8-to-see-low-intensity-humor-we-learn-to-see-low-intensity-humor-tells/9-8-0.png"

title="What do lower intensities of humor tells look like?"
alt="This image has two spectrum plots, both with less and more intense humor at either end. The top spectrum has the 'more intense' half circled, and an annotation says these humor tells are often obvious. Below that, the annotation asks 'but what do they look like at lower intensities?', with an arrow toward the 'less intense' spectrum."
style="max-width:; margin-left:"

<p>We can practice seeing the entire spectrum of a humor tell by thinking about the lowest- <sem>and</sem> highest- variations of a humor tell:</p>

<h2>spectrum of loss of situational awareness</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: rolling on the floor, clutching ourselves as we laugh, oblivious to everything.
    </li> 
    
<li>
        A <em>lowest-intensity</em> variation: a blip in our focus; background noises may fade out, or we briefly lose track of our discomfort; when reading we may linger or pause on a word, blink, look up; and so on.
    </li>
    </ul>

title="Complete spectrum of the humor tell 'loss of situational awareness'"
alt="This spectrum plot for the humor tell 'loss of situational awareness has a 'blip in our focus' on the less intense end, and 'rolling on the floor' on the more intense end. An annotation says 'loss of situational is everything between these two ends of intensities."
style="max-width:; margin-left:"
>

<h2>spectrum of social seeking</h2>

<ul>
   <li>
       A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: racing to find our partner and jumping into the same chair as them, beaming, looking at their face, grabbing their arm.
   </li>
    <li>
        A <em>lowest-intensity</em> variation: someone coming to mind, a faint urge to share something with someone, an increased awareness of who is or isn’t around us, and so on.
    </li>
    </ul>
<h2>spectrum of touching self</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: crossing our arms, one hand on our face, another on our stomach, legs twisted, bent forward over ourselves.
    </li>
    <li>
        A <em>lowest-intensity</em> variation: using a finger to tap our chin, hair, thigh, or so on.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>spectrum of loosening</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
          A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: melting into the couch, draping one arm across a cushion and another dangling to the ground below.
    </li>
        
        <li>
            A <em>lowest-intensity</em> variation: adjusting our head; taking a longer breath; repositioning; lowering our shoulders; and so on.
        </li>
</ul>
    
<h2>spectrum of focusing on present</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: intensely focusing on a video we're watching, completely losing any concern about the past or future or things not nearby.
    </li>
    
<li>
        A <em>lowest-intensity</em> variation: less comparison or contrast with the future or past. For instance, we may have a chore we’re not looking forward to, but the negative anticipation dims somewhat as we focus on the present.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>We already experience or see low-intensity humor in our lives—but we don't always recognize it as "humor" without it being pointed out. </p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">If we laugh loudly and clasp our hands on top of our head, it's obvious to us that this is humor (<humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>). But if we give a short exhale and put a finger on our chin (<humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>), it's <sem>not</sem> always obvious this is humor—even though they both have  the same humor tells!</p>
    </div>

<p>Once we see the full range of a humor tell, we can better notice low-intensity humor as humor.</p>

<img src="../images/9c-images-humor-profile/9-8-to-see-low-intensity-humor-we-learn-to-see-low-intensity-humor-tells/9-8-2.png"

title="All intensities of humor are 'humor'"
alt="This spectrum plot has two places marked, on toward the less intense end and the other toward the more intense end. An annotation notes that a collection of humor tells on either end are both 'humor,' just at different intensities."
style="max-width:; margin-left:"

<p>It also gives us the tools to make better sense of different humor profiles—since each of us expresses low-intensity humor differently.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">The lowest-hanging fruit to feeling more humor is&mdash;to notice the humor we already feel! Once we recognize blips in our focus as very low-intensity humor, we have sparks of humor to play with.

    <div class="box">

<p><headline>What's it like?</headline> So what’s an experience of humor like? It’s not a centralized experience, like touching an object or looking at a mood ring. It’s also not the same experience each time. Instead, we describe humor through patterns that are inclusive to various intensities and durations.</p>

<p>This is why there’s no way to specifically describe what humor is like, for the same reason we can’t describe what a “walk to the store” is like. All walks to the store aren't a single thing we can describe! Since every walk to any store is a bit different each time for everyone, we can only describe patterns and common elements that may make up the experience.</p>

    A deeper look (Emotions)

<div class="content-example">

         
<p>Since we grew up with words like "humor" and "emotions," we often find it hard to imagine a world without them&mdash;a bit like imagining a world without words like "tree" or "clouds."</p>

<p>But surprisingly, <sem>both</sem> <term>humor</term> and <em>emotions</em> are relatively new words. Their modern meanings didn't actually exist for most of history in any language.</p>

<p>Let's go over a quick history of both of these words:</p>


<h2>Humor</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <p>"Humor" originally meant <callback>"juice of a plant or animal."</callback> So we can squeeze the humors from apples <callback>(apple juice)</callback>, and squirrels are full of squirrel humors.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">
             Words like <sem-weak>humor, humid, humidify, humidor, humus,</sem-weak> and so on all share the same root&mdash;of <callback>"moist, wet."</callback>
         </p>
         </div>    
    <p>Humor didn't have any association with laughter at all, for the same reason <callback>"juice"</callback> doesn't have association with laughter today.</p>
    
    <p>It wasn't until just a few hundred years ago that the word "humor" started being used not for <term>laughter</term> specifically but for <em>emotions</em> generally. That's when the word "humor" was used for the English translation of a longstanding personality modeling system.</p>
    
    <p>This personality modeling system used a terminology of human "juices." It became immensely popular, and it's terminology became universal.</p>
            
    <p>Eventually, the combininations of fluids <callback>(humor<outcome-contrast>s</outcome-contrast> specifically)</callback> was seen as an extraneous step, and "humor" started to directly mean something like "malleable medium of disposition" <callback>(humor generally)</callback>, often with a capricious subtext. <callback>("The king's humor," "The baby was in bad humor yesterday, but is in good humor today!”)</callback></p>
    
    <p>Over the next two hundred years or so, the meaning of humor shifted from "the malleable medium of disposition" into all the things it also means today.</p>
    
    <p>The modern meanings of "humor" tend to relate from different angles to laughter&mdash;including humor's overlapping meanings like <callback>"laughter,"</callback> <callback>"cause of laughter,"</callback> <callback>"weirdness associated with what sometimes causes laughter,"</callback> <callback>"laughter associated with weirdness,"</callback> <callback>"jokes in general,"</callback> <callback>"interpersonal ability to generate laughter,"</callback> <callback>"a feeling associated with laughter,"</callback> and so on.</p> 

    <p>These modern meanings coexist with older meanings, making the word a very broad tent&mdash;a word that shrunk from a very general meaning to a more specific one.</p> 
      
<div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
                    
        <p class="for-instance-text">When we want it to, the word "humor" can still easily carry poetic notes of sadness, madness, rejection, capriciousness, emotional medium, energy, and so on. <callback>("The sisters engaged in periodic bouts of plaintive humor.")</callback></p> 
        
    </div>
            
        </div>

<!--
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">It's easy to look down on the "four humors" as nonsense. However, it's also worth not giving the past a double standard&mdash;it's not that different from personality modeling systems today. We know from our own time that these systems have language that have become inescabable <callback>(extrovert, introvert)</callback> no matter what we think of them or their original systems.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">In the same way, humorous <callback>("juice")</callback> words like "melancholy" or "sanquine" also became inescapable as a shared idiom in previous centuries, which doesn't immediately tell us what individuals would have thought about systems those words came from.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Finally, we can think of more charitable interpretations. If we think of "humor" as not literally "juice," but metaphorically "flavor" or "tone"&mdash;we arrive at gentler understanding of their language.</p> </div>
-->

<h2>Emotion</h2> 
<div class="h2">
    <p>The word “emotion” was originally just a variation of the word “motion.” Like <term>(e)rupture</term> and <term>rupture</term>, <em>(e)motion</em> was just <em>motion</em> with an emphatic or expelling <sem-weak>e-</sem-weak> in front. 
    
    <p>This is why early uses of emotion were about <sem>motion</sem>:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>an earthquake was e-motion in the ground <callback>(the ground shakes, has motion)</callback></li>
        <li>an audience pouring out of the stadium was e-motion in the crowd <callback>(they moved together, com-motion)</callback></li>
        <li>a letter could cause a reader’s e-motion <callback>(like pacing, from internal feelings)</callback></li></ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>From there, the word eventually developed into its current sense of<callback>“cogitated feelings, especially strong ones (that cause movement or expressive action).”</callback></p> 
    
    <p>Sometimes, we use the word “emotion” expansively beyond movement&mdash;like to refer to all inner life. But the meaning of “emotion” constantly drifts back to motion.</p>
           
  <p>If a director says <callback>“let’s do the scene again, this time with more EMOTION!”</callback>—they don’t mean more vivid internal sensations. The director mean more <sem-weak>emoting</sem-weak>, more expressive action in the body and face. </p>
       
<p>Similarly, we call cats emotionless, not because cats don't have feelings, moods, opinions, personality, preferences, reactions, and so on, because they obviously do&mdash;but because their faces don’t move. Cats can’t emote in the same way dogs can with their moving <callback>(emotional)</callback> faces. </p>
    
<div class="consider">
       
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
        <p class="considertext">It's the same for people. When a novelist describes someone as "emotionless" they often mean they have a stony poker face <callback>("motionless")</callback>&mdash; not that there's nothing happening inside them.</p>
        
        <!--
        <p class="considertext">Similarly, we think of stormy seas and blowing trees as emotional, where it's the motion that gives power to the analogy to human emotion.  </p>
-->
    </div>
  
     <!--   
     <p>This association with movement is one reason emotion sometimes struggles to encompass everything we want it to&mdash;including things like intentions due to mood or tone of reflections. </p>
     -->
    </div> 

<p>"Humor" and "emotion" took on new meanings together because of a popular metaphor that caught several words in its wake, giving them new meanings&mdash;the metaphor that <term>reactions and interpretations</term> were <em>liquid</em>.</p>

<p>Since <term>humors</term> <callback>(liquids)</callback> were particularly <em>emotional</em> <callback>(fluid)</callback>, they both suited these metaphorical descriptions of human experiences. Our evaluatory nature infused us like sap or blood&mdash;mixed and behaved like liquids in a container&mdash;had flavors or properties as they mixed&mdash;and could be expelled or drained in some way.</p>
<p>


<p>This popular metaphor is why these two words, humor and emotion, changed together from literally describing <term>fluids</term> and <term>movement</term> to metaphorically describing <em>cause of laughter</em> and <em>feelings</em>.</p>  

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We have plenty of remenants of this metaphor cluster, like when we talk about emotions as something we are <sem-weak>"filled with"</sem-weak> that can be <sem-weak>"let out"</sem-weak> or <sem-weak>"expelled."</sem-weak></p>
    
    <p class="considertext">
        This way of speaking wouldn't have had as much power with older ways of describing experiences, like Latin's <callback>affect</callback>. Affect meant <sem-weak>"to have done to,"</sem-weak> <sem-weak>"to have been connected in such a way."</sem-weak>
    </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If a view affected us <callback>(with beauty)</callback>, there's nothing to expel or let out&mdash;since their model of experiences and evaluations was not based on a metaphor of internal fluids.</p> 
    
    </div>
    
    <!--
    <p class="considertext">These metaphors replaced the Latin word for emotion <callback>(affect)</callback>, which meant <sem-weak>"to have done to,"</sem-weak> <sem-weak>"to have been connected in such a way."</sem-weak></p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">The replacement of <term>affect</term> <callback>(done to us; out-to-in)</callback> with <em>emotions/humor</em> <callback>(happens within us; in-to-out)</callback> also upturned and outdated many traditional affect-affilated words, like <sem-weak>merry</sem-weak> <callback>(something that causes enjoyement out-to-in, "merry weather")</callback>.</p>
-->
        



<p>The point of all this is to give us some distance from the modern sense of these words. These words dominate how we think about ourselves, even when they're often confusing&mdash;we don't always realize we can set them down for a while!</p> 

<p>When we can step back and accept that these words are a bit strange, nebulous, and inconsistent today&mdash;we have more freedom to treat these words as one tool in our bigger toolbox in think about ourselves, and not the <sem>only</sem> tool.
</p>


<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Slang.</headline> The modern meaning of "humor" is kind of slangy. This helps us understand what kind of word we're dealing with. We can feel the slanginess of "humor" by imagining that we're saying "juice” instead of humor:</p> 
        
        <ul class="close-list">
         <li>“he just has a great sense of juice about him”</li>
         <li>“that movie has great juice”</li> 
         <li>"it's juice that makes life worth living!"</li>
        <li>“just juice him, it's not worth the conflict”</li> 
        </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
        
        
    <p>One way of thinking about "slang" is that the meaning doesn't match its etymology. This gives some context to a new word like humor <callback>("moistness")</callback>, which often feels categorically different to more durable emotional words:</p>    
    
<ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            <sem-weak>anger, anxiety, angina,</sem-weak> and so on come from the root for <sem-weak>"painful, painfully constricted"</sem-weak>
        </li>
            
    <li>    <sem-weak>grief, grave, aggravate,</sem-weak> and so on come from the root of <sem-weak>"heavy"</sem-weak>
               </li>         
        
        <li>
            <sem-weak>love</sem-weak> comes from the root for <sem-weak>"care, love" </sem-weak>
        </li>
    </ul>
         
         <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
         
         <p>These words have been stable for thousands of years! By comparison, "juice" exists in a different neighborhood.</p>
         
                 <p>That doesn't mean humor is less important or meaningful than those other words. It just means it has characteristics that we have to take into account when thinking about it.</p>
          </div> 
      </div>

   
   
   <!--
    <p>Whenever we combine information together, we have a cognitive rush we call a feeling.


<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p> 
      
      <p class="for-instance-text">At first we <term>can't</term> combine information to read sheet music, financial statements, scientific instruments, debugging reports, game user interface, forest health, and so on.</p> 
      
      <p class="for-instance-text">But once we <em>can</em> take everything in at a glance, the cognitive rush of quickly combining everything together makes up the “feeling” of that activity.</p> 
    </div>
    
<p>

We eventually have a “feeling” when looking over financial statements&mdash;but we don’t have this feeling when we start out. Instead, the “feeling” is the feeling of quickly synthesizing bits of information together into what's experienced as a single impression. This means the feeling won't come before we're able to actually do this synthesis!</p>

<p>The same thing happens with interpreting emotions. We’ll always be expressing various emotion tells, but that doesn’t mean we'll make sense of them in any particular way.</p>

<p>This is why our emotions aren’t always obvious, especially the first time we come across them. Our first experiences with <emotions>affection</emotions>, <emotions>arousal</emotions>, <emotions>grief</emotions>, <emotions>love</emotions>, <emotions>jealousy</emotions>, <emotions>shame</emotions>, and so on are often confusing to us&mdash;and we often don’t recognize what was going on until later. It takes awareness and practice for something like "jealousy" to cohere as a feeling.</p>

<p>That's because it's not until we interpret many emotion tells at a glance that we'll have the "feeling" of being jealous—since the feeling of <emotions>jealousy</emotions> is actually the feeling of quickly interpreting and synthesizing emotion tells together.</p> 

<p>We were still expressing emotion tells for our early experiences with our first experiences with <emotions>affection</emotions>, <emotions>arousal</emotions>, <emotions>grief</emotions>, <emotions>love</emotions>, <emotions>jealousy</emotions>, <emotions>shame</emotions>, and so on—we just didn’t put them together in a way that had an overarching feeling.</p> 

<p>This is often a new way of thinking about emotions. We often learn simplistic models of emotions early in life, and aren't presented with alternative models as we grow older to keep pace with our broadening understanding. But there are good reasons to have a variety of emotional models at our disposal.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">In our model of emotions, we express more low-intensity humor tells than we're currently interpreting <callback>(“feeling”)</callback> as humor. That means there's low-hanging fruit to increasing the humor in our lives&mdash;which is simply to <term>notice</term> our low-intensity humor tells <em>as</em> humor! </p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we practice registering these low-intensity humor tells&mdash;blips of focus, twinges in our cheeks, exhales, and so on&mdash;and composite these humor tells together as humor, we’ll start “feeling humor” where we didn’t before. We do this by becoming aware of the humor we already experience.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">This is especially useful during times that don't otherwise feel that interesting or exciting&mdash;like when waiting around. As we'll talk about later, these moments of low-intensity humor can be sparks we can cultivate into more humor.</p>
</div>
    
<p>A variety of models of emotions doesn't just help us understand <term>ourselves</term> better&mdash;it also helps us understand <em>others</em> better. We can better track the evaluatory responses people have, and make more sense of how they describe their emotional experiences.</p>
