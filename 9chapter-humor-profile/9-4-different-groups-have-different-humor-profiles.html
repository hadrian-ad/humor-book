Humor profiles vary by groups
</h1>

<p>Our humor profile is shaped by when and where we grew up, and who we spent time with. This is why part of why humor profiles very person-by-person—but also decade-by-decade, group-by-group, region-by-region, and so on.</p>

<p>We can see this in a humorous Soviet travelogue from 1936. Two authors took a car trip across the United States, and they satirized the distinctive way they saw Americans laughing and smiling:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p>[The travelers write:] American laughter, generally good, loud, and lively laughter, occasionally does irritate. Let us suppose that two Americans meet.</p>
    
    <p>First American: (Smiling) …</p>
    
    <p>Second American: (Showing part of his teeth)</p> …
    
    <p>First American: How are you? (Laughs)</p>
    
    <p>Second American: Very well, thank you! (Shows all of his thirty-two teeth, among which are three gold ones.) And how are you?</p>
    
    <p>First American: Very well! Fine! (Laughs loudly). How is business?</p>
    
    <p>Second American: Good! (Laughs uproariously.) And yours?</p>
    
    <p>First American: Excellent! (Laughs wildly.) Well, good-bye, regards to your wife!</p>
    
    <p>Second American: Thank you! Ha, ha, ha! Regard to yours! (Emitting an entire waterfall of laughter, he slaps First American on the shoulder with all his might.) Good-bye!</p>
    
    <p>First American: (shaking with laughter slaps Second American on the shoulder) Good-bye! (Each goes to his automobile, and they part, driving off in different directions at terrific speed.)</p>
    </div>
    
<p>The authors are making an observation about regional humor profiles—they sometimes found North American humor profiles to be annoying, bizarre, distinctive, excessive, and so on, in part because they were contrasting those humor profiles with humor profiles from parts of Europe and Asia.</p> 

<p>But even though humor can be expressed differently in different places, the underlying model of mistakes and OKs is still exactly the same—so even when humor’s outward expression varies, the humor still occurs through the same process.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">The authors might not laugh loudly and slap each other on the back when they meet a friend, like how they described Americans doing. But when the authors do meet or make friends in their travelogue, they felt connection and belonging—and would touch each other, socially tighten (like by sitting around a table and leaning in to talk), social seek (by looking at each other) raise their voices, lose situational awareness, and so on—recognizable humor tells expressed through their humor profiles.</p></div>

<p>The authors would feel humor for the same reason anyone feels humor—mistakes and OKs. The system of humor itself is the same, even if there are differences in how humor is expressed, and how we evaluate things.</p>

<p>This means we can adjust our list of humor tells to fit our observations of the people around us. While humor is always expressed with some core similarities, our list of humor tells isn’t meant to be the single standard way humor has been expressed by everyone, at all times.</p> 


<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Regional variations to humor</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>Sometimes, a "sense of humor" seems to be different in different regions or groups. This is due to a both regional variation in humor profiles (touching self may include backslapping here but not there), as well as regional variation in baseline evaluations.</p> 

<p>For instance, if people in our region frequently make biting jokes to each other, we’ll grow up expecting these comments. We’ll also learn that there’s no consequences to them, especially since we’ve grown up knowing how to handle them. In this case, biting jokes are medium mistakes that match medium OKs—and we’ll feel humor.</p> 

<p>But our friend will have a different experience when they visit our region. A biting comment will seem unexpected—and seen as potentially having negative personal consequences, especially if we don't know how to handle them. In this case, we'll have large mistakes with small OKs around the biting jokes—and we wouldn't feel humor.</p>

<p>Since humor is part of how we group and feel good around each other, we can sometimes experience a kind of chronic humor fatigue when we relocate—like if we find a region’s humor too soft or too hard—or if everyone smiles and we’re not used to it. </p>

<p>But even though these “senses of humor” are different group-by-group, family-by-family, time-by-time, it’s still the same system of mistakes and OKs, and still expressed through humor tells.
