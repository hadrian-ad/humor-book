Humor profiles vary by groups
</h1>

<p>Our humor profile is shaped by when and where we grew up. This is part of why humor profiles very not just person-by-person&mdash;but also time-by-time, group-by-group, region-by-region, and so on.</p>

<p>We can see this in a humorous Soviet travelogue from 1936, where two authors took a car trip across the United States. They satirize the distinctive way they saw Americans laughing and smiling:</p>

<div class="vignette">
  <p> <narration>Artem is reading <book-title>Little Golden America</book-title>:</narration></p> 
   
     <p class="bookquote"><narration>[The travelers write:] American laughter, generally good, loud, and lively laughter, occasionally does irritate. Let us suppose that two Americans meet.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">First American: <action>(Smiling)</action> <speech>…</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">Second American: <action>(Showing part of his teeth)</action> <speech>…</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">First American: <speech>How are you?</speech> <action>(Laughs)</action></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">Second American: <speech>Very well, thank you!</speech> <action>(Shows all of his thirty-two teeth, among which are three gold ones.)</action> <speech>And how are you?</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">First American: <speech>Very well! Fine!</speech> <action>(Laughs loudly.)</action> <speech>How is business?</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">Second American: <speech>Good!</speech> <action>(Laughs uproariously.)</action> <speech>And yours?</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">First American: <speech>Excellent!</speech> <action>(Laughs wildly.)</action> <speech>Well, good-bye, regards to your wife!</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">Second American: <speech>Thank you! Ha, ha, ha! Regard to yours!</speech> <action>(Emitting an entire waterfall of laughter, he slaps First American on the shoulder with all his might.)</action> <speech>Good-bye!</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote">First American: <action>(shaking with laughter slaps Second American on the shoulder)</action> <speech>Good-bye!</speech> <action>(Each goes to his automobile, and they part, driving off in different directions at terrific speed.)</action></p>
    
    <p><narration>Artem leans back and imagines what it would be like to talk to people from a hundred years ago.</narration></p>
        
    </div>
    
<p>The authors are making an observation about <sem>regional</sem> humor profiles: they sometimes found North American humor profiles to be annoying, bizarre, distinctive, excessive, and so on&mdash;in part because they contrasted those humor profiles with humor profiles from parts of Europe and Asia.</p> 

<p>But even if the <term>expression</term> of humor varies, the <em>process</em> of humor is the same. Though evaluations themselves and humor tells are different in different places and times, the underlying model of mistakes and OKs is still  the same.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">The authors might not laugh loudly and slap each other on the back when they meet a friend, like how they described Americans doing.</p>
    
     <p class="for-instance-text">But when the authors <sem>do</sem> meet or make friends in their travelogue, they felt <emotions>connection</emotions> and <emotions>belonging</emotions>&mdash;and would <humor-tell>touch each other</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>socially tighten</humor-tell> <callback>(like by sitting around a table and leaning in to talk)</callback>, <humor-tell>social seek</humor-tell> <callback>(by looking at each other)</callback> <humor-tell>raise their voices</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>lose situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on&mdash;recognizable humor tells expressed through their humor profiles.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">The authors would feel humor for the same reason anyone feels humor&mdash;their mistakes and OKs balanced. The system of humor itself is the same, even when humor is expressed in different ways.</p>

</div>





    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Regional variation.</headline> If people in our region frequently make biting comments to each other, we’ll grow up expecting biting comments. We’ll also learn that there’s no consequences to them, especially since we’ve grown up knowing how to handle them. In this case, biting comments are medium mistakes that match medium OKs&mdash;and we’ll feel humor.</p> 

<p>But if our <term>friend</term> visits our region for the first time, a biting comment will seem <em>unexpected</em>&mdash;and be seen as having potentially negative personal consequences, especially if they don't know how to handle them. In this case, the biting comment will give our friend large mistakes with small OKs&mdash;and they wouldn't feel humor.</p>

<p>But even though these “senses of humor” are different group-by-group, family-by-family, time-by-time, it’s still the same system of mistakes and OKs, and still expressed through humor tells.

   <!--
   <p>Since humor is part of how we group and feel good around each other, we can sometimes experience isolation when we relocate somewhere much different&mdash;or even when we spend time with people of much different ages than us.</p>
