Humor profiles vary by groups
</h1>

<p>Our humor profile is shaped by when and where we grew up. This is why part of why humor profiles very not just person-by-person—but also decade-by-decade, group-by-group, region-by-region, and so on.</p>

<p>We can see this in a humorous Soviet travelogue from 1936, where two authors took a car trip across the United States. They satirize the distinctive way they saw Americans laughing and smiling:</p>

<div class="vignette">
  <p> <narration>Artem is reading Little Golden America:</narration></p> 
   
     <p class="bookquote"><narration>[The travelers write:] American laughter, generally good, loud, and lively laughter, occasionally does irritate. Let us suppose that two Americans meet.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>First American:</speaker> <action>(Smiling)</action> <speech>…</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Second American:</speaker> <action>(Showing part of his teeth)</action> <speech>…</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>First American:</speaker> <speech>How are you?</speech> <action>(Laughs)</action></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Second American:</speaker> <speech>Very well, thank you!</speech> <action>(Shows all of his thirty-two teeth, among which are three gold ones.)</action> <speech>And how are you?</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>First American:</speaker> <speech>Very well! Fine!</speech> <action>(Laughs loudly.)</action> <speech>How is business?</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Second American:</speaker> <speech>Good!</speech> <action>(Laughs uproariously.)</action> <speech>And yours?</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>First American:</speaker> <speech>Excellent!</speech> <action>(Laughs wildly.)</action> <speech>Well, good-bye, regards to your wife!</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Second American:</speaker> <speech>Thank you! Ha, ha, ha! Regard to yours!</speech> <action>(Emitting an entire waterfall of laughter, he slaps First American on the shoulder with all his might.)</action> <speech>Good-bye!</speech></p>
    
    <p class="bookquote"><speaker>First American:</speaker> <action>(shaking with laughter slaps Second American on the shoulder)</action> <speech>Good-bye!</speech> <action>(Each goes to his automobile, and they part, driving off in different directions at terrific speed.)</action></p>
    
    <p><narration>Artem leans back and imagines what it would be like to talk to people from a hundred years ago.</narration></p>
        
    </div>
    
<p>The authors are making an observation about <term>regional</term> humor profiles: they sometimes found North American humor profiles to be annoying, bizarre, distinctive, excessive, and so on—in part because they were contrasting those humor profiles with humor profiles from parts of Europe and Asia.</p> 

<p>But the <em>process</em> of humor is the same, even if its expression has variations. The underlying model of mistakes and OKs is still exactly the same, even though evaluations and humor tells are different in different places.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">The authors might not laugh loudly and slap each other on the back when they meet a friend, like how they described Americans doing.</p>
    
     <p class="for-instance-text">But when the authors <em>do</em> meet or make friends in their travelogue, they felt <emotions>connection</emotions> and <emotions>belonging</emotions>—and would <humor-tell>touch each other</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>socially tighten</humor-tell> (like by sitting around a table and leaning in to talk), <humor-tell>social seek</humor-tell> (by looking at each other) <humor-tell>raise their voices</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>lose situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on—recognizable humor tells expressed through their humor profiles.</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">The authors would feel humor for the same reason anyone feels humor—mistakes and OKs. The system of humor itself is the same, even if there are differences in how humor is expressed, and how we evaluate things.</p>

</div>

<p>This means we can adjust our list of humor tells to fit our observations of the people around us. While humor is always expressed with some core similarities, our list of humor tells isn’t meant to be the single standard way humor has been expressed by everyone, at all times.</p> 

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example">Picture example</button>
    
    <div class="content-example">

<p>The above portrait is of some people living in the Russian Empire in 1914. We can use this picture to think about how humor tells are identifiably the same, even though humor tells are shaped by circumstances.</p>

<p>The men in the middle feel relatively intense humor—we can see this from their <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell> (relative to the others), <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell> (by crossing legs or putting hands in lap or on legs), <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>brightened</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loose</humor-tell> (legs and arms), and so on.</p>

<p>The one on the right feels the least humor relative to the others—he's not smiling, not touching self, has hunched (not expansive) posture, not brightening, has low energy, and so on.</p>

<p>These are all the same humor tells we use throughout this book. At the same time, these humor tells are also distinctive to a particular time and place. Part of this is a structural determination.</p>

<p>For instance, the backless bench doesn't allow them to slouch backward, so they <em>can't</em> be leaning back the way they might in a sofa or an armchair. And since it's a bench, they can sit close enough to link arms—which people are more likely to do if benches like this are common.</p>

<p>Similarly, their jackets discourage people from raising their arms—the jacket crumples and lifts. Just like for groups that wear dress frames, epaulets, puffy sleeves, or so on—clothing can make it harder to put our arms around someone's shoulders, making it a less common humor tell for them.</p>

<p>By contrast, if we're just wearing t-shirts, it'll be easy to put our arms around someone's shoulder or waist—something we often see among some sports teams or at casual barbacues today. 

<p>That means how we <humor-tell>touch others</humor-tell> depends on common furniture, what we and others frequently wear, and so on. If we grew up with backless benches and people wearing jackets, a certain way of  <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell> will become normal.</p> 

<p>So the same humor tells (<humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>) takes on distinctive characteristics place-by-place, person-by-person, time-by-time—sometimes arbitrarily, but other times influenced by clothing, decorum, manufacturing capabilities, resources, weather, and so on.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Regional variations to humor</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">



<p>If people in our region frequently make biting jokes to each other, we’ll grow up expecting these comments. We’ll also learn that there’s no consequences to them, especially since we’ve grown up knowing how to handle them. In this case, biting jokes are medium mistakes that match medium OKs—and we’ll feel humor.</p> 

<p>But if our friend <em>visits</em> our region for the first time, a biting comment will seem unexpected—and be seen as having potentially negative personal consequences, especially if they don't know how to handle them. In this case, the biting comment will give our friend large mistakes with small OKs—and they wouldn't feel humor.</p>

<p>Since humor is part of how we group and feel good around each other, we can sometimes experience a kind of chronic humor fatigue when we relocate or travel—like if we find a region’s humor too soft or too hard—or if everyone does or doesn't smile in a way we’re not used to or we have trouble connecting with.</p>

<p>But even though these “senses of humor” are different group-by-group, family-by-family, time-by-time, it’s still the same system of mistakes and OKs, and still expressed through humor tells.
