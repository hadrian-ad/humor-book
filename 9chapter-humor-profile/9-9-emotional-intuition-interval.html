Emotional intuition
</h1>


Whenever we combine information together, we have a cognitive rush we call a feeling. For instance, we can't at first combine information to read sheet music, financial statements, scientific instruments, debugging reports, game user interface, forest health, and so on. But once we can take everything in at a glance, the cognitive rush of quickly combining everything together makes up the “feeling” of that activity. 

We eventually have a “feeling” when looking over financial statements. But we don’t have this feeling when we start out. That’s because the “feeling” is the feeling of quickly synthesizing bits of information. This means the feeling won't come before we're able to actually do it.

The same thing happens with emotions. We’ll always be expressing various combinations of emotion tells, but that doesn’t mean we'll make sense of them in any particular way.

This is why our emotions aren’t always obvious, especially the first time we come across them. Our first experiences with affection, arousal, grief, love, jealousy, shame, and so on are often confusing to us. We often don’t recognize what was going on until later. It takes awareness and practice for something like "jealousy" to cohere as a feeling.

That's because it's not until we interpret many emotion tells at a glance that we'll have the "feeling" of being jealous—since this feeling is actually the feeling of quickly interpreting and synthesizing emotion tells together. 

We were still expressing emotion tells for our early experiences with affection, arousal, grief, love, jealousy, shame, and so on—we just didn’t put them together in a way that had an overarching feeling. 

This is often a new way of thinking about emotions. We often learn simplistic models of emotions early in life, and are never presented with alternative models. But there are good reasons to have a variety of emotional models at our disposal.

For instance, in this model, we're expressing more low-intensity humor tells than we're currently interpreting (“feeling”) as humor. That means there's low-hanging fruit to feeling more humor in our lives—simply noticing our low-intensity humor tells as humor! 

If we practice registering these low-intensity humor tells—blips of focus, twinges in our cheeks, exhales, and so on—and consciously composite these humor tells together as humor, we’ll start “feeling humor” where we didn’t before. We're becoming aware of the humor we already experience.

This is especially useful during times that don't otherwise feel that interesting or exciting—and, as we'll talk about later, are sparks of humor we can cultivate into more humor. It's also an observational skill, of having better understanding of the evaluatory responses people make to the world around them.
