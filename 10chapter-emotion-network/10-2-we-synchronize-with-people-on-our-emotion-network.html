<p>This is what Zoe did on the train. The unexpected bounce activated similar topics for all the passengers.</p>
    
    <p>Since Zoe didn't <term>herself</term> know how to evaluate these topics, she instead paid attention to the evaluations made by the <em>other</em> passengers&mdash;and synchronized her mistakes and OKs to theirs.</p>

    <p><headline>Solitariness.</headline> Sometimes we don't know what to make of the fact that we're so blank-faced in private&mdash;like how we smile broadly as we say goodbye to a friend, only for our face to immediately become blank when we close the door. What's going on here?</p>
     
    <p>When we think of emotion tells as how we communicate on our emotion network <callback>(we smile broadly at our friend so they can see our evalutions)</callback>&mdash;it makes sense that the intensity of our emotion tells changes depending on our requirements for communication.</p>
     
  <p>If we see a friend across the room, we speak loudly&mdash;when we're close we speak softer. When the party is going we turn the music up, and when everyone leaves we turn it down.</p>
    
    <p>When we feel alone&mdash;like we're in our locked apartment&mdash;we're still radiating information about our evaluations. But the person we're communicating to is ourselves.</p>
     
   <p>We still have to communicate our evaluations to ourselves&mdash;but we can express these in softer ways that don't require the same kind of amplification as they do around others:</p>
   
       <img src=../images/10c-images-emotion-network/10-2-we-synchronize-with-people-on-our-emotion-network/10-2-2-box-loud-soft.png

    alt="This image has two circles with arrows radiating out. The one of the left has big arrows, the one on the right has small arrows. Annotations say 'when we feel public, our emotion tells are 'loud,' and when we feel private, our emotion tells are 'soft.'";
    title="Strength of signal";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

    
   <p> This is why our emotion tells get "louder" when we're alone but <sem>also</sem> simulating a social environment. When we stream a live show, talk to ourselves, talk to a pet, and so on, we'll often express more varied and intense humor tells than we would otherwise.</p>
