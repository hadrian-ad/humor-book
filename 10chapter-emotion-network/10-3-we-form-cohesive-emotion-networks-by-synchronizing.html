  <p>In the picture below, we have an immediate impression of everyone's emotional state&mdash;we know they're not about to break into a fight; start crying; take a nap; mill about with worry worried, or focused; or so on.
                    </p>

<p>We know these things because everyone is always radiating emotion tells, which forms an emotion network.</p>
     
    </div>

    
-->
    <p>We always network emotionally with everyone around us. When we walk into a coffee shop, we’ll be part of the overall emotion network:</p>

     <img src=../images/10c-images-emotion-network/10-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks/10-3-0-overall-network.png

    alt="A dashed line circles several circles radiating arrows. Each circle is labeled with a character, like Zoe, Emma, barista, pedestrian, and couple. An annotation says this is the overall emotion network.";
    title="Overall emotion network";
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>The overall network has the most shared topics its synchronizing around, like ‘public manners,’ ‘physical safety,’ ‘noise decorum,’ and so on.</p> 


<p>Within the overall network are <vocab>subnetworks</vocab>. These are emotion networks set within larger emotion networks&mdash;they synchronize around different topics than are shared by everyone:</p>

     <img src=../images/10c-images-emotion-network/10-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks/10-3-1-emotion-network-subnetworks.png

    alt="This figure expands on the previous by grouping a few people together. Zoe and Emma, and a couple are in circles labeled subnetwork.";
    title="Subnetworks";
    style="max-width: 28rem; margin-left: " 
     >

     

<p>For instance, Zoe and Emma are constantly synchronizing around many topics specific to them&mdash;which constitutes their emotion network within the emotion network.</p> 
 
<p>They’ll notice small desynchronizations on topics only they are closely monitoring:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>"Thank god Justin gave us all extensions."</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech> <action>*tilts head back slightly*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe doesn’t feel their evaluations are synchronized)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(curious)</internalaction> <speech>“Yeah? But what?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma picks up their desynchronization, and wants to resynchronize)</notes></p>
   </blockquote>
  
    </div>
 

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
       <p><narration>Zoe and Emma are on their laptops, when Zoe gives a small laugh.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*looks up*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“What?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma picks up their desynchronization, and wants to synchronize)</notes></p>
   </blockquote>
    
    </div>

<p>While head tilts or small laughs will desynchronize <term>Emma and Zoe’s</term> emotion network, it doesn't desynchronize the <term2>overall</term2> emotion network. No one outside the subnetwork cares that much, since Zoe’s head tilt doesn't involve any of the network-wide topics.</p>

<p>By contrast, if someone starts yelling, the overall network may feel desynchronized: 
    </p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote><p><narration>Someone start yelling and the entire cafe goes quiet.</narration> <notes>(&larr;yelling desynchronizes the overall network)</notes></p>
       
       <p><narration>Zoe and Emma start looking around. Zoe makes eye contact with someone sitting near the window, and Emma examines a couple who’s looking at the person yelling. The barista scans everyone in the room.</narration> <notes>(&larr;cafe tries to synchronize evaluations and reach an evaluatory consensus)</notes></p> </blockquote>
    </div>
    

<p>When the cafe becomes desynchronized, everyone there will try to resynchronize their evaluations. This establishes an emotional consensus, which helps them decide on what to do&mdash;like whether to intervene with the yeller or not. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="consider"><aside class="consider"><!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
            
            <p class="considertext
             ">If the cafe can’t resynchronize, there's no emotional consensus. The emotion network fragments, and people will feel uncomfortable or unsafe and leave:</p>
            
             <img src=../images/10c-images-emotion-network/10-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks/10-3-2-fragmenting.png
            
            alt="This image has circles grouped together with emotion network lines. One group is labeled as unconcerned, the other as concerned. The label on the bottom says 'emotion network fragmented.'";
            title="";
            style="max-width: 14rem ; margin-left: 2rem;"

<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Efficiency.</headline> Our emotion network lets us to have greater evaluatory awareness than we would on our own. That's because emotion networks give efficiencies of scale. In the same way many <term>hands</term> make light <term>manual</term> work, many <term2>evaluators</term2> make light <term2>evaluatory</term2> work.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, when a dish breaks in the kitchen of a cafe, all twenty customers don't need to walk to the kitchen to personally decide whether or not everything's okay. Instead, one or two people can make a evaluation on it, and then everyone else can join that conclusion.</p> 
    
    <p>So if a dish breaks and the staff are calm, the customers will be calm&mdash;even without actually knowing what specifically happened. By pooling our evaluations, the cafe limits the number of redundant evaluations that had to happen for everyone to feel aware and calm.</p>
