<p>We use emotions to communicate with each other. Our <a href="../8chapter-humor-tell/8-0-humor-tells.html">emotion tells</a> project information about our emotional state:</p>

    alt="A circle has arrows radiating out from it, with an annotation that says 'our emotion tells project information around us.";
    title="Projecting emotion tells";
    style="max-width: 14rem; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>We're communicating this information every moment of our lives:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   
   <p><narration>Emma is sniffling on the bus from sadness, her eyes red. The people around her are aware that she’s sad.</narration> <notes>(&larr;emotion tells as a communication system)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- LATER -</p>
    
    <p><narration>Zoe asks Emma if she wants to go to a movie, and Emma says sure. At hearing her tone of voice, Zoe pauses and evaluates Emma’s downcast posture and red eyes.</narration> <speech>“You sure?”</speech> <narration>she asks, concerned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;emotion tells as a communication system)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- LATER -</p>
    
    <p><narration>While waiting for the <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title> screening to start, Emma perks up, which makes Zoe feel happy.</narration> <notes>(&larr;emotion tells as a communication system)</notes></p>
    
    </div>

<p>Everyone around Emma could take information from her emotion tells—even people who didn’t know her:</p>

    alt="This image shows a circle radiating arrows. Two circles are connected to the other circle with a dotted line, with an annotation on them that says 'people around Emma can read her emotion tells.";
    title="We can read emotion tells";
    style="max-width: 24rem; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>This information goes both ways—<term>people</term> could read <em>Emma’s</em> emotion tells, just like <term>Emma</term> could read <em>theirs</em>. Whenever we're around others, we can’t help but share and receive information. </p>

<p>This system is our <vocab>emotion network</vocab>. We join these networks automatically, whenever we're around others:</p>

    alt="Several circles are radiating arrows, and each are connected with a dotted line. An annotation says 'our emotion tells project information around us.";
    title="Emotion network";
    style="max-width: 22rem ; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>Our emotion network is why being at a cafe doesn’t feel the same as drinking coffee alone at home—since being around others feels intensely different than just being by ourselves:</p>

    alt="A comparison image shows a solitary circle with arrows radiating out, and many circles with arrows radiating out, connecting with a dotted line. Annotations say 'drinking coffee alone is different compared to being in a coffee shop.";

<p>For most of us, the fact that we’re aware of what other people are feeling is so obvious, it’s almost hard to think about—it’s invisibly normal, like breathing. But by focusing on this, we’ll be able to make sense of what humor is doing in our lives, and why. </p>

<p>We'll be going over this in the rest of this chapter.</p>     

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Emotional communication.</headline> If we're at a movie theater, we can pick up on the emotion tells of the audience around us—even in the dark, around people we don’t know, facing away from them, in a noisy environment, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>We do this through the tone of their whispering, style of shifting, rustling of candy packets, tone and duration of laughter, exclamations, rate of bathroom-leaving, and so on. Everyone is constantly radiating information about their emotional state, which we pick up in all kinds of ways.</p>

    <p>Even though the man is privately involved with his camel, his emotions are projected around him. This lets us interpret his emotional state, even though he's not intending to communicate to anyone in particular.</p>

     <p>People on emotion networks react dynamically to everyone else. One person reacts, others react to that reaction, others react to the reaction of the reaction, and so on. This informational tension keeps people aware of changing emotional states.</p>

    <p>Sitting in the cafe above by ourselves would be very different than sitting drinking alone at home. It would inescapably feel social, even if we don't talk or really even pay attention to anyone—because we've joined a larger emotion network by going to a cafe.</p>
