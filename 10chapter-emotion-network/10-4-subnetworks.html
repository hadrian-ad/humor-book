    <h2 id="10-04">Overall networks have subnetworks</h2>
  

<p>Since everyone is always radiating emotion tells, we can always make inferences about a room's evaluatory state.</p>
    
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">If we walk into a room, we can immediately tell if the people there are belligerent, bored, cowering, delighted, focused, posturing, relaxed, scared, studious, worried, and so on&mdash;and in what combination.</p> </div>
       
<p>We can do this even if we don't know the context of those feelings, and even if they're not aware of us! 
        </p>

<p>If we looked into the room above, we'd be able to draw information from the emotion network.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">It's obvious how much information we're drawing by thinking about what we know <sem>isn't</sem> about to happen.</p>        
        
        <p class="considertext">In the picture above, we know there isn't going to be a fight, a nap, a dance party, screams, shared grief, and so on. By realizing how much we can <term>exclude</term>, we realize how much we <em>know</em>.</p> 
                 </div>
     
         <p>Within an overall network are subnetworks. At the dance hall below, we can see how fifty people aren't splitting their attention evenly among themselves&mdash;instead, people give different amounts of attention to different people, leading to subnetworks:</p>

    alt="This older photograph shows a ballroom. People are talking around tables, or dancing in the middle of the floor. Lines are drawn over different groupings to illustrate subnetworks, like the couples dancing, who themselves are in a larger circle of people on the dancefloor. Each table has their own circle.";

<p>Similarly, at a cafe everyone is vaguely aware of everyone else <callback>(overall network)</callback>&mdash;but different groups are more intensely aware of subsections <callback>(subnetwork)</callback>.</p>
