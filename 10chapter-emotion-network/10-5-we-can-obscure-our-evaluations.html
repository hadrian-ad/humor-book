<h3 id="10-05">We can obscure our evaluations</h3>
    
<p>We use emotion networks to share information about our evaluations. Sometimes, we are <term>transparent</term> about our evaluations&mdash;but other times, we <term2>obscure</term2> our evaluations:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>  <p><narration>Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table, and they look up at him.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>*stares blank faced*</internalaction> <notes>(&larr;Emma is guarding her evaluations)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(carefully)</internalaction> <speech>"Nice hat."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe is guarding her evaluations)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(uncomfortable)</internalaction> <speech>"Thanks."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen is uncomfortable he can’t read their true evaluations)</notes></p> </blockquote>  
    </div>
    
<p>We obscure our evaluations for a variety of reasons, but this isn’t particular to <term>humor</term>&mdash;since we also obscure <term><emotions>anger</emotions></term> or <term><emotions>boredom</emotions></term>.</p>

<p>More specifically, we’re not trying to obscure an <term2>emotion</term2>, like <emotions>humor</emotions> or <emotions>anger</emotions>&mdash;we're trying to obscure an <term2>evaluation</term2>, which is the size of our mistake or OK:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
     <p><narration>Trevor feels ridiculous in his tiny suit. Yasmin’s extended family is chatting around him. His stomach is twisted from nervousness and he tries as hard as possible to look at ease.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor has a small OK, but tries to act as if he has a large OK)</notes></p>
 </blockquote>

<div class="vignette">
 <blockquote>
           <p><narration>Jennifer and Amber are having coffee while Riley is playing with toy cars on the floor. Out of the blue, Riley says a slur and asks Jennifer what it means. Amber coughs and takes a drink.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Amber is amused, but tries to disguise her emotion tells)</notes></p>
        
        <p><narration>Jennifer’s a bit shocked and embarrassed</narration> <speech>“Where did you hear that word, sweetie?”</speech> <narration>she asks, calmly.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer sees this as a large mistake, but tries to act as if it were a small mistake)</notes>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote><p>
        <narration>Alina is uninterested in the story Hana is telling, and can’t understand why Hana thinks the subject is a big deal. But to be polite, Alina pretends to be shocked. Hana finishes her story about her burnt pizza.</narration></p> 
        <p>
        <speaker>Alina:</speaker> <internalaction>(pretending to care)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh my gosh,”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Alina sees this story as built around a small mistake, but tries to act as if she saw it as a big mistake)</notes>

<p>Often, the better we know someone's <a href="../9chapter-humor-profile/9-0-humor-profile.html">emotion profile</a>, the better we can draw accurate information from obscured or pretended evaluations.</p> 

<p>This is one reason it's often easier to generate humor with our friends than it is with strangers. Not only are our friends generally transparent with their evaluations around us&mdash;we can also better see past pretended evaluations.</p>

            <p>Sometimes we think being "open" means sharing intimate or vulnerable thoughts and memories. But usually, it more means being transparent with our evaluations.</p> 
            
         
        
            <p>When we see people who connect quickly with classmates, coworkers, strangers, and so on, it's not because they immediately talk about deep things&mdash;instead, they are skilled at bringing about mutually transparent evaluations, which lets them experience mutual humor&mdash;mutual <emotions>connection</emotions>&mdash;easily.</p>

<aside class="box"><p><b>Physical.</b> Emotion networks are sensual systems&mdash;they're "in the senses." Emotion networks can be felt or described as colorful, expressive, in motion, intense, noisy, physical, quiet, subtle, warm, and so on. They’re also:</p> 
     
     <ul>
        <li><strong>Spatial.</strong> Someone’s emotion tells takes up space&mdash;like how whispering under a blanket or shouting in an empty ballroom has a spatial dimension to it. When we close a door to shut out another conversation, we’re spatially changing how our emotion network works. </li>
         
     <li><strong>Unique.</strong> An emotion network is composed of unique evaluators, as well as taking place in a unique circumstances in a distinct space. This is why the feeling of an emotion network changes when someone leaves or enters a room, or even when a chair is removed&mdash;the composition changes. Each emotion network is never the same twice.
                 </li>    
         
         <li><strong>Aesthetic.</strong> Emotion networks can be captivating, and permeate everything around us. They can include the way voices sound and interact with spatial acoustics; the way people sit or dress; the way chairs or clothes feel; the smell of the place we’ve chosen to gather; and so on&mdash;all of which can contribute to how we express and understand emotion tells.</li>
         </ul> 
     
     <p>These combine into how we think about emotion networks&mdash;as tangible things we can alter and shape, experience and have opinions on.
