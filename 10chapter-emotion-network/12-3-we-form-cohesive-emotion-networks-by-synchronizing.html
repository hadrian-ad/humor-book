  <p>In the picture below, we have an immediate impression of everyone's emotional state—we know they're not about to break into a fight; start crying; take a nap; mill about with worry worried, or focused; or so on.
                    </p>

<p>We know these things because everyone is always radiating emotion tells, which forms an emotion network.</p>
     
    </div>

    
-->
    <p>We always network emotionally with everyone around us. When we walk into a coffee shop, we’ll be part of the overall emotion network:</p>

     <img src=../images/12c-images-emotion-network/12-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks/12-3-0-overall-network.png

    alt="A dashed line circles several circles radiating arrows. Each circle is labeled with a character, like Zoe, Emma, barista, pedestrian, and couple. An annotation says this is the overall emotion network.";
    title="Overall emotion network";
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>The overall network has the most shared topics its synchronizing around, like ‘public manners,’ ‘physical safety,’ ‘noise decorum,’ and so on.</p> 


<p>Within the overall network are <vocab>subnetworks</vocab>. These are emotion networks set within larger emotion networks&mdash;they synchronize around different topics than are shared by everyone:</p>

     <img src=../images/12c-images-emotion-network/12-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks/12-3-1-emotion-network-subnetworks.png

    alt="This figure expands on the previous by circling a few cicles radiating arrows together. Zoe and Emma, and a couple are in circles labeled subnetwork.";
    title="Subnetworks";
    style="max-width: 28rem; margin-left: " 
     >

     

<p>For instance, Zoe and Emma are constantly synchronizing around many topics specific to them&mdash;which constitutes their emotion network within the emotion network.</p> 
 
<p>They’ll notice small desynchronizations on topics only they are closeLy monitoring:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>"Thank god Justin gave us all extensions."</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech> <action>*tilts head back slightly*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe doesn’t feel their evaluations are synchronized)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(curious)</internalaction> <speech>“Yeah? But what?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma picks up their desynchronization, and wants to resynchronize)</notes></p>
  
    </div>
 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe and Emma are on their laptops, when Zoe gives a small laugh.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*looks up*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“What?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma picks up their desynchronization, and wants to synchronize)</notes></p>
    
    </div>

<p>While head tilts or small laughs will desynchronize <term>Emma and Zoe’s</term> emotion network, it doesn't desynchronize the <em>overall</em> emotion network&mdash;since Zoe’s head tilt didn’t involve any of the network-wide topics.</p>

<p>By contrast, if someone starts yelling, the overall network may feel desynchronized: 
    </p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Someone start yelling and the entire cafe goes quiet.</narration> <notes>(&larr;yelling desynchronizes the overall network)</notes></p>
   
   <p><narration>Zoe and Emma start looking around. Zoe makes eye contact with someone sitting near the window, and Emma examines a couple who’s looking at the person yelling. The barista scans everyone in the room.</narration> <notes>(&larr;cafe tries to synchronize evaluations and reach an evaluatory consensus)</notes></p> 
    </div>
    

<p>When the cafe becomes desynchronized, everyone there will try to resynchronize their evaluations. This establishes an emotional consensus, which helps them decide on what to do&mdash;like whether to intervene with the yeller or not. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext
         ">If the cafe can’t resynchronize, there's no emotional consensus. The emotion network fragments, and people will feel uncomfortable or unsafe and leave:</p>
        
         <img src=../images/12c-images-emotion-network/12-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks/12-3-2-fragmenting.png
        
        alt="This image has circles grouped together with emotion network lines. One groupp is labeled as unconcerned, the other as concerned. The label on the bottom says 'emotion network fragmented.'";
        title="";
        style="max-width: 14rem ; margin-left: 2rem;" 
         >
        </div>
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Efficiency.</headline> Our emotion network lets us to have greater evaluatory awareness than we would on our own. That's because emotion networks give us an efficiency of scale. In the same way many <term>hands</term> make light <term>manual</term> work, many <em>evaluators</em> make light <em>evaluatory</em> work.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, when a dish breaks in the kitchen of a cafe, all twenty customers don't need to walk to the kitchen to personally decide whether or not everything's okay. Instead, one or two people can make a evaluation on it, and then everyone else can join that conclusion.</p> 
    
    <p>So if a dish breaks and the staff are calm, the customers will be calm—even without actually knowing what specifically happened. By pooling our evaluations, the cafe limits the number of redundant evaluations that had to happen.</p>
