<h2 id="exclude-navigation">We can demystify random humor by explaining evaluations</h2>

<p>We're used to analyzing something to understand it. <callback>("I smiled because sunsets are a metaphor for the beauty of conclusions”)</callback> But this is often less useful than it can seem for humor.</p>

<p>This is obvious with random humor attempts. There's nothing about yelling <callback>"PINEAPPLE"</callback> that's waiting to be thematically analyzed and deciphered before we can understand why Riley felt humor.</p>

<consider>For instance:</consider>

<p>We wouldn't try to understand Riley's laughter by combing through the pineapple's literary associations, historical context, and inherent symbolism. <callback>(“Riley smiled because pineapples are universal symbols of the womb and generative properties.”)</callback></p>

<p>Instead, there's something more immediate to think about, tethered to Riley’s evaluations of the content and situation. What does Riley feel she’s expected to say here, and what does she say instead? What does she expect of fruit, and how might pineapple deviate from those expectations?</p>

<p>But the same thing happens with any humor—even when things seem more complicated or less random. When Jennifer smiles at a sunset, the explanation isn't waiting to be unlocked or deciphered through careful study of sunsets.</p>

<p>If Jennifer spends the time, she could come up with dozens of metaphors that make her smile. But these new smiles are about those new metaphors—the new metaphors aren't going back in time to explain the old smile she had at the sunrise.</p>

<consider>Consider:</consider>

<p>In this sense, thinking of new metaphors are a kind of a humor attempt—Jennifer's looking for something that makes her feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, and so on. </p>

<p>If Jennifer wanted to explain her initial humor, she'd have to characterize her mistakes and OKs. If she says: <callback>"I guess seeing it out of the window caught me off guard,"</callback> Jennifer is trying to convey her relation to the content and situation—without backfilling that previous moments with new things.</p> 

<p>Sometimes we fixate on describing content in greater and greater variety. But that's no guarantee we'll get closer to clearly describing our experiences with humor. </p>

<p>Random humor helps us see past this fixation. It's obvious that we don't need to dig too deeply to understand things like <callback>“ouloulouloul”</callback>—instead of understanding content, it's more important to understand the emotional situation.</p> 

But this is true for <sem-weak>all</sem-weak> moments of humor. By understanding random humor, we have the base solution to characterize, predict, explain, and understand any humor—since all humor happens or not through the same process.



 

<p><b>Points.</b> Humor doesn’t have a “point.” Sometimes humor <sem-weak>attempts</sem-weak> seem to have a point—but we shouldn’t confuse this point with the emotion of humor.</p>

<p>For instance, we previously saw a 20th century satire in favor of women’s suffrage. <callback>(“Are women people?”)</callback>. This content was arranged to make an argument or point. But this point is distinct from the humor.</p>

<p>We know this because we could see this point, but not feel humor—just like we could feel humor, but not from this point. That’s because humor and points are independent from each other.</p>

<p>The people who make humor attempts hope that humor and their intended points will overlap. But even when they do, the "point" and humor are still formally unrelated things.</p> 

<p>This is why it’s not odd that we can feel humor from a random word <callback>("pineapple")</callback> or a random comic even when there is no “point.” Similarly, it's also why it’s not odd if we <sem-weak>don’t</sem-weak> feel humor from a point, even if it’s thoughtfully put together. Any point and any humor are independent things that sometimes overlap.</p>
