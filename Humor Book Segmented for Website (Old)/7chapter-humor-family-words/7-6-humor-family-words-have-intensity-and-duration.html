	Emma had been uncomfortable for so long that her discomfort had become a <em>durable</em> expectation&mdash;it was part of how she expected the world to be. This led to a long mistake, which contributes to her long

            In all these examples, we can use whichever humor family words seem accurate. When Lina gets accepted, we don't have to <term>only</term> describe her humor as <emotions>achievement</emotions>&mdash;we could <term2>also</term2> describe her humor as <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>,
