<p>In this chapter, weâ€™ll look at <vocab>spectator entertainment</vocab>&mdash;things were the emotional priority is on spectators: </p>

    </div>

<p>When Xiaowei does a funny waddle, what he cares most about isn't how <term>he</term> feels&mdash;it matters most how the people <em>spectating</em> feel.</p>

<p>Since his <sem>priority</sem> is on the experience of the spectators, waddling <callback>(or mod or play)</callback> is spectator entertainment.</p> 
   
   <p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.

     <p><headline>Priorities.</headline>      
    
         We can think about the difference between an <term>interpersonal</term> orientation or a <em>spectator</em> orientation by thinking about the difference between competitive wrestling and dramatized wrestling:</p> 
          
          <ul>
             <li><strong>Competitive wrestling</strong> is intense and interesting to <term>participants</term>&mdash;but not always as interesting to <em>spectators</em>. Casual spectators might see the wrestlers in odd-looking helmets and uniforms locked in a static grapple for a long time before something happens quickly and the match is over.</li> 
              
              <li><strong>Dramatized wrestling</strong> is designed to be intense and interesting to the <term>audience</term>&mdash;and how the <em>participants</em> feel is less important. In order to better commercialize wrestling, showrunners staged and performed scenes in a way that was easy to follow, exciting, visually stimulating, and so on&mdash;for the <sem-weak>audience</sem-weak>.</li>
              </ul>

<p>Even though they both might be called "wrestling," the priorities make them different.</p>
