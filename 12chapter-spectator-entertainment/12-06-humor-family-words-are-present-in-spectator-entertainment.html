<p>Above, Trevor and Duke are <term>synchronized</term>&mdash;they're both feeling <emotions>achievement</emotions> at the same time.</p> 
   
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
          <p class="considertext">This makes it easy for us to think of Trevor's humor as humor family words, since we cue off the content of the movie.</p> </div>
    
<p>But even when our emotional reactions are <em>desynchronized</em> with characters, we can still describe our humor with humor family words:</p>
      
      
      <div class="vignette">

style="max-width: 21rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: "

<p>Since Lina and Xiaowei don't match emotions with Rosie, we might first be tempted to describe their humor as a feeling of <emotions>danger</emotions> <callback>(like Rosie is feeling)</callback>&mdash;but Lina and Xiaowei are actually feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>!</p>
      
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
          <p class="considertext">It's not surprising that  Lina and Xiaowei might feel <emotions>safety</emotions> watching someone <term>pretend</term> to be chased by a <term>fake</term> alien parasite&mdash;even at the same time they'd feel <emotions>danger</emotions> if they were watching someone <em>actually</em> be chased by a <em>real</em> alien parasite.</p>

 <p>We can see this same outcomes of screens and spectator orientations elsewhere:</p>
       
             
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma and Owen are watching <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title>. Guys on horses fight guys on motorcycles; guys with swords fight women with scythes; one old guy uses an abacus as his main weapon, and constantly adds up the number of guys he’s killed on it.

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is reading <book-title>Peace is a Gentle Mountain</book-title>, and the writing is so calm and relaxing.

Zoe smiles lightly as she reads.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels <emotions>comfort</emotions>&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
<p>Sometimes we read about hard work and wonder why it feels good&mdash;but Zoe isn't actually doing hard work. She's instead feeling <emotions>comfort</emotions> from the book. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback>

      <img class="img-indent"
       
       src="../images/12c-images-spectator-entertainment/12-6-humor-family-words-are-present/12-6-2-hard-work.sketchpad.png"
        title="Novel involving hard work"
alt="This interaction template shows the character and work horse on one side of the screen, and Zoe reading on the other. An annotation says it's not surprising that the emotional reactions on either end of the screen don't match."
style="max-width: 23rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: "

<p>When we think about it, it's not surprising that <term>reading</term> about an experience has a different emotional outcome than actually <em>experiencing</em> it. They're completely different!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We don't read about a feast and then wonder why we're still hungry. Even so, we sometimes read about something terrible and then wonder why we laugh!</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">In the same way <book-title>reading</book-title> about a feast isn't feasting, reading about something terrible isn't suffering through it. </p>
    
    <!--
    
    <p class="considertext">Even so, we sometimes see people ask things like <callback>"why does this terrible thing make me laugh?"</callback>&mdash;even when the more accurate question is <callback>"why does <sem>reading</sem> about this terrible thing make me laugh?"</callback>
    </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We can make that question answerable by first droppping the "terrible," and then replacing "laugh" with a humor family words: <callback>"Why does <outcome-contrast>reading</outcome-contrast> about this thing make me feel <emotions>safety</emotions> (<emotions>comfort, connection, relief,</emotions> or so on)?"</callback></p> 
    
    -->
</div>

<!--
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When Trevor laughs after being scared while taking out the dog, and Lina and Xiaowei laugh after being scared while watching a horror movie&mdash;the shared experience was <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This lets us avoid fixating on content. Instead of asking infinite <term>content</term> questions <callback>"why do we laugh at alien parasites?"</callback>, <callback>"why do we laugh after being spooked"</callback>, and so on&mdash;we can ask a <outcome-contrast>few</outcome-contrast> <em>emotional</em> question instead. <callback>("Why do we laugh at safety?")</callback></p> 
    </div>

<p>It's also not surprising that the surface content is sometimes unimportant. When Zoe <term>reads</term> a book that has hard work in it, she's not <em>doing</em> hard work. So the question isn't <callback>"why is hard work funny?"</callback>&mdash;it's actually <callback>"why is <strong>reading</strong> about hard work funny?"</callback></p> 

  
<p>Zoe isn't evaluating the abstract idea of "hard work." Instead, she's having a personal relation to the book's contrasts, contexts, presentation, and so on. It's these things that shift  Zoe's mistakes and OK into balance. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback></p>

    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Wink and a nod.</headline> We're sometimes surprised that so many movies advertised as "scary" aren't really scary&mdash;but we're only surprised if we're taking their advertising at face value.</p> 
  
<p>So even though <book-title>Squeal IV</book-title> promotes itself as scary, its appeal to teenagers isn't actually <term>scariness</term>&mdash;it’s appeal is that it generates <em>humor</em>. Any scariness is just a means to an ends: of feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
   
<p>We know this for all kinds of reasons. If scariness alone was appealing, then children scared to their core by adult movies would enjoy the experience&mdash;but they don’t. Similarly, if goriness alone was appealing, then adults would love watching gory war footage&mdash;but they don't. 

<p>That’s because neither scariness nor gore is the appeal of scary movies&mdash;the appeal is humor. This is why so many horror movies are campy and cliche. When humor <outcome-contrast>isn't</outcome-contrast> present, scariness and gore isn't appealing.</p>

<p>If someone <sem>doesn't</sem> feel humor from jump scares, they'd rather do almost anything than watch movies built around them. Of course, even if they'd never watch them alone, they may watch them with friends if they think the film will allow them to together have emotional experiences of <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

     <div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    

<p class="considertext">Spectator entertainment with <term>permeable</term> screens <callback>(like in-person performances)</callback> often gives us the feeling of <term>including</term> us, which makes them feel vivid and interesting. Things with permeable screens feel dynamic, and allow for  reactive participation.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">By contrast, spectator entertainment with <em>impermeable</em> screens <callback>(like remotely viewed performances)</callback> often has the feeling of <em>excluding</em> us, which makes them feel lifeless or grating outside of specific circumstances.</p> 
   
    </div>
   

     <p>We can see all kinds of evaluatory screens:</p>
      
    <ul class="close-list">
         <li>A play has a <sem>pretend</sem> screen, where the actors receive evaluatory information but, by-and-large,  carry on as if they didn't receive any</li>
          
          <li>A movie or memory has as <sem>absolute</sem> screen, where the characters will never receive evaluatory information</li>
          
          <li>A car window, distance, or overflow monitor is a <sem>removable</sem> screen, where we could take an action to create a two-way flow of evaluatory information</li> 
          
          <li>An athletic game has a <sem>concentration</sem> screen, where participants need so much focus that they can't focus on the audience</li>
          
         
          </ul>
      
      <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
          


   
<p>An evaluatory screen doesn't mean something is spectator entertainment. Something is only spectator entertainment when the <sem>priority</sem> is on one group&mdash;and there may or may not be a screen.</p> 
             
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">If a salesman flatters us, there <term>isn't</term> a screen&mdash;but since the priority is <sem>us</sem>, it <term>is</term> spectator entertainment. Similarly, if we watch street life from our window, there <em>is</em> an evaluatory screen&mdash;but since the priority <outcome-contrast>isn't</outcome-contrast> <sem>us</sem>, it <em>isn't</em> spectator entertainment.</p>
    </div>    

    <p>Screens help us think about desynchronized evaluations.</p> 
            
                         
    <p>Usually, desynchronized evaluations are destructive to emotion networks&mdash;groups break apart if some people laugh while others cry without any sort of movement toward evaluatory synchronization.</p> 
              
       
<p>But when there <sem-weak>is</sem-weak> a screen, these desynchronized evaluations aren't immediately destructive&mdash;like when we laugh at a movie, memory, or people who can't receive our evaluatory information. The screen allows this desynchronization to happen in a context that can feel free from the normal constraints of an emotion network.</p> 
    
         
    </div>
    
      
<!--
<p>This can help us think about why people may <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to go to small humor-generating environments, like a local comedy club, improv show, open mic night, regional film festival, underground theater, and so on&mdash;even if those things seem unappealing to us.</p> 

<p>People enjoy going to them for the same reason people like going to art films, indie bands, indie games, niche artists, small content creators, and so on&mdash;the less commercialized things are, the less they’re shaped by commercial design constraints.</p>

<p>The people who attend these things often experience them as authentic, cutting-edge, fresh, raw, relevant, resonant, vivid, or so on&mdash;it’s the same for a local artist or band as for a small-time humorist.</p> 


    <p class="for-instance-text">This is part of the appeal of user-generated content on forums as well, like memes, which allow for low-cost sharing of small-scale spectator entertainment.
    
      local humorist may make jokes about that specific restaurant&mdash;which provides something we won’t get from something more  commercialized.
    </p>
    

<p>Finally, the chance to <sem-weak>be</sem-weak> somewhere gives us a richer range of active topics and different bookending experiences of arriving and leaving.</p>
