Actors are an evaluatory group
</h2>


<p>We’ve made flowcharts that include the characters and the audience, but we've left one group out&mdash;the actors themselves!</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
   
   <blockquote>
       <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer are acting out a scene where Sam realizes he forget to buy the cream cheese with green onion, and tries to charm his way out of it.</narration></p> 
       
       <p><narration>Jennifer and Sam concentrate on acting, as their characters act stand-offish. As Sam gets up on the table, the audience laughs.</narration></p>

title="Flowchart with two starting conditions"
alt="This flowchart has two sizes of mistakes labeled 'no cream cheese.' If it's a large mistake, it can go to a smaller OK (we're the characetrs) or a balanced OK (we're in the audience). If it's a small mistake, it can go to a larger OK (we're the actors)."

<p>Above, we’ve added a third evaluation column: Sam and Jennifer&mdash; as the real people under their characters.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">Sam and Jennifer <sem-weak>themselves</sem-weak> don’t feel humor, since they’ve rehearsed their scene so much&mdash;everything is completely expected <callback>(small mistake)</callback> and they're so experienced and grounded that everything feels without risk of negative personal consequence <callback>(large OK)</callback>. </p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>In order for the actors to feel humor, either the mistake needs to grow or the OK needs to shrink. If their evaluations balance, they’ll feel humor and potentially break character:</p>

    <p class="considertext">We often love when actors break characters&mdash;which is why we like bloopers, improv skits, or live comedians. This interplay between the actors' evaluations and the evaluations the actors are <sem-weak>pretending</sem-weak> to have is something we find enjoyable.
