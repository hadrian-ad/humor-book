Actors are an evaluatory group
</h1>


<p>We’ve made flowcharts that include the characters and the audience, but we've left one group out&mdash;the actors themselves!</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
   
   <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer are acting out a scene where Sam realizes he forget to buy the cream cheese with green onion, and tries to charm his way out of it.</narration></p> 
   
   <p><narration>Jennifer and Sam concentrate on acting, as their characters act stand-offish. As Sam gets up on the table, the audience laughs.</narration></p>

title="Flowchart with two starting conditions"
alt="This flowchart has two sizes of mistakes for 'no cream cheese.' If it's a large mistake, it can go to a smaller OK (we're the characetrs) or a balanced OK (we're in the audience). If it's a small mistake, it can go to a larger OK (we're the actors)."

<p>Above, we’ve added a third evaluation column: Sam and Jennifer&mdash; as the real people under their characters.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Sam and Jennifer <sem-weak>themselves</sem-weak> don’t feel humor, since they’ve rehearsed their scene so much&mdash;everything is completely expected <callback>(small mistake)</callback> and they're so experienced and grounded that everything feels without consequence <callback>(large OK)</callback>. </p>
</div>

<p>In order for the actors to feel humor, either the mistake needs to grow or the OK needs to shrink. If their evaluations balance, they’ll feel humor and potentially break character:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    
   <p>
       <narration>This is Jennifer’s first performance&mdash;ever. She feels sick to her stomach.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer has small OK)</notes>
   </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>She and Sam are onstage. The curtain rises. Jennifer pauses. Sam looks at her meaningfully&mdash;she has the first line. She opens her mouth and pauses.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer has small mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>She giggles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;small mistake and small OK match&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;Jennifer breaks character)</notes>
    </p>
     </div>
<div class="vignette">
   <p>
       <narration>Jennifer’s been acting since third grade. She’s seen and dealt with it all.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer has a large OK)</notes>
   </p>
   
    <p>
        <narration>She and Sam are onstage. The curtain rises. Sam takes a step forward and stumbles over a prop. As he twists, his costume snags and gives a loud rip.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer has a large mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>He stands there, half-shirtless. The audience is shocked, but Sam rolls with it and leans suavely on the table, giving Jennifer a composed look. Jennifer gives a loud laugh before she recovers and continues the scene.</narration> <notes>(&larr;large mistake and large OK match&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;Jennifer breaks character)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>

<div class="consider">
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">We often love when actors break characters&mdash;which is why we like bloopers, improv skits, or live comedians. This interplay between the actors' evaluations and the evaluations the actors are <sem-weak>pretending</sem-weak> to have is something we find enjoyable.
