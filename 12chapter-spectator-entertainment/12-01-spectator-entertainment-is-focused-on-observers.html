<p>Sam and Jennifer felt humor <term>participating</term> in the interaction&mdash;but that doesn't mean anyone <term2>reading</term2> about their interaction would feel the same amount of humor.</p> 

<div class="consider">
  <aside class="consider">
        <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
        <p>If their interaction was caught on film and shown on a sitcom, the video might be charming&mdash;but audiences wouldn't laugh the way Sam and Jennifer do.</p>

<p>By contrast, if <term>Sam</term> and <term>Jennifer</term> were cast in a <em>play</em>, we <callback>(the audience)</callback> would feel more humor than <term2>they</term2> <callback>(the actors)</callback> would feel.</p>

<p>In the example above, it’s <em>only</em> the audience that felt humor. Sam and Jennifer weren't trying to shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor for <term>themselves</term>&mdash;they were trying to shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor for the <term2>spectators</term2>.</p>

        <p>When we laugh at something in a show, all we know is that that thing was good at making people watching shows laugh! It doesn't straightforwardly mean it would be good at making the people around us laugh.
