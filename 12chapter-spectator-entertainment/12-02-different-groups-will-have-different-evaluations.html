Evaluations are different for different groups
</h2>


<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to think about why the <term>characters</term> and <term2>spectators</term2> have different emotional outcomes:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Sam walks into the kitchen and puts hand on Jennifer’s shoulder. He sees her bagel without cream cheese.</narration></p>

<p>We can use the same method to think about why some surreal content makes us laugh, but similar non-surreal content doesn’t:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Sam watches <book-title>Fired Fireman 3</book-title> on his laptop. Chief is trying to get the household ready for school, but he’s comically inept at it. As he runs to get the doorbell, he slips on a toy car left on the stairs. Sam loves the slapstick in these things.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
        
        <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
        
        <p><narration>Sam watches Jennifer slip on a toy car left on the stairs. His heart wrenches in fear.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>While these diverging outcomes happen everywhere in our lives, in spectator entertainment the <em>priority</em> is on the spectator. This priority shapes how spectator entertainment is put together.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">Not all diverging outcomes are spectator entertainment&mdash;it's only spectator entertainment when the <sem-weak>priority</sem-weak> is on spectators.</p>
           
           <p class="considertext">Most plays are designed so that the audience will laugh, not the actors&mdash;the intention to prioritize others makes it spectator entertainment.</p>
