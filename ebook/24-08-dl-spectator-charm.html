<p>Emma and Zoe found this memorable in part because of the humor family words they felt having watched it together&mdash;they have positive memories of <emotions>connection (with each other)</emotions> with each other.</p> 

<p>But their relation to the comedy attempt itself is more ambiguous. The show itself is relatively unimportant compared to their experience with each other&mdash;and had they watched it by themselves they may not have found it memorable at all.</p>

           <deeper-look>A deeper look</deeper-look> 
            <deeper-title>Spectator Charm</deeper-title>
            </h4>   
         
    <p>Sometimes, the word “charm” makes us think about <vocab>spectator charm</vocab>&mdash;which makes us think of a certain kind of affectation, background, confidence, flirtatiousness, glamour, grooming, wit, and so on.</p>

<p>In our chapter on <a href="12-00-spectator-entertainment.html">spectator entertainment</a>, we saw how things like insults or getting hit by a bus can make <term>characters</term> feel bad, even as it makes <term>spectators</term> feel humor. Insults can generate humor in <term2>movies</term2>&mdash;but that doesn't straightforwardly mean they generate humor the same way in <term2>real life</term2>.</p>  
        
    <p>The same thing is true of charming spectator characters. As an audience, we may smile at characters with:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list">
       <li>ambiguous or impossible personal backgrounds</li>
        <li>dark, antiheroic aesthetics</li>
        <li>cold-blooded instincts</li> 
        <li>stainless (or stained) honor</li>
        <li>utter confidence</li>
        <li>perfect beauty </li>
        <li>wealth</li>
        
        </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p>
    
    <p>But in the same way we can smile at a character getting hit by a bus <em>without</em> that meaning the same thing would make us smile in real life&mdash;we can smile at a charming spectator character <callback>("utter confidence")</callback> <em>without</em> thinking that same thing would make us smile in real life.</p> 
       
    <p>This is why we shouldn't straightforwardly aspire to mimicking spectator entertainment in our day-to-day lives:</p>

       <div class="vignette">    
        <p>
            <narration>Zoe watches <book-title>Gone with the Wind</book-title>. </narration>
        </p>
          
        <p>
            <narration>Scarett is upset after a rejection. Rhett, who had been eavesdropping, emerges to mock her. He's dashing and absolutely charming. Scarlett ends the scene in tears.</narration>
        </p>  
          
        <p>
            <narration>Zoe smiles at Rhett's easy confidence.</narration>
        </p>
        </div>
            
        <p>When Rhett talks to Scarlett, the <term>audience</term> feels he's charming&mdash;but the <term2>character</term2> <callback>(Scarlett)</callback> feels he's repulsive and infuriating. We wouldn't want to be <sem-weak>exactly</sem-weak> like Rhett in real life&mdash;we'd be seen as repulsive and infuriating!</p> 
        
          <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-spectator-charm/18-05-0-rhett-spectator.png

    alt="This image shows a still from Gone with the Wind, where a well-dressed Rhett looms condescendingly over a flat-footed Scarlett. An arrow from the scene leads to a spectator entertainment diagram. It shows Rhett and Scarlett interacting together, and notes that Scarlett is repulsed. Through the screen, a spectator is watching and feels humor. Annotation notes that the spectator feels humor at the same time Scarlett is repulsed."
    title="Spectator charm"
    style="max-width: 25rem; margin-left: 1rem">
        
    <p>This split happens because <term>we</term> feel Rhett <humor-outcome>controls the situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handles criticisms</humor-outcome>, and so on&mdash;but <term2>Scarlett</term2> doesn't feel this. We take this split in stride because it's spectator entertainment.</p>
    
    <p>So while Rhett may be an example of how <term>characters</term> can be seen as charming&mdash;he's not a great example of how <term2>we</term2> can be seen as charming.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider> 
        
        <p>Stage make-up works really well on actors when we watch a play&mdash;but that doesn't mean  we should wear stage make-up to a work meeting!</p>
    </div>
    
<h5>The evaluatory situation of movies rewards larger-than-life characters</h5>    
    
    <p>
      When we're sitting on a sofa at home watching our favorite actor on TV, we have a large OK&mdash;we feel very secure from negative consequences. This large OK means that movies can play around with large mistakes, like with rogues, femmes fatales, anti-heroes, and so on who brashly bend or break the rules.</p> 
         
     <p>These characters generate large mistakes to balance with these large OKs, making audiences feel humor. This humor is why an audience considers the impossibly competent and carefree Rhett Butler as charming: we see him as <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizing</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>sharing personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport (with the readers or other characters)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling (Scarlett or other people's) complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>able support his arguments</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>
    It takes a roguish character to do this in <term>spectator entertainment</term>. But of course, in our <term2>own lives</term2>, where the OKs are not so huge and the active topics not so simple, it doesn't take impossible competence to generate fitted humor&mdash;just an achievable bit of awareness.<p> 
    
      <p>This is why we know a broad variety of charming people in our lives&mdash;none of whom are like movie characters in one-on-one conversations.</p> 
      
      <p>Instead, they may be teachers, coaches, cashiers, friends, uncles, and so on&mdash;who aren't movie characters but help us reach humor outcomes easily anyway.</p> 
      
      <p>We don't have to be charming like spectator characters&mdash;we have to be charming like the real charming people we know. Similarly, we won't find the characters we like in real life&mdash;because they're characters, not people!</p>

<div class="consider">    
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>A counterpart of this is understanding how our partner relates to characters like Rhett or Scarlett.</p>

         <p>Surreal attributes and actions work well in spectator templates, but don't straightforwardly transplant to interpersonal templates.</p> 
                
        <p>This is similar to how heavy stage makeup works well under bright lights from a distance. But just because it looks good to audiences for a staged production doesn't mean it would look good if we wore it to work.</p> -->
     
    


           <p>By broading our idea of the word "charm," we can see how taking walks or welcoming old friends is part of a charming life as well. It's the charming life we can be a <term>part</term> of and have in real life too, and not simply charm that we <term2>observe</term2> and not have in real life.</p>

<p>When we repeatedly feel fitted humor around someone or something, we think of them as charming.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
        When someone finds someone charming, that person has <a href="24-01-people-can-be-charming.html">social influence</a>&mdash;they're successful at using concordant mechanisms of influence. We experience this as appeal, appreciation, comraderie, enjoyment, friendship, love, and so on.</li>
    
    <li>Charmingness is something experienced by degree, which is why we can <a href="24-03-interpersonal-charm-is-different-than-spectator-charm.html">sort comparative</a> things by how charming they are. 
    </li>
    
    <li>We <a href="24-08-dl-spectator-charm.html">orient emotionally</a> toward fitted humor. We're drawn toward things that make us feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and other humor family words. Over time, this orientation gives us a long-term preference for charm over comedy.</li>
