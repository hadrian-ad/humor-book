<h3 id="27-02">We teach through humor attempts</h3>
      

<p>When we think of learning as humor, that means teaching becomes humor attempts.</p> 


<p>We can see this below, where the students learn more when Justin introduces mistakes on active topics and works to shift them to match an OK:</p>

    alt="Two evaluation graphs are compared, one where humor attempts aren't considered part of teaching and when where they are. If the mistake doesn't match the OK, the humor bush will shrink."

<p>When Justin thinks of his teaching as a series of humor attempts,  he’s better able to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (perspectives)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>share new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on. 
    </p>

<p>This is why his <term>successful</term> teaching generates humor, while his <term2>unsuccessful</term2> teaching does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast>.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>When the class <term>doesn’t</term> feel humor, it’s a bit like pouring water over a stone&mdash;the potential new framings or perspectives are <sem-weak>there</sem-weak>, but they just slide off. When the class <term2>does</term2> feel humor on a relevant topic, we can know the class is actually incorporating new framings.</p> </aside>
        
    </div> 
    
    
<p>When Justin’s class <outcome-contrast>doesn't</outcome-contrast> feel humor, we'd characterize the class with the <em>inverse</em> of humor tells, humor family words, and humor outcomes:</p>

<div class="list-in-text">
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>If the class showed <em>inverse</em> <strong>humor tells</strong>, they would have <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>low</outcome-contrast> energy</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>tension</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>sluggish</outcome-contrast> thinking</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>focus on the <outcome-contrast>future</outcome-contrast> (or past)</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>pessimism</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>social <outcome-contrast>avoidance</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>social <outcome-contrast>fragmentation</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>formal</outcome-contrast> behavior</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>disguising</outcome-contrast> personal views</emotion-tell>, and so on</li>.
         
        <li>If the class showed <em>inverse</em> <strong>humor family words</strong>, then instead of feeling <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, they’d feel <emotions><outcome-contrast>refusal</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>failure</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>frustration</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>boredom</outcome-contrast></emotions>, instead of <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>retrenchment</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions><outcome-contrast>stress</outcome-contrast></emotions>, and so on.</li>
         
        <li>If the class showed <em>inverse</em> <strong>humor outcomes</strong>, they’d feel that <humor-outcome>arguments have <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>tension has <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been eased</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives have <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been given</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>criticisms have <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been handled</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new topics of conversation have <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been opened</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>conflict has <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> been avoided</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
        </ul>
</div>
    
<p>We have a variety of words to describe a class with inverse humor tells&mdash;daydreaming, inattentive, lazy, listless, unenthusiastic, unmotivated, and so on. We can be more encompassing by simply saying these classes lack fitted humor.
    </p>

     <p><b>Concord.</b> Before, we talked about how humor was the mechanism of concordant influence&mdash;with "concord" etymologically meaning  <callback>"hearts (moving) together."</callback></p>

     <p>Concord is what makes humor outcomes <sem-weak>humor</sem-weak> outcomes.

These are coercive or inertial ways of "learning"&mdash;but in this book, there's only one <em>concordant</em> way to learn: humor.</p>      
     <p>Humor is how we feel an <humor-outcome>argument has been (concordantly) supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives have been (concordantly) gained</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>other ideas have been (concordantly) criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>complaints about other ideas have been (concordantly) handled</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>rapport has been (concordantly) created with us</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

     <p>It's this concord that produces feeling of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on, which constitute the flow of new perspectives through us, outside of coercion or inertia.</p>
