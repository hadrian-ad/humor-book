<p>You finished the book! Wow&mdash;I think congratulations are in order. It's no exaggeration to say that you know more about humor than almost anyone else alive. That's pretty neat!</p> 

<div class="consider">
       <aside class="consider">
        <p>You've maybe already started noticing this heightened awareness in action&mdash;you see casual instances of humor illiteracy in others in others, like explanations that don't go anywhere, or smiles that only you noticed.</p>
    </aside>
    </div>

<p>It’s my hope that, where it comes to humor, you feel your stance has improved&mdash;feet further apart, more stable-footed. And beyond that, that there's something dignified and wise in trying to think all this through.</p>

<p>And, happiest result of all (to me) would be if you felt the seed of harmony between yourself and the ideas in this book&mdash;catalytic insight that will grow and grow as you create your own self-sharpened, potent variation of what was described in this book.</p>

 <h3 class="forward">The natural unit of a smile</h3>
 
<p><book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> was an experimental textbook that was both exhilarating and exhausting to produce&mdash;the word passion comes to mind, meaning to <callback>“to struggle and feel pain.”</callback> It was a passion project!</p>

<p>This book was certainly long in the womb. It took over six years of writing, which was an effort of crazy synthesis of everything: my reading of vivid but strange books, my puzzling over shuttered dance halls, my community work through cafes and folk schools&mdash;and, looming over it all, the long feeling that something, something BIG, wasn’t quite right in everything.</p>

<p>Everyone has a different journey, but for me, good knowledge that encompassed dignity, joy, and wisdom was devestatingly hard to not just come by, but to come to agree with. I am sure I am not the only person my age who grew up with one foot in hustle-bootstrap-improvement culture and the other in joyless intellectualism. </p>

 <p> And so I wanted to share a step-by-step chain of reasoning, such that it might not just itself constitute this knowledge, but transmit it to others as well. A sort of walk in the woods feeling, where one comes back with an epiphany.</p>
 
  <p>What would lead to gentle acceptance of many of this books more dangerous ideas&mdash;like that smiles and laughter aren't just for comedy clubs, and aren't mysterious things we're exempt from caring about? That seeing <emotions>connection</emotions> is a vital part of living, and the downplaying of which is poor intellectual hygiene?</p>

<p>And so I tried to create human-scaled instruction in the much-downplayed natural unit of a smile&mdash;a unit of measurement whose absence has caused much amazement to so many people. <callback>(Amazement: "lost in a maze; unable to adjust ones own conditional structures.")</callback></p>

 
 <h3 class="forward">The lunar clarity of Warren Shibles</h3>

<p>I wanted to give some notes of gratitude to a very perculiar academic, Warren Shibles. He wrote many, many books on subjects like humor, emotions, ethics, aesthetics, lies, time, metaphor, death, language, and so on.</p> 

<p>He had a style of thoughts and writing that was normative-presenting but not. There was an autistic tilt to his styles and examples that gave everything an unfamiliar, almost otherworldly lense, with a simplicity of style that straddled trite and profound. He would casually drop world-challenging implications, and either disregarded or was incapable of reader-amenable polish.</p>



<aside class="consider">
    <div class="consider">
           <p>
            One of Shible's books was called <book-title>Time: A Critical Analysis for Children</book-title>&mdash;a book that would have deeply scarred me as a child, which I know because it kind of did as an adult.</p> 
            
            <p>Shibles tried to demonstrated the non-existence of time (as popularly understood) via stick figures drawn in MS Paint and somewhat frightening  phrases like <callback>"it's banana o'clock!"</callback>
        </p>
    </div>
</aside>

<p>His books were so <sem-weak>different</sem-weak>. I would read a few pages of his books and then stop and sulk for a week as I grappled with them. Eventually, I would digest them and elements of them would become part of me. I'd stop sulking, ead a bit more, and the process would repeat. </p>

<p>As a high schooler, I encountered Shibles’ book on humor, which was the parent to this book&mdash;I adopted his basic model for this book, and took it further in ways that made sense to me.</p> 

<p>I never met him, but a chance encounter with his self-published <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> (via Wikipedia citation) set me on a life of thinking and teaching about humor. Twenty years later, I am able to self-publish my own work&mdash;with gratitude to the self-publishers before me, including Shibles whose lunar clarity resonated so deeply to me.</p> 

<p>One of my goals was to stylize my book with more careful stewardship of human examples, with a more focused line of thought that I hoped would producing less sulking, and quite a bit more wonder.</p>

<h3 class="forward">Volume II on the horizon</h3>

<p>You deserve a rest after this book! However, I do want to give you heads up that many of the most interesting things are yet to come&mdash;including the broadest and most important conclusions. For practical reasons, including the limited scope of my one human life as well asu care of my readers, I've set aside much of this for Volume II.</p> 

<p>It’s my hope to put my drafts in good order and make them available&mdash;but of course who knows what the future brings? That's the quirky nature of the future.</p>
      
<h3 class="forward">Light at the window</h3>
<p>I always feel that, when we pull back the blinds to look at humor, we’re letting in more light from the window&mdash;and feel that the whole thing may be vaster and more varied that we had thought, in ways we already knew, but had never really stopped to think about.</p>

        Recapitulation
        </h5>
        
        
<p>This book detailed an analytical model of emotions, with an emphasis on humor. We learned to notice evaluatory information in the dynamics  between people, and developed standardized ways of verbalizing all this using ordinary language.</p>

<ul class="close-list">
     <li>Humor is an emotion that occurs in discoverable patterns</li>

            
<li>Humor refers to a broad set of possible configurations of behavior, which isn't limited to just smiling and laughing.</li>
                  
      <li>Humor is part of how we communicate information-assessments with ourselves and others.</li> 
      
      <li>Humor is acceptance, connections, insight, joy, and so on.</li>
      
      
      <li>Humor is the the mechanism of concordance.</li> 
      
      <li>Humor is  the emotional orientation of our lives.</li>
      
      </ul>
      

<p>This is one of many possible ways to talk  about positive emotions in our lives. It tries to balance the need for coherence, tangibility, and standardization with the requirement that we not lose sight of the soul of the thing.</p>
