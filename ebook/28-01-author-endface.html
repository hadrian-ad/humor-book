<p>You finished the book! Wow&mdash;I think congratulations are in order. It's an achievement!</p> 


<div class="consider">
       <aside class="consider">
<p>It's no exaggeration to say that, at this point, you know more about humor than almost anyone else alive. That's pretty neat!</p>
               
                <p>You've maybe already started noticing this heightened awareness in action&mdash;you see casual instances of humor illiteracy in others in others, like explanations that don't go anywhere, or smiles that only you noticed.</p>
    </aside>
    </div>

<p>It’s my hope that, where it comes to humor, you feel your stance has improved&mdash;feet further apart, more stable-footed. And beyond that, that you feel there's something dignified and wise in trying to think all this through.</p>

<p>And, happiest result of all (to me) would be if you felt the seed of harmony between yourself and the ideas in this book&mdash;that catalytic insight was planted that will grow and grow as you create your own self-sharpened, potent variation of what was described in this book.</p>


<h3 class="forward">The long look for something</h3>
 
<p><book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> was an experimental textbook that was both exhilarating and exhausting to produce. I had to write, illustrate, format, test, and do all the varied tasks that goes into creating a book&mdash;the word <sem-weak>passion</sem-weak> comes to mind, in its non-cant meaning of <callback>“to struggle and feel pain.”</callback> It was a passion project!</p>

<p>This book was certainly long in the womb. It took over six years of writing, which was an effort of crazy synthesis of everything: my reading of vivid but strange books, my puzzling over shuttered dance halls, my community work through cafes and folk schools&mdash;and, looming over it all, the long feeling that something BIG wasn’t quite right in everything.</p>
<!--
<p>Consider the word "happiness," which is a troublesome word. It's old sense is <callback>"an encounter, an event"</callback>&mdash;there are haps which happen in the happenstance. Someone that frequently has haps has happiness. In a poem by Thomas Hardy, life tells him that she never promised much, <callback>"just neutral-tinted haps and such."</callback></p>
 
<p>Today happiness means something like "bliss," which is one of those odd words like " passion</p>-->

 <h3 class="forward">The natural unit of a smile</h3>

<p>Everyone has a different journey, but for me, good knowledge that encompassed dignity, joy, and wisdom was devestatingly hard to come by. I had the double burden of struggling to digest the good knowledge I <sem-weak>did</sem-weak> come by&mdash;I am sure I am not the only person my age who grew up with one foot in hustle-bootstrap-improvement culture and the other in joyless intellectualism. In these frameworks, words like "acceptance" and "connection" were fuzzy terms outside the framework I used to understand the world, or replaced by creepy repackaging. <callback>("Brand loyalty.")</callback></p>
 
<p>As I found other systems of thinking, I started wonder what would better lead to gentle acceptance of some of the more dangerous ideas in the book&mdash;like that smiles and laughter aren't just for comedy clubs, and aren't mysterious things we're exempt from caring about? That seeing <emotions>connection</emotions> is a vital part of living, and the downplaying of which is poor intellectual hygiene?</p>

 <p>One of my goals was to create a step-by-step chain of reasoning, such that it might not just itself constitute good knowledge, but transmit it to others as well. I wanted readers to have a sort of walk in the woods feeling, where one comes back with an epiphany that they feel everywhere&mdash;the unquestioned sense that there's something new, elegant, and important, and the desire to go find or make more of that feeling.</p>


<p>And so I tried to create human-scaled instruction in the much-downplayed natural unit of a smile&mdash;a unit of measurement whose absence has caused much amazement to so many people. <callback>(Amazement: "lost in a maze; unable to adjust ones own conditional structures.")</callback></p>

 
 <h3 class="forward">The lunar clarity of Warren Shibles</h3>

         <div class="blockquote">

<p>There are very few books about the lie. In this respect it will be an adventure into the practically unknown. Once this world is entered no one will return the same as before.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="epigraph" style="margin-left: 11%"> &ndash; Warren Shibles, <book-title>Lying: A Critical Analysis</book-title></p>
</div>

<p>I wanted to give some notes of gratitude to a very perculiar academic, Warren Shibles&mdash;my sort of lifelong frenemy. He wrote many, many books on subjects like humor, emotions, ethics, aesthetics, lies, time, metaphor, death, language, and so on.</p> 

<p>While he continued to try to present his thoughts throughout his life in an academically normative style, he couldn't. There was an autistic tilt to his styles and examples that gave everything an unfamiliar, almost otherworldly lense. He had a remarkable independence from bodies of literature that others in his time had trouble stepping away from, and could casually drop world-challenging implications without any reader-friendly polish. He had a simplicity of style that straddled trite and profound.</p>



<aside class="consider">
    <div class="consider">
           <p>
            One of Shible's books was called <book-title>Time: A Critical Analysis for Children</book-title>&mdash;a book that would have deeply scarred me as a child, which I know because it kind of did as an adult.</p> 
            
            <p>Shibles tried to demonstrated the non-existence of time (as popularly understood) via stick figures drawn in MS Paint and somewhat frightening  phrases like <callback>"it's banana o'clock!"</callback></p>
            
            <div class="vignette">
               <p><speaker>Shibles:</speaker> <speech>"It seems that we have no evidence that there is such a thing as time. There are only clocks. And if there is no time, clocks cannot measure time. Clocks do not tell time. They tick but do not talk.</speech></p>
                </div> 
        
        <p>
            He had a tenacious love of precise language relatively free from pedantry and formal logic. You probably picked up on his influence in this book. <callback>("It is man tricking himself with time words which he misuses.")</callback>
        </p>
        
    </div>
</aside>

<p>His books were so <sem-weak>different</sem-weak>. I would read a few pages of his books and then stop and sulk for a week as I grappled with them. Eventually, I would digest them and elements of them would become part of me. I'd stop sulking, ead a bit more, and the process would repeat. </p>

<p>As a high schooler, I encountered Shibles’ book on humor, which was the parent to this book&mdash;I adopted his basic model for this book, and took it further in ways that made sense to me.</p> 

<p>I never met him, but a chance encounter with his monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> set me on a life of thinking and teaching about humor.</p> 

<p>I think about what enabled that to happen: Wikipedia, which shared a citation to Shible's book&mdash;and Shibles generously putting in the work to self-publish a reference book, as a pioneer explorer of the Internet late in his life. Twenty years later, I am also able to self-publish my own work&mdash;with gratitude to the self-publishers before me, including Shibles, whose lunar clarity of thought has resonated so deeply to me.</p> 

<p>One of my goals was to stylize my book with more careful stewardship of human examples, with a more focused line of thought that I hoped would producing less sulking, and quite a bit more wonder at where the paths can lead.</p>

<h3 class="forward">Volume II on the horizon</h3>

<p>You deserve a rest after this book! However, I do want to give you heads up that many of the most interesting things are yet to come&mdash;including the broadest and most important conclusions. For practical reasons, including the limited scope of my one human life as well as  care of my readers, I've set aside much of this for Volume II.</p> 

<p>It’s my hope to put my drafts in good order and make them available&mdash;but of course who knows what the future brings? That's the quirky nature of the future.</p>
      
<h3 class="forward">Light at the window</h3>
<p>I always feel that, when we pull back the blinds to look at humor, we’re letting in more light from the window&mdash;and feel that the whole thing may be vaster and more varied that we had thought, in ways we already knew, but had never really stopped to think about.</p>

        Recapitulation
        </h5>
        
        
<p>This book detailed an analytical model of emotions, with an emphasis on humor. Emotions were presented as evaluatory information, which drives human dynamics. We developed standardized ways of verbalizing all this using ordinary language.</p>

<ul class="close-list">
     <li>Humor is an emotion that occurs in discoverable patterns</li>

            
<li>Humor refers to a broad set of possible configurations of behavior, which isn't limited to just smiling and laughing.</li>
                  
      <li>Humor is part of how we communicate information-assessments with ourselves and others.</li> 
      
      <li>Humor is acceptance, connections, insight, joy, and so on.</li>
      
      
      <li>Humor is the the mechanism of concordance.</li> 
      
      <li>Humor is  the emotional orientation of our lives.</li>
      
      </ul>
      

<p>This is one of many possible ways to talk  about positive emotions in our lives. Some benefits of this model is how it balances coherence, tangibility, standardization, and usability with the requirement that we not lose sight of the soul of the thing.</p>
