<p>You finished the book! I think congratulations are in order&mdash;it's no exaggeration to say you now know more about humor than almost anyone else alive. That's pretty neat! (You'll probably start seeing humor illiteracy in others, if you haven't already: the smiles that only you notice, the inconsistent meanings to words, the dropped explanations, the narrow focuses.)</p>

<p><book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters: Volume I</book-title> was an experimental textbook that was both exhilarating and exhausting to produce&mdash;the word passion, meaning to <callback>“struggle and feel pain,”</callback> certainly was the case here.</p>

<p>This book was certainly long in the womb&mdash;over six years of writing, an effort of crazy synthesis from all my reading of vivid but strange books, my puzzling over shuttered dance halls, and my community work through cafes and folk schools&mdash;and the long feeling that something, something BIG, wasn’t quite right in everything.</p>

<p>Where was the knowledge that would give us greater dignity, joy, and wisdom? It was devastatingly hard to come by&mdash;and even then, could be hard to really come to believe in. So I tried to find and then share the step-by-step chain of reasoning that I believed might not just constitute this knowledge, but contribute it to others as well.</p>

<p>That meant creating human-scaled instruction in the much-downplayed natural unit of a smile&mdash;a unit of measurement whose absence has caused much amazement to so many people. <callback>(Amazement: "lost in a maze; unable to adjust ones own conditional structures.")</callback></p>

<p>It’s my hope that, where it comes to humor, you feel your stance has improved&mdash;feet further apart, more stable-footed. And beyond that, that there's something dignified and wise in trying to think all this through.</p>

<p>And, happiest result of all (to me) would be if you felt the seed of harmony between yourself and the ideas in this book&mdash;catalytic insight that will grow and grow as you create your own self-sharpened, potent variation of what was described in this book.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <p>In my own journey, I found nothing about anything in this book obvious prior to writing it&mdash;in fact, I had to overcome my extreme skepticism and initial dismissal toward its ideas.</p>
        
        <p>Like many people my age, who grew up (and sometimes enthusiastically participated) in an age of hustle, self-improvement, self-reliance, bootstraps, RoI-as-highest-good, deification of Great Men, carfication of life, civic ossification, private health insurance, and so on&mdash;learning to think about something like <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, and consider it on par with everything else, was immensely difficult&mdash;and involved quite a bit of pain in escaping some damaging animus in culture.</p>   
        
        <p>My goal was to channel my memory of my skepticism into a genuine pathway toward the gentle acceptance of many of its more dangerous ideas&mdash;like that smiles and laughter aren't just for comedy clubs, and aren't mysterious things we're exempt from caring about.</p>

<p>A very strange academic, Warren Shibles, was
my intellectual inspiration to so many things. He wrote many, many books on subjects like humor, emotions, ethics, aesthetics, lies, time, metaphor, death, language, and so on&mdash;and by many standards, these books were pretty awful.</p> 

<p>He had a simplicity of style that straddled stupid and profound&mdash;would casually drop world-challenging implications&mdash;disregarded or was incapable of reader-amenable polish to his books&mdash;and had an autistic tilt to his styles and examples that gave everything an unfamiliar, almost otherwordly lens.</p> 

<aside class="consider">
    <div class="consider">
           <p>
            One of Shible's books was called <book-title>Time: A Critical Analysis for Children</book-title>&mdash;a book that would have deeply scarred me as a child, which I know because it kind of scarred me as an adult.</p> 
            
            <p>Shibles tried to demonstrated the non-existence of time as popularly understood via stick figures drawn in MS Paint and somewhat frightening  phrases like <callback>"it's banana o'clock!"</callback>
        </p>

<p>His books were so <sem-weak>different</sem-weak>. I would read a few pages of his books and then stop and sulk for a week as I grappled with them. Eventually, I would digest them and elements of it would become part of me, and I would stop sulking. I’d read a bit more, and the process would repeat. </p>

<p>As a high schooler, I encountered Shibles’ book on humor, which was the genesis to this book&mdash;and whose basic model I adopted for this book. He set me on a life of teaching and talking about humor.</p> 

<p>I am profoundly grateful that he self-published <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>, which I encountered via Wikipedia&mdash;life-changing circumstances that inspire me, twenty years later, to self-publish my own work. One of my goals was to stylize a book through instruction and more human examples, in a way that could unfold the ideas further while producing less sulking, and quite a bit more wonder. </p>

<p>This book is just Volume I&mdash;while you deserve a rest, I should tell you that many of the most interesting things are yet to come, including the broadest and most important conclusions. For practical reasons, including care of my readers, I've set aside much for Volume II. It’s my hope to put my drafts in good order and make them available&mdash;but of course who knows what the future brings.</p>

<p>I always feel that, when we pull back the blinds to look at humor, we’re letting in more light from the window&mdash;and feel that the whole thing may be vaster and more varied that we had thought, in ways we already knew, but had never really stopped to think about.</p>

        Recapitulation of Volume I
        </h5>
        
        
<p>This book detailed an analytical model of emotions, with an emphasis on humor. We learned to notice and verbalize humor dynamics in interactions and information processing.</p>

<ul class="close-list">
     <li>Humor is an emotion that occurs in discoverable patterns</li>

            
<li>Humor refers to a broad set of possible configurations of behavior, which isn't limited to just smiling and laughing.</li>
                  
      <li>Humor is part of how we communicate information-assessments with ourselves and others.</li> 
      
      <li>Humor is acceptance, connections, insight, joy, and so on.</li>
      
      
      <li>Humor is the the mechanism of concordance.</li> 
      
      <li>Humor is  the emotional orientation of our lives.</li>
      
      </ul>
      

<p>This is one of many possible ways to talk  about positive emotions in our lives, which balances coherence and tangibility with a requirement to not lose sight of the soul of the thing.</p>
