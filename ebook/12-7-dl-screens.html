<p>Above, there's a <vocab>screen</vocab> that filters evaluatory information. This screen is the barrier that creates these different emotion networks.</p>

       <p>Spectator entertainment with <term>permeable</term> screens <callback>(like in-person performances)</callback> often gives us the feeling of <term>including</term> us, which makes them feel vivid and interesting. Things with permeable screens feel dynamic, and allow for  reactive participation.</p> 
       
       <p>By contrast, spectator entertainment with <term2>impermeable</term2> screens <callback>(like remotely viewed performances)</callback> often has the feeling of <term2>excluding</term2> us, which makes them feel lifeless or grating outside of specific circumstances.</p> </aside>
   
    </div>
   

     <p>We can see all kinds of evaluatory screens:</p>
      
    <ul class="close-list">
         <li>A play has a <em>pretend</em> screen, where the actors receive evaluatory information but, by-and-large,  carry on as if they didn't receive any</li>
          
          <li>A movie has as <em>absolute</em> screen, where the characters will never receive evaluatory information</li>
          
          <li>A tinted car window is a <em>removable</em> screen, where we could take an action to create a two-way flow of evaluatory information</li> 
          
          <li>An athletic game has a <em>concentration</em> screen, where participants need so much focus that they can't focus on the audience</li>
          
         
          </ul>
      
      <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
          


   
<p>An evaluatory screen doesn't mean something is spectator entertainment. Something is only spectator entertainment when the <em>priority</em> is on one group&mdash;and there may or may not be a screen.</p> 
             
<div class="consider"><aside class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
            <p>If a salesman flatters us, there <term>isn't</term> a screen&mdash;but since the priority is <em>us</em>, it <term>is</term> spectator entertainment. Similarly, if we watch street life from our window, there <term2>is</term2> an evaluatory screen&mdash;but since the priority <outcome-contrast>isn't</outcome-contrast> <em>us</em>, it <term2>isn't</term2> spectator entertainment.</p>
</aside>
    </div>    

    <p>Screens help us think about desynchronized evaluations.</p> 
            
                         
    <p>Usually, it's destructive to emotion networks when there are desynchronized evaluations&mdash;which is why groups break apart if some people laugh while others cry, and there isn't movement toward evaluatory synchronization.</p> 
              
       
<p>But when there <sem-weak>is</sem-weak> a screen, these desynchronized evaluations aren't immediately destructive&mdash;since it's not all happening on the same emotion network. Instead, we can laugh at a movie, memory, or people who can't receive our evaluatory information&mdash;and the screen allows this desynchronization to happen in a context that can feel free from the normal constraints of an emotion network.</p> 
    
         
    </div>
    
      
<!--
<p>This can help us think about why people may <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to go to small humor-generating environments, like a local comedy club, improv show, open mic night, regional film festival, underground theater, and so on&mdash;even if those things seem unappealing to us.</p> 

<p>People enjoy going to them for the same reason people like going to art films, indie bands, indie games, niche artists, small content creators, and so on&mdash;the less commercialized things are, the less they’re shaped by commercial design constraints.</p>

<p>The people who attend these things often experience them as authentic, cutting-edge, fresh, raw, relevant, resonant, vivid, or so on&mdash;it’s the same for a local artist or band as for a small-time humorist.</p> 


    <p>This is part of the appeal of user-generated content on forums as well, like memes, which allow for low-cost sharing of small-scale spectator entertainment.
    
      local humorist may make jokes about that specific restaurant&mdash;which provides something we won’t get from something more  commercialized.
    </p>
    

<p>Finally, the chance to <sem-weak>be</sem-weak> somewhere gives us a richer range of active topics and different bookending experiences of arriving and leaving.</p>

<p>By default, we are mutually reactive to each other and try to synchronize evaluations. However, when just a few members of an emotional system are prioritized, it becomes what we're calling <vocab>spectator entertainment</vocab>.</p>

<ul>
    
    <li>Actors, spectators, and characters can all have <a href="12-03-we-can-also-include-actors-as-a-group.html">different evaluations</a>.</li>
    
       <li>Spectator entertainment often allows for <a href="12-05-spectators-and-spectator-characters-are-usually-desynchronized.html">desynchronized evaluations</a>, allowing for distinctive situations and evaluations of them.</li>

    Spectator entertainment often scrambles our <a href="12-06-humor-family-words-are-present-in-spectator-entertainment.html">usual associations</a> between content and humor family words.
