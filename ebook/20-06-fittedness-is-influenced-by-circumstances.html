<p>Often, the wider circumstances change the fittedness:</p> 

<div class="vignette">

                <p><speaker>Jasper:</speaker> <speech>“Okay, okay. So here’s another joke. Let’s see. So there are two recovering alcoholics, right? And they sit down. And they’re like&mdash;let’s get our act together and finally be rock stars, like we always wanted. So they start trying to write a song. But they can’t get past the first two bars!”</speech></p>
                
                <p><narration>The audience guffaws. Sam laughs, but feels this joke is maybe lightly inappropriate here.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels there’s something a bit off about this joke)</notes></p>

             <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“I didn’t always want to be a professor. I wanted to be a singer once, you know, be in a band. So I tried to write a song once… but I couldn’t get past the first two bars!”</speech></p>
             
             <p><narration>Everyone groans, and a few people even laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Justin’s joke has relevant topics to him and his friends, and creates emotions of <emotions>release</emotions> and <emotions>acceptance</emotions>)</notes></p>

<p>Even though both Justin and Jasper had similar content in their joke, Justin’s humor attempt was more fitted to his listeners&mdash;since Justin had more contextual justification for his humor attempt than Jasper.</p>

   <aside class="box">
         <p><headline>Relation.</headline> Fittedness of a humor attempt isn't related to the intensity of humor&mdash;they're different measures of different things. It's a bit like how the <term>size</term> of a box and the <term2>weight</term2> of the box are different things.</p>
        
        <p>If someone shows us a small box and a big box, we won't know how heavy they. Similarly, if someone tells us in the other room they have one heavy box and one light box, we won't know the sizes of the boxes.</p>
        
        <p>It's similar for fittedness and intensity. Knowing fittedness doesn't tell us anything about intensity. If someone said Justin's joke was more fitted and told us nothing else, all we'd know is that it was more fitted&mdash;we don't know how intense the humor that was generated by it was.</p>
