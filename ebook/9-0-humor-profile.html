<p>In this chapter, we’ll talk about <vocab>humor profiles</vocab>.</p> 

<p>Humor profiles are <sem-weak>how</sem-weak> someone express humor&mdash;the specific <a href="8-0-humor-tells.html">humor tells</a> they tend to use when, at what intensity, and in what variation.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>For instance:</consider>
        
       <p>If we watch five friends watch a funny video, they may all feel humor at the same time&mdash;but they won't express humor in the same way.</p> 
       
       <p>If we watch those five friends watch a hundred funny videos, we'll see that each friend is consistent in the individual way they express humor.</p> 
       
       <p>The individual way each person expresses humor is their humor profile.</p>
   </aside>
    
    </div>
    
<p>Owen, Emma, and Zoe each express humor differently. These differences are their humor profile:</p>

<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote> <p><narration>Owen, Emma, and Zoe overhear something that makes them smile.</narration></p>
        
        <p><narration>Zoe gives a broad smile. </narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe’s humor profile is specific to her)</notes></p>
        
        <p><narration>Emma sets her face as she tries to prevent her smile. </narration><notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor profile is specific to her)</notes></p>
        
        <p><narration>Owen grins.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s humor profile is specific to him)</notes></p> </blockquote>
    
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote> <p><narration>Owen, Emma, and Zoe are doubled over at their table, laughing.</narration></p>
        
        <p><narration>Zoe is slouched in her chair, one hand on her face, another on Emma’s shoulder. Zoe’s shoulders shake as she goes</narration> <speech>“haaa haaa haaa.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe’s humor profile is specific to her)</notes></p>
        
        <p><narration>Emma keeps her elbows on the table, dropping her head while she laughs, her feet linked together, going</narration> <speech>“aha aha aha.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor profile is specific to her)</notes></p>
        
        <p><narration>Owen is flushed and has his hands clasped. He tends not to laugh very hard when he feels intense humor&mdash;he just smiles so hard his face hurts after.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s humor profile is specific to him)</notes></p> </blockquote>
    
    </div>
    
    
<p>We'll be talking about humor profiles throughout this chapter.</p>
    
 
    
<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Familiarity.</b> The more familiar we are with someone's humor profile, the more accurately we can draw inferences from their humor.</p> 
    
    <p>For instance, <term>Emma</term> and <term>Zoe</term> have seen Owen smile tens of thousands of times, which lets <term>them</term> interpret small variations in his smile. But a <term2>stranger</term2> seeing Owen smile for the first time wouldn't <term2>himself</term2> have the same comparative basis as Emma and Zoe.</p> 
        
    <p>This means the stranger likely interprets Owen's emotional state with less accuracy and nuance than Emma and Zoe.</p>
