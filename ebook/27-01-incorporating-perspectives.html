<h3 id="27-01">Humor is how we incorporate new perspectives</h3>
      
    
<p>We can be more precise about humor's role in "learning"&mdash;humor is the process of incorporating new perspectives or framings:</p>

<p>When Justin thinks of his teaching as a series of humor attempts,  he’s better able to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (perspectives)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>share new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on. 
    </p>

<p>This is why his <term>successful</term> teaching generates humor, while his <term2>unsuccessful</term2> teaching does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast>.</p>

When the class <term2>does</term2> feel humor on a relevant topic, we can know the class is actually incorporating new framings.</p> </aside>
