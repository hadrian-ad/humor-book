<h3 id="27-01">Humor is how we incorporate new perspectives</h3>
      
    
<p>We can be more precise about humor's role in "learning." Humor is the process of incorporating new perspectives or framings.</p> 

<p>We can see this in the class discussion below:</p> 


<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>
          
            <p><narration>Justin's class has been reading the classic novel, <book-title>Clouds over the Atlantic</book-title>. Exploring the themes of the book, he starts a discussion about the women’s suffrage movement.</narration></p> 
            
            <p><narration>To prompt the class to think about universal suffrage, Justin asks the class whether they think sixteen-year-olds should be able to vote.</narration></p>
            
            <p><narration>Most of the class doesn’t really have a strong opinion, but Trevor, who’s older than the rest of the undergraduates in the class, is appalled.</narration></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(appalled)</internalaction> <speech>“What? Sixteen-year-olds shouldn’t be able to vote!”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(amused)</internalaction> <speech>“Why not?”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“For a lot of reasons!"</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“What’s one?”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“Well, for one, sixteen-year-olds aren’t responsible!”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“So only responsible people should vote.”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“I don’t know. Maybe.”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“But <term>responsibility</term> is different than <term2>age</term2>, right? So if you’re concerned about ‘responsibility,’ why bring age into it?”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“But age is a fairly applied proxy for responsibility…”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“Ah!”</speech> <internalaction>(friendly irony)</internalaction> <speech>“You know, if we changed the law to prevent people under forty from voting, that would be both fairly applied, and even better at removing more irresponsible voters. Do you think that’s a good idea?”</speech></p>
            
            <p><narration>Some of the class are amused.</narration> <notes>(&larr;class feel an <humor-outcome>argument has been supported</humor-outcome>&larr;class incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;class learns&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <internalaction>(contrarily)</internalaction> <speech>“Maybe.”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(amused)</internalaction> <speech>“What if I said <sem-weak>you</sem-weak> couldn’t vote, on the argument that I thought most people your age were irresponsible? That would be unfairly punishing you based on my general opinion of others.”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“But that’s a totally different thing. I’m twenty-six. I have life experience. But sixteen-year-olds don’t even have mature <sem-weak>brains</sem-weak>. It’s just how things are.”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(delighted)</internalaction> <speech>“So this circles back to <sem-weak>women’s</sem-weak> suffrage! In the 19th and 20th century, there never were coherent arguments against the expansion of voting rights. When a man said it was about responsibility, women would point out that not all men were responsible, but that many women were. So why bring gender into it? So in the end, the public arguments always rested on assumed biological factors, and the assumed importance of them.”</speech> <action>*waving arms*</action> <speech>“’Well, their <em>brains</em> aren’t right!’ End of argument.”</speech></p>

            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels Justin <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>shared a new perspective</humor-outcome>&harr;&#xFE0E;Trevor incorporates new framings&harr;&#xFE0E;Trevor learns&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“I think you’re twisting things. That’s a false analogy.”</speech></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <action>*leans against desk*</action> <speech>“Maybe, maybe not! But it’s a <sem-weak>useful</sem-weak> analogy&mdash;Emma just mentioned that she couldn’t understand how so many men and women could be opposed to women’s suffrage. But we already <em>can</em> understand it, because we feel similar things today when we talk about letting sixteen-, thirteen-, ten-year-olds vote! We start relying on similar arguments, often because we feel that it’s <sem-weak>ludicrous</sem-weak>, we feel <sem-weak>dread</sem-weak> or a <sem-weak>loss of control</sem-weak>, that the social order will be <sem-weak>upended</sem-weak>&mdash;we say it’s unnecessary because of course the needs of sixteen-year-olds are <sem-weak>already</sem-weak> considered by eligible voters, that they are <sem-weak>biologically</sem-weak> in need civic caretakers. These feelings have been felt <sem-weak>whenever</sem-weak> the franchise was about to expand&mdash;whether to men without property, Black men, or to women. So, Trevor, I know I was being a bit unfair back there&mdash;but I wanted to show that we <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> feel something similar to what anti-suffragettes felt back then. Emma, does that maybe help you understand their mindset more?”</speech></p>
            
            <p><narration>Emma shrugs and gives a half-smile.

<p>Above, Justin helped his class tolerate and understand additional framings of things&mdash;something that was made possible through fitted humor.</p>

        <p>When we feel humor, we’re incorporating new perspectives. But just because we <humor-outcome>gain new perspectives</humor-outcome> doesn’t mean those perspectives will be important to us. We incorporate new perspectives that we think are terrible all the time!</p>
        
        <p>Humor doesn't indicate quality or importance of a perspective. Instead, the humor is both the process and signal of noting, tolerating, and understanding new perspectives.</p>

<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Humor bush.</b> Justin’s discussion with the class was successful in part because he had a pre-existing humor bush with them. That kind of discussion works when the class has <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> ability to reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> ability to be acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>some</outcome-contrast> ability to handle complaints</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Trevor felt comfortable <humor-outcome>revealing a personal view</humor-outcome> and trying to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (an idea)</humor-outcome>&mdash;just like Justin felt comfortable <humor-outcome>handling Trevor’s criticism</humor-outcome>. This comfort was pre-established through a humor bush. Without this humor bush, the class will be uncooperative and uninterested.</p>
