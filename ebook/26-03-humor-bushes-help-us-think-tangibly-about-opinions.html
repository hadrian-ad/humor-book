<h3 id="26-03">Humor bushes can demystify opinions</h3>

<p>Sometimes, we encounter advice, complaints, criticisms, evaluations, and so on that can seem arbitrary, confusing, mysterious, and so on. <callback>(“I just… like it.”)</callback></p> 

<p>It can be hard to think through these opinions:</p> 


<div class="vignette">
 <blockquote>
         <p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“What do you like about GrosTech’s music?”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*shrugs*</action> <speech>“I dunno. I just… like it.”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“It makes me uncomfortable that you like something but you can’t say why.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Alina struggles to make sense of opinions)</notes></p>
   </blockquote>
    </div> 

<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>  <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*complaining to Heather*</action> <speech>“Each semester some of my evals say that my courses are 'dull.' And that’s all they say! If they would just, you know, <sem-weak>use more words</sem-weak>, maybe I could understand what they mean!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin struggles to make sense of opinions)</notes></p> </blockquote>
    
    </div>
    
<p>Justin finds a characterization of his course as <callback>“dull”</callback> to be opaque. He thinks that if someone doesn’t connect <callback>“dull”</callback> to something specific, he can't know what the actual problem is.</p>

<p>But he doesn't actually <sem-weak>need</sem-weak> to know specifics to make sense of it. Instead, he needs to recognize it as an overall opinion&mdash;which is a humor bush. A humor bush isn't about any one thing specifically&mdash;it's about everything about his class.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>If the student actually disliked something in <term>particular</term>, they would have said something specific. <callback>(“The quiz formats were unfair.”)</callback> The student is instead conveying a <term2>general</term2> opinion, about everything.</p>
        
         
        
        <p>This general opinion is the general opinion <callback>(“dull”)</callback>, and can’t be replaced by specific anecdotes. In part, that's because there isn't just one problem and so isn't just one thing to fix&mdash;the student wishes they felt more <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. This is an open-ended problem with open-ended solutions.</p>
    </aside>
    
    </div>
    
<p>The student felt their humor bush with the class or with Justin was unfitted&mdash;they felt they didn’t feel enough humor family words or reached humor outcomes easily enough, and so had an overall negative opinion <callback>("dull")</callback>.</p>

 <aside class="box">
     <p><b>Feedback.</b> If we get an overall <term>positive</term> opinions <callback>("I liked it" "interesting" "great!")</callback>, we don’t usually think that these overall positive opinions are confusing, unknowable, or can’t be understood without specific examples. Instead, we take it as a holistic opinion.</p>
     
     <p>However, we sometimes do the opposite with an overall <term2>negative</term2> opinions <callback>(“dull”)</callback>! Instead of taking it holistically, we assume there must be specific things negative opinions refer to&mdash;and are maybe unknowable or not valid otherwise. But we should treat negative opinions like positive opinions&mdash;where overall opinions are seen as overall opinions.</p>
     
     <p>An overall opinion is an average of overall humor. The presence or absence of humor over <em>many</em> experiences composes our overall opinion of something, and we can't explain a humor bush through a single example.</p>
