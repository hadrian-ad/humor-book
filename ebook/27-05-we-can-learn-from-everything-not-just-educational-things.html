<h3 id="27-05">We can learn from anything</h3>



<p>While we <term>can</term> learn from educational books, homework assignments, instructive fables, podcasts, and so on, we don't <term2>always</term2> learn from them&mdash;and we don't <em>only</em> have to learn from these things.</p>

        <p>Sometimes we think some things are “educational” <callback>(Clouds over the Atlantic)</callback>, and other things aren’t <callback>(Pulp Fiction)</callback>. But when there’s fitted humor, it’s all the same process of learning&mdash;whether or not it’s associated with schools or universities.</p>
   </aside>
    </div>

  
<p>Fitted humor shows that we’re incorporating new framings or perspectives, no matter what the subject or circumstance:</p>

<p>In all these examples, people feel tension when they encounter new framings or perspectives. Humor shows that this tension isn’t ongoing, but has been resolved. This learning can happen anywhere&mdash;whether associated with school subjects or not.</p> 

<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Mistake handlers.</b> We find mistakes inherently interesting&mdash;which means we find interesting the people who can take mistakes and 
    
     <ul class="close-list">
        <li>characterize them</li>
         <li>describe them</li>
         <li>exaggerate them</li>
         <li>explain them</li>
         <li>influence them</li>
         <li>mitigate them</li>
         <li>point them out</li>
         </ul> 
     
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
     
     <p>This is part of the appeal of many authors, comedians, life coaches, podcasters, scientists, spiritualists, teachers, video essayists, and so on: they deal with mistakes in various ways, which we experience as learning.</p> 
     
     <p>We’re drawn toward people who make us feel the most fitted humor the most frequently&mdash;since fitted humor means we see them as elegantly handling mistakes, putting us in the Goldilocks zone of humor between mistake-predominant <callback>(<emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>confusion</emotions>, <emotions>worry</emotions>, and so on)</callback> and OK-predominant <callback>(<emotions>boredom</emotions>, <emotions>daydreaming</emotions>, <emotions>unenthusiastic</emotions>)</callback>. We experience this as learning and growing&mdash;as humor.</p>
     
         <p>We don’t always think to notice this humor until it’s pointed out&mdash;but then we see it everywhere. When our partner:</p>
     
     <ul class="close-list">
         <li>
             listens to their favorite podcast, they'll often <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>
         </li>
         
         <li>
             reads a nonfiction book that interests them, they’ll come to tell us about a passage <callback>(<humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>)</callback>
         </li>
         
         <li>watches a new video by a content creator they like, they’ll be <humor-tell>relaxed</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>loose</humor-tell> in their chair.</li>
     </ul>
     
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
     
     <p>This in turn grows a humor bush with those things, creating a positive overall opinion of them. We have a positive opinion of things that we feel grow our range of perspetives&mdash;that cause us to learn.</p>
