Accurately sampling humor
</h3>

     <p>For many of us, when we hear the word "humor" we think of spectator entertainment&mdash;like jokes, memes, satires, comedies, comedians, and so on.</p>  

<p>While these things can be fun and wonderful&mdash;we also don't want to have a <em>bias</em> toward those things. If those were the only things we looked at, our understanding of humor would be lopsided.</p>

<div class="consider">

        <p>If we wanted to study warfare, we would lose our grounding if we <em>only</em> studied movies set in wartime.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, if we wanted to study smiling and laughing, we would also lose our grounding if we <em>only</em> studied comedies.</p> </aside></div>

<p>Where do we <em>actually</em> smile and laugh in the world, outside of spectator entertainment? Until it's pointed out, we often don't notice all the places we do:</p>

        <p><narration>Justin stops by Heather's place unexpectedly. Heather beams with delight to see him, and they embrace, smiling.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

<p>Above, we can see people laughing and smiling in a way that arise out of day-to-day situations&mdash;in ways that aren't always clearly represented in surreal spectator entertainment.</p>

<p>By being able to see and think about humor as it happens spontaneously, we'll be able to improve at a variety of skills that require spontaneous action in actual emotional systems. These are skills like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>connecting with strangers</li>
    <li>delighting our partner</li>
    <li>leading a group</li>
    <li>supporting a struggling friend</li>
    <li>defusing an argument</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To understand these moments well, we have to be able to set aside spectator humor&mdash;and see the situation with clear reality.</p>
   
<div class="consider">
     <aside class="consider">
         <p>  We know that <term>reading</term> about a feast isn't the same thing as <term>being</term> at a feast&mdash;or <term>preparing</term> one. Similarly, <term2>watching</term2> strangers meet isn't the same thing as <term2>meeting</term2> them. </p>
                    
             <p>For the same reason, <term>watching</term> a witty conversation isn't the same thing as <term>participating</term> in a witty conversation&mdash;just like <term2>watching</term2> someone delight their partner isn't the same thing as <term2>delighting</term2> our partner.</p> 
                                
                    
             <p>By seeing these as apples and oranges, we reach a higher competence in assessment and ability.</p>

    <p><b>Disillusionment.</b> While today, the word "illusion" has connotations to magic, mystery, deception, tricks, and so on, the etymology of the word actually comes from play&mdash;it meant <callback>"in play."</callback></p>
    
    <p>A modern variation would be that football players on the field created the illusion of football <callback>(are in play)</callback>, or that children playing doctor are composing an illusion <callback>(are in play)</callback>.</p>
     
    <p>This makes an illusion some kind of coherence that everyone is making a shared effort to abide by.</p> 
     
     <p>And similarly, the word "disillusioned" has the sense of exiting play&mdash;or, with the modern connotation included, of being expelled unwillingly from something whose coherence we came to question.</p>

<p>We've been using the word "surreal" as being familiar and good enough. But it's not a very clear word. In this book, something is as "surreal" as the effort needed to create and sustain it.</p>

<p>A play is surreal for not being spontaneous&mdash;a lot of effort goes into the two hours of a play. and an emergency would have it dissipate immediately.</p>
