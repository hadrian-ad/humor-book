Accurately sampling humor
</h3>

     <p>For many of us, when we hear the word "humor" we think of surreal things&mdash;like jokes, memes, satires, comedies, comedians, and so on.</p>  

<p>While these things can be fun and wonderful&mdash;we also don't want to have a <em>bias</em> toward those things. If those were the only things we looked at, our understanding of humor lopsided.</p>

        <p>If we wanted to study warfare, we would lose our grounding if we <em>only</em> studied movies set in wartime.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, if we wanted to study smiling and laughing, we would also lose our grounding if we <em>only</em> studied our favorite comedies.</p> </aside></div>

<p>Where do we <em>actually</em> smile and laugh in the world, outside of spectator entertainment? Until it's pointed out, we often don't notice all the places we do:</p>

    </blockquote>

<p>Above, we can see people laughing and smiling in a way that arise out of day-to-day situations&mdash;in ways that aren't always clearly represented in surreal spectator entertainment.</p>

<p>By being able to see and think about humor as it happens spontaneously, we'll gain access to improving at a variety of skills that require a spontaneous touch, like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>connecting with strangers</li>
    <li>delighting our partner</li>
    <li>leading a group</li>
    <li>supporting a struggling friend</li>
    <li>defusing an argument</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To understand these moments well, we have to be able to set aside spectator humor to be able to see the situation with clear reality.</p>

         <p>  We know that <term>reading</term> about a feast isn't the same thing as <term2>being</term2> at a feast. Similarly, reading about a terrible event isn't the same thing as living thorugh that terrible event.</p>
                    
             <p>For the same reason, <term>watching</term> a witty conversation isn't the same thing as <term2>participating</term2> in a witty conversation&mdash;just like watching someone delight their partner isn't the same thing as delighting our partner.</p> 
                                
                    
             <p>We can't compare ourselves to&mdash;or straightforwardly learn from&mdash;surreal standards. Being able to compare apples to oranges correctly here matters in reaching a high competence in assessment and ability. </p>

    <p><b>Play.</b> The word illusion is an interesting one&mdash;and today has connotations with magic, mystery, deception, tricks, and so on. Of course, the etymology of the word gives a clearer picture&mdash;illusion came from a word that means "in play."</p>
      
        <p>So football players have their illusion thorugh their game&mdash;children arranging dolls are composing an illusion&mdash;we pretend or daydream about being someone else through illusion. We're in play.</p>
                  
        <p>It's not that illusions that are bad themselves&mdash;since they're not. Instead, it can be bad when we're caught unaware by them. Then we risk the feeling of disillusionment&mdash;the sense of being expelled from a game we didn't know we were part of.</p> 
     
        <p>Even if we're not disillusioned, when we don't quite realize what's <em>pretended</em> coherence and what isn't&mdash;our thinking can become slanted in ways that make interacting with others harder than it has to be.</p>

<!--
<p>We've been using the word "surreal" as being familiar and good enough. But it's not a very clear word. In this book, something is as "surreal" as the effort needed to create and sustain it.</p>

<p>A play is surreal for not being spontaneous&mdash;a lot of effort goes into the two hours of a play. and an emergency would have it dissipate immediately.</p>
