	Since at first it can seem odd to think of humor family words <em>as</em> humor, we'll go through some of our humor family words one-by-one.</p> 
	
	<p>We'll see that these words are all humor&mdash;all moments where we evaluate mistakes as OK:

        <narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore when she picks up a book on meditation. She reads the book title: <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are</book-title>. She thinks about that for a second, puzzled.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>Then something clicks. She laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>realization</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> 
    </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	Zoe laughs after reading a book title: her mistakes and OKs shift in a way that generates humor. In context, we can describe this specific instance of humor as
	<emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on. These are all different words that describe the same thing: humor.

<p>
	When mistakes and OKs are balanced, we often describe this humor in context as <emotions>realization</emotions>:
