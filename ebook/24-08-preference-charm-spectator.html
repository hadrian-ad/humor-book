<h3 id="24-08">We have a long-term preference for spectator charm.</h3>

<p>We have a long-term preference for charming people in our <term>interpersonal interactions</term>&mdash;we have a long-term preference for charming things in <term2>spectator entertainment</term2> too.</p>

<p>When we think back to our favorite entertainment over the years, the things that come to mind are usually things with lots of charm to them:</p> 



<p>For instance, we might have fond memory of media about:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>sponges and squids that deal with work and boredom in different ways</li>
    <li>office workers who are dysfunctional but endearing</li> 
    
    <li>families in a small town with a nuclear power plant</li>
    <li>doctors during a war</li>
    <li>a space crew of mercenaries and passengers</li>
    <li>washed up and depressed animals past the peak of their careers</li>
    <li>friends travelling between elemental nations</li>
    <li>a sad cop who lost his memory and talks to himself a lot</li>
    <li>puppets and people that live on the same block</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>



        <p>It was the charm mixed into the comedy that kept these things meaningful to us over longer periods of time&mdash;for the same reason it's the charm that makes us remember friends or strangers years later.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>
<p>It wasn’t that they weren’t <term>ever</term> comedic&mdash;it was instead that they could at least <term2>occasionally</term2> stop prioritizing intensity and take time to prioritize fittedness instead.</p>
   
   <p>When this entertainment gives us feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, and so on and helped us reach humor outcomes, we say it struck a chord with us.</p> 
    </aside>
    </div>




<p>By contrast, the things that were primarily comedic might take more effort to remember. We might have watched a show about talking cat butts years ago, and felt like we were about to die of laughter&mdash;but as we change, or the cultural context around us changes, we might forget about it, and our memory of it isn’t straightforwardly positive.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
       <p>Between two equally intense moments of humor, we’ll have a preference for the one with greater fittedness. That’s because we’d rather feel intense humor we'd describe as <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on than intense humor we wouldn't.</p>

        <p>This is why it can be odd to show our romantic partner our favorite internet videos from when we were in high school&mdash;we may suddenly see them as mean, niche, nostalgic, old, random, pointless, weird, or so on. They don’t always hold up well as we change.</p> 
        
        <p>By contrast, old videos that prioritize fittedness often hold up better than videos that don’t.</p>

<p>Emma and Zoe found this memorable in part because of the humor family words they felt having watched it together&mdash;they have positive memories of <emotions>connection (with each other)</emotions> with each other.</p> 

<p>But their relation to the comedy attempt itself is more ambiguous. The show itself is relatively unimportant compared to their experience with each other&mdash;and had they watched it by themselves they may not have found it memorable at all.</p>

<aside class="box"><p><b>Emotional Orientation.</b> This long-term preference charm isn't surprising. We saw earlier  how fittedness was involved with group efficiency and cohesion. That means <term>charm</term> often marks constructive moments in our lives&mdash;and things that were <term2>charming</term2> were so consistently constructive that they mark almost architectural aspects of our lives. </p>
      
      <p>In part, that's because humor family words are the emotional orientation of our lives. We emotionally orient toward <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
      
      
      <p>All things being equal, we try to emotionally orient ourselves around or in pursuit of humor family words&mdash;which means we orient toward the people, moments, memory, things, and so on that we find charming.</p> 
      
      <p>The things that support these experiences are the architectural support of emotional lives&mdash;whether people, pets, gardens, memories, views, and so on. </p>
