Topics track mistakes and OKs, not humor
</h3>
  
<p>
	Topics track mistakes and OKs. These evaluations <term>can</term> generate humor, but don't <term2>always</term2>. 
</p>
<p>
	Some of our topics may never generate humor at all&mdash;like how the topic ‘houseplant’ might never produce any humor our entire lives:

    title="An evaluation graph without humor"
    alt="This evaluation graph has the label 'houseplant' and has a very large OK and a very small OK."
    style="max-width:20rem;">


<p>
	But once we estimate the size of the mistake and OK on a topic, we have the information we need to try to generate humor from them.
</p>
<p>
	For instance, since ‘houseplant’ has a large OK, we could try using a large mistake to generate humor. We could: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li class="indepth">
		pretend it's a therapist and talk to it
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		focus on it to try to see it in new light
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		pretend our houseplant is a reincarnated white pine
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		give it a name like Augusta or Lord Grom
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		take many pictures of it wearing a scarf and share them with a friend
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
<p>
	These would be larger mistakes that may match the large OK&mdash;and so generate humor.

    alt="This evaluation graph is labled 'houseplant.' It starts with a large OK and small mistake. A is labeled 'we give our houseplant a name' and the mistake rises to meet the OK. when it dips, it rises again to balance with the OK at B, which is labeled 'we decide our houseplant is a reincarnated pine'"

<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Effort.</headline> Sometimes it doesn't seem to take effort of our own to feel humor&mdash;like when we watch comedic movies, and feeling humor is almost automatically. We don't feel involved in generating our own humor.</p>
         
        <p>Things are a bit different with something like a houseplant&mdash;since involving a houseplant in feeling humor isn't automatic, but often takes effort and initiative.</p>
        
        <p>But once we can generate humor from something like a houseplant, we can generate humor <sem-weak>anywhere</sem-weak>, on any topic&mdash;since <em>any</em> topic can have balanced mistakes and OKs.</p>
