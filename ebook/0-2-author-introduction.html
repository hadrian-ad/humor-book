    <p>One of my favorite books, <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>, took something I thought was very obvious and not at all in need of a book about it <callback>(sitting)</callback>&mdash;and then <sem-weak>bam</sem-weak> hit it with a lightning bolt. A touch of catalytic insight, and everything was different.</p> 
       
<!--    <p>It wasn't that I had never sat before. Instead, it was like my awareness had been sleeping. A touch of catalytic insight electrified my heap of observations, and I felt awake to what I had been seeing all along.</p>-->
        
    <p>This book aims to do something similar, but for humor. There are things to point out that, once seen, can't be unseen&mdash;and the world as we experience it will be transformed.</p> 
    
    <p>We'll be covering humor in its full breadth: the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p>   

    <p>I am a humor teacher. What I do isn't exactly the same thing as teaching people to be "funnier." Instead, I guide people through systems that help them understand, organize, and be aware of their own lifelong experiences with humor.</p>
    
     <p>While I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer, my interest has always been in reknitting people together&mdash;and in the large-scale social reconstruction needed to heal places and people from the loneliness epidemic that's hollowed out life in North America.</p>
    
    <p>As I volunteered, worked, and observed in this context, I was continually struck by the need almost <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> had for humor education. From teachers to engineers; teenagers to parents, most people were unable to answer basic questions like <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback>&mdash;to say nothing of more complex, integrated skills around humor, which were off the table entirely.</p>
    
    <p>The lack of a humor science has been a root obstacle that makes it hard for  us to even just <sem-weak>describe</sem-weak> a world of alienation, to say nothing of working to disinvest places of alienation. This is an obstacle this book hopes to shrink.</p>
    
    <p>Okay&mdash;elephant in the room. Most of us grew up with no instruction in humor, and are suspicious of the whole idea that it can be taught at all. This rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things: there are supportive art courses <callback>(even though art is personal)</callback>, and deep places to go through geometry <callback>(even though squares are intuitive in some ways)</callback>. It's the same for humor, which can be both profoundly personal and intuitive while <em>also</em> being supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>
     
     
<p>It's not an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects that's the least taught. The result of this is widespread illiteracy in humor, which often leads to becoming overburdened by backfill explanations from comedy.</p> 
    
<p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere. It comes as:</p> 
    
  <ul class="close-list">
       <li>  periodic confusion or missed information</li>
        
        <li>a loss of practical skills around connection and understanding</li>
        
        <li>poor design choices that struggle to see people clearly</li>
        
        <li>a sense of powerlessness that comes from being told that very real things <callback>(laughter, smiling)</callback> are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account</li>
        </ul>
        
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people. I've found that people are ready for the stability, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>
    
<p>To get this serious instruction, this book is arranged like a course. It's not  a quick summary: I want you to actually learn to think with these systems, with some subtlety and flexibility. That's why we'll progress through 27 cumulative chapters, and look at over 600 examples and 300 figures.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn productive theories of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p>

        <p>I want to clarify a few things that this book is not. First, it's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>Second, this isn't a book about neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, commercialization, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research&mdash;and of what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>
    </aside>
</div>
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. By the end of this book, I hope you'll come to see, as I do, that the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
