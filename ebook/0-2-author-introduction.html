    <p>One of my favorite books, <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>, took something I thought was ostensibly obvious and settled&mdash;chairs, sitting&mdash;and then <sem-weak>bam</sem-weak> hit me with a lightning bolt. A small amount of catalytic insight touched a lifelong pile of inert observations, turned them alive.</p>
        
    <p>I'm sure you can see where this is going. This book assumes you have piles and piles of experiences of people laughing and smiling, including yourself. And then I'll guide you through some systems that help you find clarifying perspectives. This includes a number of things that, once pointed out, can't be unseen.</p> 
    
    <p>We'll cover humor in it's full breadth&mdash;the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! As we go through all this, you'll probably smile.</p>   

    <p>I am a humor teacher. While I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer, my interest has always been in reknitting people together&mdash;and in the largescale social reconstruction needed to heal individuals and places from the loneliness epidemic in much of North America.</p>
    
    <p>That's a big subject, but as I volunteered or worked in this field, I was continually struck by the need for humor education&mdash;for everyone. This includes the people I meet who haven't spoken to a stranger in years, the gregarious couple that loves dinner parties, the traffic engineers who design roads, and so on. It's knowledge needed for everyone.</p> 
    
<p>Not only are most people unable to answer basic questions like <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback>, more complex, integrated skills around humor are off the table entirely. It's a foundational difficulty connected to all kinds of problems.</p>
    
    <p>It's normal to grow up with no instruction in humor. But it's a shame! It's not an exaggeration to say that humor is probably the most important subject in the world that's the least-taught. Just look at the ratio of calculus classes to humor classes in schools.</p> 
    
    <p>Partly, the elimination of even the <sem-weak>idea</sem-weak> that there should be humor education rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
<ul class="close-list">
       <li><term>Art</term> is personal&mdash;but there are still useful art courses that support or start someone's art. </li>
        
        <li><term2>Squares</term2> are intuitive&mdash;but there's still deeper places to go in a geometry class.</li> 
        </ul>
    
    <p>Just because everyone is a bit different and the processes are intuitive, it doesn't follow that there's no good guidance possible. This is undersood for art and geometry&mdash;humor, less so. The result is generational illiteracy of humor, often overburdened with backfill from comedy.</p> 
    
    <p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere. At their most general, these consequences includes a loss of practical skills around connection and understanding, as well as a sense of powerlessness from being told that very real things <callback>(laughter, smiling)</callback> are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account.</p> 
    
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people. I've found through my students and community that people are ready for the power, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p> 
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. We'll learn elegant and productive theories of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
