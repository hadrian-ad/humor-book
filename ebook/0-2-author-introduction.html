    <p>One of my favorite books, <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>, took something I thought was obvious, complete, and settled <callback>(sitting)</callback>&mdash;and then <sem-weak>bam</sem-weak> hit it with a lightning bolt.</p> 
       
    <p>It wasn't that I had never sat before. Instead, it was like my awareness had been sleeping. A touch of catalytic insight electrified my heap of observations, and I felt awake to what I had been seeing all along.</p>
        
    <p>This book aims to do something similar, but for humor. There are things to point out that, once seen, can't be unseen&mdash;it leads to a transformed world.</p> 
    
    <p>We'll be covering humor in it's full breadth: the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p>   

    <p>I am a humor teacher. What I do isn't exactly the same thing as teaching people to be "funnier." instead, I guide people through systems that help them clarify, organize, and be aware of their own lifelong experiences with humor.</p>
    
     <p>While I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer, my interest has always been in reknitting people together&mdash;and in the largescale social reconstruction needed to heal places and people from the loneliness epidemic that's hollowed out life in North America.</p>
    
    <p>As I volunteered, worked, and observed in this context, I was continually struck by the need almost <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> had for humor education. Not only were most people unable to answer basic questions like <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback>, but more complex, integrated skills around humor were off the table entirely.</p>
            
    <p>The lack of a humor science was a foundational difficulty. It created or made worse all kinds of problems, including underpinning a world invested with alienation.</p>
    
    <p>While it's normal to grow up with no instruction in humor, it's still a shame! It's not an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects in the world that's the least taught.</p> 
    
    <p>For most people, there isn't even the <sem-weak>idea</sem-weak> that there should be humor education. This rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things: art is personal, and squares are intuitive&mdash;and yet there are still supportive art courses, and deeper places to go through geometry. It's the same for humor, which can be both profoundly personal and intuitive while <em>also</em> being supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>
     
    
    <p>The result of absent instruction in humor is generational illiteracy in humor, often overburdened with backfill from comedy.</p> 
    
    <p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere. It comes as periodic confusion or missed information&mdash;a loss of practical skills around connection and understanding&mdash;and a sense of powerlessness that comes when we're told that very real things <callback>(laughter, smiling)</callback> are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account.</p> 
    
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people. I've found through my students and community that people are ready for the power, insight, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>
    
<p>To get this serious instruction, this book is arranged like a course. It's not just a quick summary: I want you to actually learn to think with these systems! That's why we'll be looking at over 600 examples and 300 figures as we progress through 27 cumulative chapters.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn elegant and productive theories of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p>

        <p>I want to clarify a few things that this book is not. First, it's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>Second, this isn't a book about neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, business models for comedy, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research&mdash;and of what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking. This gives us a base for any other specialized routes we may or may not want to take later.</p>
    </aside>
</div>
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. As I hope you'll also come to see by the end of this book, I think the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
