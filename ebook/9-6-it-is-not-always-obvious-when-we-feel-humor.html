Our humor isn't always obvious

<p>While our <term>high-intensity</term> humor is often <term>obvious</term> to us <callback>(we fall to the floor, laughing)</callback>, <term2>low-intensity</term2> humor can happen without us even <term2>noticing</term2>:</p>

<p>Alina, Zoe, Minh, and Emma were feeling humor without some abstract "humor-feeling" inside them. In fact, other people were more aware of their humor than they were themselves!</p>

<p>Humor doesn't require our awareness or a "mind-feeling" before it's humor. Instead, if we're showing humor tells, consistent with our overall humor profile, then we're feeling humor.</p>

        <p>Sometimes we think our emotions should be obvious&mdash;but they're not always obvious.</p> 
       
        
        <p>Our emotions are flexible and sometimes changing patterns of behavior elements&mdash;with each element having many variations and degrees of intensities.</p> 
        
        <p>With so many possible configurations of these patterns, it's not surprising our emotional state isn't always obvious!</p> </aside>

<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Internal humor tells.</b> We've mostly been talking about <term>external</term> humor tells. But we also can feel <term2>internal</term2> humor tells&mdash;physical sensations that are often not clear to observers.</p> 
    
    <p>These internal humor tells may be:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>an upward feeling from our stomach to our head, almost like there’s rising gas or upward internal pressure</li>
        <li>a tingling in our cheeks as the muscles tense before or during a smile</li>
        <li>a drawback under the skin in our chest</li>
           
           
            <li>an uncurtaining feeling in our stomach</li>
            <li>an awareness of a specific part of the inside of the head</li>
        <li>a shift up or down by our vocal chords</li>
        <li>a downward flushing feeling from our cheeks to our lungs</li>
        <li>an expansion in the soft palette of our mouth</li>
        <li>a twinge in the muscles around our nose</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p>When we think of a "feeling" to humor, we're often referring to these internal humor tells.</p> 
        
        <p>But these internal humor tells don't need to be present or noticed by us in order for us to experience humor&mdash;for the same reason <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell> doesn't need to be present or noticed by us in order for us to experience humor.</p>
