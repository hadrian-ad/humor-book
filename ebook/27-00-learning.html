<p>Last chapter, we looked at how fitted humor and humor bushes together constituted our <a href="26-00-opinions.html">opinion</a> of something. 


<p>In this chapter, we'll look at how fitted humor and humor bushes are involved in <vocab>learning</vocab>. Humor is how we learn&mdash;when we learn, we feel humor.</p>

     <p><b>Learning.</b> We don’t always notice the relation between humor and learning, in part because we often only notice humor where we expect to find it. We'll scan ourselves for humor while watching a <term>comedy show</term>, but not while doing <term2>math homework</term2>.</p>
     
     <p>But once it’s pointed out, we notice that we <sem-weak>do</sem-weak> feel humor from solving math problems, which isn't surprising&mdash;since <em>any</em> kind of problem generates mistakes and lowers our OK.</p>
     
     <p>Our mistakes and OKs start to balance as we come to understand and eventually solve a problem. This is true for bouldering, delivering jokes, solving math problems, working through logic puzzles, encountering riddles, packing boxes, way-finding, and so on&mdash;all of which generate humor for similar reasons.</p>
     
     <p>If we <sem-weak>don't</sem-weak> feel humor at math homework, it's because we feel it's rote busywork, or because we feel we're flailing through it. But when we're actually overcoming problems, and gaining insight, and feeling things click into place&mdash;we feel humor.</p>
