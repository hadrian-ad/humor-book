<p>Last chapter, we looked at how fitted humor and humor bushes together constituted our <a href="../20chapter-opinions/20-00-opinions.html">opinion</a> of something. 


<p>In this chapter, we'll look at how fitted humor and humor bushes are involved in <vocab>learning</vocab>.</p>

<p>Humor is how we learn&mdash;when we learn, we feel humor. More specifically, humor is the process of incorporating new perspectives or framings:</p>

<p>In order to effectively create new perspectives and framings in his students, Justin thinks of his teaching as a series of humor attempts. When he does this, he’s better able to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (perspectives)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>share new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on. 
    </p>

<p>This is why his <term>successful</term> teaching generates humor, while his <term2>unsuccessful</term2> teaching does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast>.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>When the class <term>doesn’t</term> feel humor, it’s a bit like pouring water over a stone&mdash;the potential new framings or perspectives are <sem-weak>there</sem-weak>, they just slide off them. When the class <term2>does</term2> feel humor, we know our class is actually incorporating new framings.</p> </aside>

     <p><b>Learning.</b> We don’t always notice the relation between humor and learning, in part because we often only notice humor where we expect to find it. We'll scan ourselves for humor while watching a <term>comedy show</term>, but not while doing <term2>math homework</term2>.</p>
     
     <p>But once it’s pointed out, we notice that we <sem-weak>do</sem-weak> feel humor from solving math problems. This isn't surprising&mdash;since <em>any</em> kind of problem generates mistakes and lowers our OK.</p>
     
     <p>As we come to understand and eventually solve a problem, we shrink the mistake and raise our OK, and eventually they'll balance. This is true for bouldering, jokes, math problems, logic puzzles, box packing, riddles, way-finding, and so on&mdash;all of which generate humor for similar reasons.</p>
     
     <p>When we <sem-weak>don't</sem-weak> feel humor at math homework, it's because we feel it's rote busywork, or we feel we're flailing through it. But when we're actually overcoming problems, and gaining insight, and feeling things click into place&mdash;when we're learning and incorporating new perspectives&mdash;we feel humor.</p>
