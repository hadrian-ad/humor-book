<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at <vocab>spectator entertainment</vocab>&mdash;things were the emotional <em>priority</em> is on spectators: </p>

<p>When Xiaowei does a funny waddle, what he cares most about isn't how <term>he</term> feels&mdash;it matters most how the people <term2>spectating</term2> feel.</p>

<p>Since Xiaowei's <em>priority</em> is on the experience of the spectators, waddling is spectator entertainment.</p> 
   
   <p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.

         <p><headline>Priorities.</headline>      
            
            We can think about the difference between an <term>interpersonal</term> orientation or a <term2>spectator</term2> orientation by thinking about the difference between competitive wrestling and dramatized wrestling:</p> 
             
             <ul>
                <li><strong>Competitive wrestling</strong> is intense and interesting to <term>participants</term>&mdash;but not always as interesting to <term2>spectators</term2>. Casual spectators might see the wrestlers in odd-looking helmets and uniforms locked in a static grapple for a long time before something happens quickly and the match is over.</li> 
                 
                 <li><strong>Dramatized wrestling</strong> is designed to be intense and interesting to the <term>audience</term>&mdash;and how the <term2>participants</term2> feel is less important. In order to better commercialize wrestling, showrunners staged and performed scenes in a way that was easy to follow, exciting, visually stimulating, and so on&mdash;for the <sem-weak>audience</sem-weak>.</li>
                 </ul> 
        
        <img src="../images/12c-images-spectator-entertainment/12-0-spectator-entertainment/12-0-2-differences.png"
        
        title="Interpersonal wrestling versus spectator wrestling"
        alt="This comparison shows two variations. In the first column, spectators are watching two people in competition wrestling, and the wrestlers are focused on each other. In the second column, spectators are watching two showman wrestlers who are focused on the audience."
        style="max-width: 42rem; margin-left: "
        >
        
        <p>Even though they both might be called "wrestling," the priorities make them different.</p>
