<p>Last chapter, we looked at <a href="25-00-humor-bushes.html">humor bushes</a>&mdash; our humor over time. In this chapter, we'll look at how humor bushes are our <vocab>opinions</vocab>.</p> 

<p>Our opinion of something is based on our humor bush with it. This is obvious when we think about Emma’s relation to her university:</p>

<p>This means the size of Emma’s humor bush will correspond to her opinion of her university.</p>

    alt="This figure has a circle of time filled with humor dots, represented by a large humor bush. This corresponds to Emma's good opinion of her university. Next to it is a comprasion, with only one humor dot over time, corresponding to a small humor bush. It shows Emma has a bad opinion of her university."

    <p>We can also use asymmetric and mutual humor bushes with abstract or inanimate things. Emma has an asymetric humor bush with her university, since the university doesn't feel much humor toward her in return. When she returns to campus, she feels more <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on than the institution does to her in return. This is what many alumni notice sharply when they return to campus years later.</p>
           
    <p>This is in contrast to visiting distant relatives many years later. If Emma spent a summer with them, they'd grow a mutual humor bush. And so when she returns, they both feel mutual amounts of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mbash;even if it happens years and years later.

<p>This is something we'll be looking at throughout this chapter.</p> 

 
 <aside class="box">
     <p><b>Places and things.</b> At first, it can seem odd to talk about growing a humor bush with something abstract or inanimate&mdash;like a university. But it’s not that odd once we think about it.</p> 
        
     <p>We also become fond of comedic movies, games, mementos, people, toys, and so on when they generate humor in us&mdash;our humor constitutes our good opinion of them. The same is true for broader things, like cities or universities.
         </p>

<!-- 
<div class="box">
    <p><b>Humor family words.</b> Last chapter we mainly used humor outcomes to talk about humor bushes. <callback>("have they created <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>strong</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, or <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>weak</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>?")</callback> But we can <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> use <em>humor family words</em> too. <callback>("do they feel <outcome-contrast>strong</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, or <outcome-contrast>weak</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>?")</callback>.</p>  
    
     
    
    <p>Often, humor family words are helpful when thinking about the humor bushes we have with places and institutions&mdash;like how whether Emma likes her university or not depends on how often she experiences  <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>If over time, she characterizes her experiences as <outcome-contrast>complete</outcome-contrast> <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <outcome-contrast>frequent</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishments</emotions>, <outcome-contrast>constant</outcome-contrast> <emotions>insight</emotions>, <outcome-contrast>overall</outcome-contrast> <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on, she’ll have a large humor bush with the university&mdash;and a good opinion of it.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>By contrast, if she feels <emotions>rejection</emotions> <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions>acceptance</emotions>)</callback>, <emotions>failure</emotions> <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>)</callback>, <emotions>boredom</emotions> <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions>insight</emotions>)</callback>, <emotions>fear</emotions> <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions>safety</emotions>)</callback>, and so on, she’ll have a very small humor bush with the university&mdash;and a bad opinion of it.</p>
