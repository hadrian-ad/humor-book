    <p>In this book, we'll be assembling one way of thinking about humor&mdash;a model of humor.</p> 
    
    <p><term>Last</term> chapter we had:</p> 
    
     <p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion</p>

<p><term2>This</term2> chapter we had:</p>

<p class="lesson">Humor is a mistake that's evaluated as OK</p>

<p>We can connect these together for our current model of humor:</p>

     
<p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion that someone feels when they evaluate a mistake as OK</p>   
 
 
<p>This is the start of our  <vocab>model definition</vocab> of humor. We'll keep adding and refining it as we go along.</p>

 <p>A model is something that simplifies something more complex&mdash;a bit like how a map simplifies what it's mapping. Since you can't hold a 1:1 map of Canada in your hand, you simplify how you represent Canada until it meets your needs. 
</p>

   
   <div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>

                                        
                      <p>A <term>map</term> of Canada is a <term>map</term>, not Canada. In the same way, a <term2>model</term2> of humor is a <term2>model</term2>, not humor.</p> 
                               
                       <p>We can map Canada in all kinds of ways. These different maps aren't wrong&mdash;instead, our <sem-weak>choice</sem-weak> of map can right or wrong, depending on our task or goals. It's the same for models&mdash;including models of humor.</p>
                  </aside>
         
     </div>
       
<p>Our goal is to make a usable "map" of humor that lets us navigate, explore, and use humor in our day-to-day life.</p>
        
<p>This isn't the only way to model humor&mdash;but we'll see that this model helps us reflect on conversations, make creative decisions, describe experiences well, support meaningful insight, and so on.</p>
    

    </div>

                 <div class="chapter-end"><p>That's it for this chapter!</p> 
    </div>
                        
    <div class="chapter-summary">
    
    
    <h4 class="chapter-summary" id="chapter-2-defining-summary">Chapter summary</h4>
    
    <p>We introduced our model definition of humor. This model uses two input parameters: a <vocab>mistake and an OK</vocab>. We also described these inputs as coming from a person&mdash;they're <vocab>evaluations</vocab>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong><a href="2-1-what-do-we-mean-by-mistake.html">mistake</a></strong> is something that deviates from our expectations. A mistake isn't "good" or "bad"&mdash;it's just about how something relates to our expectations.</li>
        <li>Our <strong><a href="2-2-what-do-we-mean-by-ok.html">OK</a></strong> is how secure we feel from personal negative consequences. An OK doesn't mean we're "okay with" something bad happening. It's just how we're relating ourselves to negative consequences.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="2-3-what-do-we-mean-by-evaluated.html">Evaluations</a></strong> create these mistakes and OK. This means someone is required for there to be humor. Without an evaluator, there's no mistake or OK&mdash;and so can't be humor.</li>
        </ul>
