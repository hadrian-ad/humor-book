Humor family words can happen over time
</h3>
  <p>
	Sometimes, <emotions>acceptance</emotions> is an emotion that happens over a long timescale:

    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(meanly)</internalaction> <speech>“Huh. Nice set on her too. Are you sure that didn’t have anything to do with it? Maybe we should take a look at your phone to see!”</speech>

        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Then delete it and don’t do it again!”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(angry)</internalaction> <internalaction>(retaliating)</internalaction> <speech>“You’re the one that fucking chased Sara off!

        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*goes back to her laptop*</action> <speech>“Fuck you.”</speech>

    </div>
<p>
	To track what’s going on, we’ll use two main topics for Owen:
</p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none;" >
   <li>[1] ‘Emma’s characterization of Owen’</li>
    <li>[2] ‘Owen’s characterization of Emma.’</li>
    </ul>
<p>
In both these topics, the mistake oversizes the OK, generating mistake-predominant emotions: 
</p>

    title="Two topics are involved"
    alt="This image shows two topics as circles, with arrows leading to their respective evaluation graphs. One graph is labeled 'Emma's characterization' and the other as 'Owen's characterization.' In both graphs, the mistake is larger than the OK."
    style="max-width:32rem;">

<p>
	If Owen succeeds in shrinking the mistake and growing the OK in ‘Emma’s characterization,’ he’ll eventually feel humor&mdash;which we can describe as <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, and so on:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        
            <narration>Owen walks around campus after Emma called him out. Her comments about him being a creep bounce around his head. He wasn’t really being a creep, was he?</narration></p> 
            
            <p><narration>He pulls out his phone to look at the photo he had taken of the woman. As he scrolls through his camera roll, he sees several photos like this on his phone. He looks at them for a while, and finally he closes out and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>acceptance</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <speech>“What a creeper. Ah, fuck me.” </speech>
    </p>

    <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/7c-images-humor-family-words/7-8-acceptance-as-humor-ii/7-8-1-emma-and-owen-topics-.png"
    title="Two topics are involved II"
    alt="This image shows the evolution of the previous graph. The evaluations in the topic 'Emma's characterization' have moved into balance, generating humor on that topic. A diagram links 'mistake is OK' to 'humor' to 'acceptance.'"
    style="max-width:33rem;">

<p>
	Above, <term>one</term> active topic is generating humor&mdash;he feels <emotions>acceptance</emotions>. But the <term2>other</term2> active topic is still generating mistake-predominant emotions&mdash;so Owen is feeling both humor and regret.</p> 
	
	<p>Before Owen can fully reconcile with Emma, he’ll need to feel humor on the other topic too.
</p>
<div class="consider"><aside class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>
            Emma will have to do something similar on her end&mdash;to reconcile with Owen, she’ll also need to eventually feel humor from her evaluations on two topics.</p>
            
            <p>Both Emma and Owen will need to feel mutual humor with each other before they have a full, mutual reconciliation.
