<p>We have a long-term preference for charm. Comedy tends to be only transiently important to us.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>We saw this in miniature when Brad attended Zoe's student art gallery. Years later, Zoe probably wouldn't remember any puns that Brad made there <callback>(“got your oil shop up and running!”)</callback>&mdash;but she probably <sem-weak>would</sem-weak> remember him helping her feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions> and <emotions>achievement</emotions> <callback>(“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”)</callback>.</p>
        
        <p>The pun made a transient impression, but the affirmation&mdash;specifically the humor family words it led to&mdash;formed a durable impression.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>This long-term preference for charm and "charmingness" is true for both our interpersonal lives and in spectator entertainment. </p>



<h4>We have a long-term preference for <outcome-contrast>interpersonal</outcome-contrast> charm.</h4>

<p>When we think about the people felt the most connection with throughout our life, it’s usually the people who have made us feel the most <em>fitted</em> humor. Similarly, it's usually people we found charming that we wished we had gotten to know more.</p>

 

<p>By contrast, if we think back to the various social eras of our lives and try to remember the funny one of the group, we may realize we haven’t thought of them in a while:</p>



<div class="vignette">
   <blockquote>
         <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Hey. Remember Josh B.?”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*puts down fork*</action> <action>*puts head in hand*</action> <speech>“Oh my god. Josh B.! I haven’t thought of him in ages.”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Do you think he really drank that bottle of pee, or was he just joking?”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“I have no idea. I just remember him singing hundred bottles of beer in AP Lit. Mrs. Gardiner was <sem-weak>pissed</sem-weak>.”</speech></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

 

<p>At the time, Zoe and Emma may have giggled at Josh B. along with everyone else&mdash;but when they remember him years later, they forget the intensity and mainly remember the unfittedness.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>Josh focused single-mindedly on intensity of humor, without any concern for fittedness. He made funny remarks at the serious parts of movies; undercut sincere moments with meta-commentary; only wanted to watch outrageous comedies; chased pranks for pranks' sake, and so on.</p> 
           
           <p>He fixated on using intensity as a measure of good humor, which was at odds with the more varied way people around him <sem-weak>actually</sem-weak> determined good humor.</p>
    </aside>
        
</div>
 

<p>Josh may have noticed that even though people <term>laughed</term>, he didn't really form lasting <term2>connection</term2> with them&mdash;like with Emma or Zoe. That's because it's <sem-weak>fittedness</sem-weak> that leads to connection and cohesion&mdash;if Josh doesn't at least sometimes priotize fittedness, he won't be creating much connection and cohesion.</p> 

<p>This is why class clowns often only feel tenuously integrated with the people they make laugh&mdash;and tend to be excluded easily or forgotten quickly.</p>
     

<p>By contrast, memories of <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on tend to persist, since we recall those experiences easily. Years later, Emma and Zoe probably fondly remember moments of kind smiles or unsolicited moments of help.</p>



<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>
          <p><narration>When Zoe was a freshmen, she dropped her notebook and someone swooped down and picked it up, handing it to her with a smile. Zoe smiles back.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>For some reason, it sticks with her, even now as a senior.</narration> <notes>(&larr;memories of <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>



<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Remember when you got ‘Best Foam Rollercoaster’ in sixth grade?”</speech></p>
        <p>Emma: <action>*smiled*</action> <speech>“Proudest day of my life!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;memories of <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>

        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Of course! She was so nice.”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“She drew me a picture for my birthday in fifth grade!

<p>Sandra’s charm attempts weren’t as flashy as Josh's humor attempts&mdash;but Josh's comedy attempts faded in importance over time, while Sandra’s charm attempts persisted as positive.</p> 

<p>Since humor family words and humor outcomes persist in our memories, in a way that the intensity of humor usually doesn't, we have a long-term preference for charm.</p>



<h4>We have a long-term preference for <outcome-contrast>spectator</outcome-contrast> charm.</h4>

<p>When we think back to our favorite entertainment over the years, the things that come to mind are usually things with lots of charm to them.</p> 

<p>It wasn’t that they weren’t <term>ever</term> comedic&mdash;it was instead that they could at least <term2>occasionally</term2> stop prioritizing intensity and take time to prioritize fittedness instead.</p>


<p>When this entertainment gives us feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, and so on and helped us reach humor outcomes, we say it struck a chord with us.</p> 

<p>For instance, we might have fond memory of media about:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>sponges and squids that deal with work and boredom in different ways</li>
    <li>office workers who are dysfunctional but endearing</li> 
    
    <li>families in a small town with a nuclear power plant</li>
    <li>doctors during a war</li>
    <li>a space crew of mercenaries and passengers</li>
    <li>washed up and depressed animals past the peak of their careers</li>
    <li>friends travelling between elemental nations</li>
    <li>a sad cop who lost his memory and talks to himself a lot</li>
    <li>puppets and people that live on the same block</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>



<p>It was the charm mixed into the comedy that kept these things meaningful to us over longer periods of time&mdash;for the same reason it's the charm that makes us remember friends or strangers years later.</p> 

<p>By contrast, the things that were primarily comedic might take more effort to remember. We might have watched a show about talking cat butts years ago, and felt like we were about to die of laughter&mdash;but as we change, or the cultural milieu changes, we might forget about it, and our memory of it isn’t straightforwardly positive.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
       <p>Between two equally intense moments of humor, we’ll usually have a preference for the one with greater fittedness. That’s because we’d rather feel intense humor we'd describe as <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on than intense humor we wouldn't.</p>

        <p>This is why it can be odd to show our romantic partner our favorite internet videos from when we were in high school&mdash;we may suddenly see them as mean, niche, nostalgic, old, random, pointless, weird, or so on. They don’t always hold up well as we change.</p> 
        
        <p>By contrast, old videos that prioritize fittedness often hold up better than videos that don’t.</p>

<p>Emma and Zoe found this memorable in part because of the humor family words they felt having watched it together&mdash;they have positive memories of <emotions>connection (with each other)</emotions> with each other.</p> 

<p>But their relation to the comedy attempt itself is more ambiguous. The show itself is relatively unimportant compared to their experience with each other&mdash;and had they watched it by themselves they may not have found it memorable at all.</p>

<aside class="box"><p><b>Emotional Orientation.</b> This long-term preference for things we find or found charming isn’t surprising. We saw last chapter how fittedness was involved with group efficiency and cohesion. That means <term>charm</term> often marks constructive moments in our lives&mdash;and things that were <term2>charming</term2> were so consistently constructive that they mark almost architectural aspects of our lives. </p>
      
      <p>In part, that's because humor family words are the emotional orientation of our lives. We emotionally orient toward <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
      
      
      <p>All things being equal, we try to emotionally orient ourselves around or in pursuit of humor family words&mdash;which means we orient toward the people, moments, memory, things, and so on that we find charming.</p>
