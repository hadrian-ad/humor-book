<p>At first, it can seem like we should care more about high-intensity humor  than low-intensity humor&mdash;but that's not really the case. We can see this by thinking about "low-intensity" colors.</p> 
 
 <p>In our heads, the sky is often the most vivid blue imaginable. But when we actually look at the color of the sky, it's a pale and thin blue: </p>

<!--
 <p>A book about color would help us think through all this in different contexts, including answering questions like:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
  
   <li>what makes blues different from each other? How do we describe them?</li>
   
   <li>when is a pale blue might be preferable to a sharper blue, and why?</li>
        
    <li>what makes colors work harmoniously together or not?</li>
    
    <li>why someone might chose the colors they did, and what does that mean about them or their goals?</li>
    </ul>

    Alt="This picture of the sky highlights the pale, washed out blue of the sky. An annotation says that focusing on vivid colors not often in nature would make it harder to understand the world around us."

    <p>It's not that the experience of seeing the sky can't be vivid&mdash;it's that the sky can be vivid <em>and</em> be pale and thin.</p>

   <p>The same is true all across our lives. When we have vivid experiences, we assume there were more vivid colors than there actually were:</p>
    

    <img
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-1-meadow-color.jpg"
    Title="Meadow"
    Alt="This picture shows a meadow with a European manor in the background. The meadow has a pale sky, lots of brownish green, and some yellow flowers."
    style="max-width: 26rem;"
    > 
    
    <p>When asked to remember a beautiful field, we'd probably remember "intense" colors. But when we actually take a <sem-weak>look</sem-weak> at fields, we often see more muted colors than we expect, including brown greens and pale blues.</p>
    
    <p>Similarly, while we may remember the field as draped in yellow from flowers, that effect was actually created by just few scattered flowers&mdash;since it doesn't always take much yellow to create a vivid impression.</p>
    
    <p>That's because a lot of our assumptions about the association between color, vividness, and experiences aren't quite right&mdash;and we have to switch from describing what we <term>expect</term> to see to what we <term2>actually</term2> see.</p>
    
    <p>In other words, we'd want a book about color to help us think about how colors and the world worked <em>everywhere</em>&mdash;and to help us think accurately about all "intensities" of color.</p>

    Title="All shades of blue are interesting"
    Alt="This comparison shows two different hues of blue, and notes that a book on color would be interested in both of them."
    style="max-width: 15rem;"
    > 


      <p>A study of <em>only</em> "high-intensity" colors would remove us from common experiences, like living under the sky&mdash;and mainly equip us to think about a narrow range of things.</p>
      
      <img
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-3-animated-sky-comparison.png"
    Title="We often misremember colors"
    Alt="This image compares a picture of an animated sky, which is a saturated blue, with the previous picture of the sky, which is a washed out blue. An annotation says we often remember the sky as it looks in created things, not how it looks in the world."

<p>This is all true of humor as well. While belly laughter may stand out in our memories, the majority of the humor in our lives actually happens at a low-intensity.</p> 

<p>Low-intensity colors can seem washed out in a comedy, but be vivid in a field. In the same way, low-intensity <em>humor</em> can seem washed out in a <term>comedy</term>, but be vivid and intense in other contexts of our <term2>lives</term2>.</p> 

<p>And in the same way just a bit of <term>yellow</term> made a big difference in the field above, just a bit of <term2>humor</term2> makes a big difference in an emotional state&mdash;like how a little bit of orange below makes a big difference:</p> 
  
  <img
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-4-dots-of-orange.png"
    Title="Little bits of color matter"
    Alt="This comparison shows an all-blue box and an all-blue box with a dot of orange in it. An annotation says these two boxes aren't the same."
    style="max-width: 17rem;"
    > 
  
<p>Even though the orange is "less" compared to the blue, that doesn't mean the orange isn't relevant. To understand colors and make aesthetic decisions, we'd have to take the presence or absence of this bit of orange seriously.</p>

<p>Something similar happens for emotions. <callback>"Anger"</callback> and <callback>"anger with a bit of humor"</callback> are not the same emotional states, and we have to take the presence or absence of a bit of humor seriously:</p> 

<img

    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-5-dots-of-humor.png"
    Title="Little bits of emotion matter"
    Alt="This comparison shows two emotional state boxes, one with all-anger, and the other all-anger with a bit of humor in it. An annotation says these two boxes are not the same."

<p>This book will be focusing on humor everywhere, of any intensity&mdash;and focusing on understanding what that humor means. This will give us genuine understanding of humor as it happens anywhere and everywhere in the world.</p>

    <p>
    Humor isn't just "on" or "off." Instead, it's something that has degrees of intensity. We can model <vocab>intensity</vocab> by thinking of mistakes and OKs as having a magnitude.
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>
        We can intuitively sort comparative mistakes and OKs by <strong><a href="3-1-mistakes-have-a-size.html">magnitude</a></strong>. This magnitude is the degree that something deviates from our expectations <callback>("size" of mistake)</callback>&mdash;or the degree that that mistake feels secure from negative personal consequences <callback>("size" of OK)</callback>. 
    </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
    <li>
        The magnitude lets our inputs <callback>(mistake, OK)</callback>
        return a ratio output. We feel humor most <strong><a href="3-3-humor-is-most-intense-when-the-sizes-of-mistakes-and-OKs-match.html">intensely</a></strong> when the ratio of mistake and OK is 1.
    </li>
    </ul>
    
    <ul>
    <li>
        We feel less intense humor in proportion to <strong><a href="3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor.html">how far</a></strong> the ratio of our evaluations is from 1.
    </li>
    </ul>
