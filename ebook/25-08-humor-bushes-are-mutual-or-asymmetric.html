    <h3 id="25-08">Humor bushes are mutual or asymmetric</h3>



<p>Emma and Zoe feel equally frequent and intense humor around each other, so their humor bushes aren’t asymmetric, but mutual:</p>

    style="max-width: ; margin-left: ; margin-top: .5rem;" 
     >

 

<p>By contrast, the humor bushes are asymmetric when people <em>don't</em> equally feel humor around each other:</p>

  <img src=../images/19c-images-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric/19-08-1-jasper-sam-asymmetric.png
    

    alt="Jasper has a small humor bush, and Sam has a large humor bush";
    title="Asymmetric humor bush";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: ;margin-top: .5rem;" 
     >




<p>Sam and Jasper have asymmetric humor bushes. Since Jasper is a stand-up comic, Sam lights up every time he thinks about Jasper. But since Jasper has never formally met Sam, Jasper never thinks about Sam, let alone feels humor from him.</p>  

<p>Humor bushes can be mutual or asymmetric, but whether this is fitted or unfitted depends on the situation.</p>

<p>Sometimes an asymmetric humor bush is part of how we do our job. For instance, a Heather wants her students to feel more humor than they make her feel in return:</p>

    style="max-width: 26rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: .5rem;" 
     >


 

<p>Heather wants to be able to <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (students)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support her arguments (to the students)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>(have more) control of a situation, deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, and so on&mdash;but she doesn’t want to let the students do the same to her in the same proportion.</p>

          <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>Just because two sides laugh doesn’t mean there are mutual humor bushes. Heather might make <sem-weak>herself</sem-weak> laugh, along with her students&mdash;but this is <term>Heather</term> growing a humor bush with <term>herself</term>, and not the <term2>students</term2> growing a humor bush with <term2>Heather</term2>.</p>
    </aside>
    </div>
    
<p>Other times, asymmetric humor bushes aren’t as positive&mdash;like how Elias often helps Jessica feel humor, but less often lets Jessica help him feel humor:</p>

        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Always cracks himself up, does he?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma notices Elias laughs because of himself more than he laughs because of Jessica)</notes></p>

<p>When someone isn’t aware of the asymmetry, it can be a sign of manipulation&mdash;or a source of inaccurate observations:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
       <blockquote>
           <p><narration>The barista flashes Owen a grin.</narration></p>

            <p>Owen: <internalaction>(delighted)</internalaction> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“You know me too well!”</speech> 
            
             <p><narration>She goes to make the maple cappuccino.</narration></p>
            
            <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(thinking)</internalaction> <speech>“That barista and I have <sem-weak>chemistry</sem-weak>! Wonder if she’s single?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen mistakes an asymmetric humor bush for a mutual humor bush)</notes></p>

<p>Owen’s error is in thinking that <term>his</term> humor bush is the same size as the <term2>barista’s</term2> humor bush&mdash;but since Owen feels much higher intensity and longer duration humor then the barista does, they actually have <em>asymmetric</em> humor bushes.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>Owen and the barista do feel <em>mutual</em> humor together&mdash;but their mutual humor bush is capped at the smallest bush of the two.</p>
        
         
        
        <p>To use a quantification metaphor, if Owen has a “7” humor bush with the barista, and the barista has a “3” humor bush with Owen, the mutual humor bush is capped at the lowest (3) and isn't the highest (7).

        <p>If Owen thinks they mutually share 7, not 3, he can lose track of their actual social relationship.</p>
