    <h3 id="23-11">A second case study of charm</h3>   

  <p>We can look at another, similar instance&mdash;this time from a memory, not from a romantic comedy:<p>

<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Emma is browsing a forum. One of the topics is a call for strong sexual memories of someone you never had any physical contact with.</narration></p>
         
        <p><narration>She reads one of the most popular ones:</narration></p>
          
           <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Poster:</speaker> I (male) was taking a scuba diving class in my university. There was a stunning redhead with a amazing body. We never spoke in class. Fast forward to the end of the school year. We are diving for 2 days at a lake doing the checkout dives. One day 1 as I am exiting the water she is entering the water and said something to like “hurry up you are holding me up” I have no idea why but my response was “Fuck you” in a playful tone. She smiles and responds “OK”. My mind is blown. Class ends and she said. I’ll see you tomorrow. The next day she did not make it to class because she was involved in a car accident. She had injuries that kept her from diving. So yeah. Never saw her again. It’s been 23 years and I still remember that sexy redhead in the white two piece.
            </p>

<p>This example is similar to the scene with the priest: both women in these examples had a similar sentiment <callback>("don't hold me up")</callback>, which was followed by a high-velocity charm attempt. <callback>("Fuck you")</callback></p> 

<p>As before, we can relate the diving student's comment to the emotional sitution. He wasn't trying to make her laugh for laughter's sake&mdash;it was to reach humor outcomes. He wanted to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle her complaint</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on. Since these outcomes were his <sem-weak>priority</sem-weak>, it was a charm attempt.</p> 



<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>Charm references an outcome <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>, not a way of getting there. So even though this specific delivery of "fuck you" generated fitted humor in <sem-weak>this</sem-weak> case, that's no guarantee it would in others.</p> 
        
        <p>Moreover, a sharp comment isn't the only possible thing that would generate humor. We could imagine a laugh, wink, gift, and so on as all potentially being different paths to the same outcome&mdash;since all those things could lead to moments where evaluations were balanced.</p>
    </aside> 
    </div>


<p>And also like with the spectator entertainment scene, we can use humor outcomes and humor family words to make sense of how the the diving students saw the situation&mdash;her smile showed <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on, and their <sem-weak>mutual</sem-weak> humor <humor-outcome>created (mutual) rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed (mutual) personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>(mutually) symbolized ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>The diving student remembers this high-velocity charm attempt as successful&mdash;which may or may not be how the woman remembers it.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>We don't always have a way of talking or thinking about these moments of humor in our day-to-day life. The poster doesn't say <callback>"something funny happened"</callback> or <callback>"I made a joke"</callback>&mdash;even though the hinge of the story was that she smiled.</p>
  
<p>All across our lives, we tend to talk about humor and humor attempts when the intention is laughter for laughter's sake&mdash;even as we ignore or don't know how to talk about more complex emotional actions that involve humor. Charm helps us expand where and how we think about humor.</p>
      
   <div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>The man indicated a humor attempt in his story by describing his "playful tone." In this book, "play" is another way of indicating a humor attempt, since when we play, we're trying to intentionally shift mistakes and Oks into balance.</p> 
        
        <p>But this gives play the same problem as "humor attempt"&mdash;it doesn't indicate priorities. To formally specify, we can characterize these humor attempts with words like charm or comedy.</p>
   </aside>
    </div> 


   
<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Troubleshooting.</b>     <term>If</term> the diving student's high-velocity charm attempt had been unsuccessful, we could use our components of humor to think about <term2>why</term2> it was unsuccessful. This involves thinking about:</p>
        
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>the relevancy of the active topics</li>
      
        <li>whether the humor outcome being rushed was actually on a relevant topics</li>
      
        <li>how rushing those topics relates  to efficiency and cohesion</li>
    </ul>
      
      <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
       
    <p>We can also just think about mistakes and OKs. If someone feels a deviation from the expected <callback>(mistake)</callback> has risk of negative personal consequences <callback>(not OK)</callback>, they'll feel:</p>
       
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            <emotions>danger</emotions> instead of <emotions>safety</emotions>
        </li>
            <li>
           <emotions>distance</emotions> instead of <emotions>closeness</emotions>
            </li>
        <li><emotions>frustration</emotions> instead of <emotions>delight</emotions> </li>
    </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
        
        <p>Negative outcomes can help us work backwards to understand starting evaluations, and how our actions in context shifted those evaluations. If someone felt <emotions>danger</emotions>, how could that have been reduced? If someone felt <emotions>distance</emotions>, how could other parts of the humor attempt have indicated <emotions>closeness</emotions>? And so on.</p>
        
        <p>Over time, this develops greater intuitive sensitivity in different emotional situations.</p>
