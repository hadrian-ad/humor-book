    <h3 id="23-11">Describing humor attempts II</h3>   

  <p>We can look at another, similar instance&mdash;this time from a memory, not from a romantic comedy:<p>

<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Emma is browsing a forum. There's a thread that asks forum users for strong sexual memories of someone you never had any physical contact with.</narration></p>
         
        <p><narration>She reads one of the most popular ones:</narration></p>
          
           <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Poster:</speaker> I (male) was taking a scuba diving class in my university. There was a stunning redhead with a amazing body. We never spoke in class. Fast forward to the end of the school year. We are diving for 2 days at a lake doing the checkout dives. One day 1 as I am exiting the water she is entering the water and said something to like “hurry up you are holding me up” I have no idea why but my response was “Fuck you” in a playful tone. She smiles and responds “OK”. My mind is blown. Class ends and she said. I’ll see you tomorrow. The next day she did not make it to class because she was involved in a car accident. She had injuries that kept her from diving. So yeah. Never saw her again. It’s been 23 years and I still remember that sexy redhead in the white two piece.
            </p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

<p>This example is similar to the scene with the priest: both women had a similar sentiment <callback>("don't hold me up")</callback>, which was followed by a high-velocity charm attempt. <callback>("Fuck you.")</callback></p> 

<p>As before, we can relate the diving student's comment to the emotional sitution. He wasn't trying to make her laugh for laughter's sake&mdash;he was trying to generate fitted humor. He wanted to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle her complaint</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 

<p>Since these outcomes were his <sem-weak>priority</sem-weak>, it was a charm attempt&mdash;a successful high-velocity charm attempt. </p> 


<p>Her smile showed <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on, and their <sem-weak>mutual</sem-weak> humor <humor-outcome>created (mutual) rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed (mutual) personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>(mutually) symbolized ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>The <term>diving student</term> remembers this high-velocity charm attempt as successful&mdash;which may or may not be how the <term2>woman</term2> remembers it.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

    <p>We don't always have a way of talking or thinking about these moments of humor in our day-to-day life. Even though the hinge of the man's story was the woman's smile, the poster doesn't really have a way to talk or think about it. <callback>("My mind was blown.")</callback></p>


     
     <p>Something like "charm" helps us expand where and how we think about humor.</p>
     

      
   <div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>In this book, "play" is a day-to-day word we can understand as a humor attempt. When we play, we're trying to intentionally shift mistakes and OKs into balance. We can see this where the man in the story says <callback>"fuck you"</callback> in a "playful tone." </p>
                
        <p>The problem is that "play" and "humor attempt" don't indicate priorities&mdash;whether intensity or fittedness. This is where words like charm or comedy can be useful when thinking formally about humor.</p>
   </aside>
    </div> 


   
<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Troubleshooting.</b>     <term>If</term> the diving student's high-velocity charm attempt had been unsuccessful, we could use our components of humor to think about <term2>why</term2> it was unsuccessful. To do so, we review our use of topics, including:</p>
        
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>the relevancy of the active topics</li>
      
        <li>whether the humor outcome being rushed was actually on a relevant topics</li>
      
        <li>how rushing those topics relates  to efficiency and cohesion</li>
    </ul>
      
      <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
       
    <p>We can also review mistakes and OKs. If someone felt a deviation from the expected <callback>(mistake)</callback> had risk of negative personal consequences <callback>(not OK)</callback>, they'll feel:</p>
       
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            <emotions>danger</emotions> instead of <emotions>safety</emotions>
        </li>
            <li>
           <emotions>distance</emotions> instead of <emotions>closeness</emotions>
            </li>
        <li><emotions>frustration</emotions> instead of <emotions>delight</emotions> </li>
    </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
        
        <p>Negative outcomes can help us work backwards to understand starting evaluations, and how our actions in context shifted those evaluations.</p> 
        
        <p>If someone felt <emotions>danger</emotions>, how could that have been reduced? If someone felt <emotions>distance</emotions>, how could other parts of the humor attempt have indicated <emotions>closeness</emotions>? These kind of questions can lead us to a greater understanding of what happened and why.</p>
        
             <div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>Even though "fuck you" generated fitted humor in this specific case, that doesn't mean it was the only thing that would have generated fitted humor. </p> 
        
        <p>We could imagine a laugh, wink, gift, and so on as all potentially being different paths to the same outcome&mdash;since all those things could lead to moments where evaluations were balanced in a way that was experienced as fitted.</p>
