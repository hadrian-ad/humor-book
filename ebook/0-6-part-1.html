    <p>In the first of four parts, we'll establish the foundations of how we'll think and talk about humor. To do so, we'll:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list">
       <li>define how humor is used in this particular book</li>
       <li>make some fundamental observations, including a universal pattern to smiling and laughing</li>
       <li>create a framework for thinking about several qualities of humor, including duration and intensity</li>
       <li>expand how we describe situations and interpersonal relations involving humor</li>
       <li>learn to think coherently about the humor we see in movies and shows</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
<p>Most of us think intuitively about humor, and have never systematically thought about our experiences with it. Beginning to do so can feel unusual, and the initial groundwork can feel strange. See how it goes!</p>
    
<p>This part contains 14 chapters, and takes around 3 - 5 hours to read.</p>
