Emotions aren't something we "feel" 
</h3>

  
<!--
<p>In this book, humor tells <em>are</em> humor. When they happen together, humor tells like <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on <em>are</em> humor. 

<p>Sometimes we think that humor is a "feeling." So we'd <term>first</term> feel humor, and <term2>then</term2> have humor tells like <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>. In this way of thinking, it's a "feeling" of humor that's really the humor.</p>

<p>But this isn't always a useful way of thinking. To see this, we can notice that</p> 

-->

<p>We experience emotions all the time without actually "feeling" anything:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>We might not "feel" nervous, but we wring our hands.</li>
    <li>We might not "feel" angry, but our hand is shaking.</li>
    <li>We might not "feel" anxious, but we’re twirling our hair.</li>
    <li>We might not "feel" bored, but we’re bouncing our leg.</li>
    <li>We might not "feel"  sad, but we want to go to bed earlier and earlier.</li>
    <li>We might not "feel" jealous of our friend, but find ourselves being passive-aggressive toward them.</li>
    <li>We might not "feel" humor, but we’re smiling as we’re watching people out the window.</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>If we’re wringing our hands a lot before something stressful, it doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" nervous&mdash;we're nervous:</p>

<div class="vignette">
  
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Owen is wringing his hands, and gets up to use the restroom half a dozen times.</narration>
    </p>
      
       <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> "Worried about your big date?"</p>
        <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(honestly)</internalaction> <speech>"No! I'm a bit surprised at how calm I feel."</speech></p>
        
    <p><narration>Owen heads out.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*to Zoe*</action> <speech>"He's a wreck."</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(worried)</internalaction> <speech>"He's so nervous."</speech></p>
</blockquote>
    </div>

<p>Above, Owen sincerely thinks he doesn't "feel" nervous&mdash;but Emma and Zoe think he's nervous.</p>

<p>That's because Emma and Zoe know the <term>absence</term> of internal <term>feelings</term> isn't as important as the <term2>presence</term2> of <term2>behavior</term2>.</p>

<p>It's the same for humor. It doesn't really matter if we don't "feel" humor. If we're <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell> while watching something&mdash;we're feeling humor. </p>

<p>That's because a "feeling" of humor isn't essential to there being humor&mdash;it's just one of many possible humor tells, which may or may not be present during humor.</p>

<div class="consider">

<!--<p class="consider">Consider</p>-->
        <p>We can set aside the idea that our emotional states are <em>always</em> supposed to have "internal feelings"&mdash;and instead look at a broader pattern of actions, behavior, decisions, and so on <callback>(emotion tells)</callback> to judge our emotional state.</p> 
        </aside>
    </div>
<!--
<div class="consider">   
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         
<p>We sometimes think of an emotion as a centralized thing <callback>("first one thing happens, than many possible outcomes")</callback>, but the word "humor" is a description of decentralized behavior instead <callback>("many possible things first, then one description")</callback></p>
           
           </div>

    <aside class="box">
        <p><b>Feeling.</b> Sometimes we think emotions are <em>supposed</em> to feel like something, like an ambient sensation throughout our body&mdash;something that conclusively indicates <callback>"this is anger/fear/humor."</callback></p> 
        
        <p>This generally uses a model of emotions we learned as children. Emotions were things that were inside us, and that happened in discrete and obvious notes, like from a piano.</p>
        
        <p>As we grow older, we have a growing ability to reflect on our internal experiences&mdash;even so, we're not always presented with alternative models that keep up with our ability or experiences. This can lead to unsound or incomplete perspectives.</p>
