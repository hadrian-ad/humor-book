<p>Charm<callback> (fitted humor)</callback> is an specific <term>outcome</term>, not a specific <term2>method</term2>. There are many methods to reach the same outcome.</p>

<aside class="consider"><consider>For instance:</consider>
         <p>If people from across the city come to a venue for a concert, people will arrive at the venue by different routes and different methods of travel. What's shared isn't the <term>route</term> or <term>method</term>, but the <term2>destination</term2> <callback>(the venue)</callback>.</p> 
         
         <p>In the same way, when different people prioritize fittedness, they'll generate fitted humor by different approaches and methods. What's shared isn't a single approach or method, but the outcome <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>.</aside>

<p>There's no "one way" to make a charm attempt! Since there are many ways to reach a particular humor outcome,
charm attempts can be abrasive, brusque, conventional, generous, kind, rude, teasing, withholding, and so on. </p>

<p>Even though Emma and Zoe's humor attempts have different tones, they both experience each other’s humor attempt similarly&mdash;as charm.</p>
