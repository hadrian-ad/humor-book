<p>Moments of humor have both intensity and fittedness. Sometimes we give more weight to <term>fittedness</term> <callback>("charm")</callback> and sometimes we give more weight to <term2>intensity</term2> <callback>("comedy")</callback>&mdash;and these priorities shape how we judge humor.</p>

<p>But sometimes we prioritize another measure: <vocab>status</vocab>. When we prioritize status <callback>("promotion")</callback>, we start judging humor as good or bad in  strange ways:</p>

<p>Above, Owen felt humor himself, and he saw Zoe feel humor&mdash;which means the novel had decent intensity, fittedness, or both. It’s not until Owen gives priority to his own ideas about <sem-weak>status</sem-weak> that he decides that it’s “bad” humor.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with prioritizing status. One is that status is often tangential to the experience&mdash;a bit like judging someone’s cooking by how much we like their kitchen decor.</p>

<p>Another problem is that status is often entirely in our own heads&mdash;Owen is probably the only one of his social circle who worries that tolerating or briefly enjoying a romance novel is status-decreasing.</p> 

<p>This means Owen is prioritizing his status for an audience of one. He’s essentially trying to impress himself!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>If we get into a habit of prioritizing personal ideas about status, even when no one cares, we can develop a strange relation to humor.</p> 
    
     
    
    <p>We tend to see people who prioritize status over fittedness or intensity to be dull, excruciating, narrow, self-serving, socially insecure, uncurious, uninteresting, and so on.</p> 

<p>In the same way we feel this about <term>others</term>, others feel this about <term2>us</term2>!</p>
</div>


<p>The point isn’t that Owen needs to read books he doesn’t want to&mdash;the point is that he doesn’t need to have a backlash against himself for simply enjoying paging through a book. And he doesn’t need to look down on Zoe for enjoying what she enjoys.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>If Owen looked down on Zoe, he would be judging <term>her</term> based on <term2>his own</term2> ideas of status&mdash;which doesn’t really accomplish anything.</p>
</div>

<p>Owen doesn’t gain anything by prioritizing status when around Zoe&mdash;but he and Zoe <em>do</em> gain something when he <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> prioritize status. If Owen feels humor when Zoe feels humor, they can grow a mutual humor bush:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(sincerely)</internalaction> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Looks like a fun book!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“It is fun.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Good book?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Shameless.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“The dialogue in this book is outrageous!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Isn’t it?!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Owen grow their mutual humor bush)</notes></p>
</div>


<p>When Owen and Zoe grow a mutual humor bush through mutual humor, they grow their ability to mutually characterize their relationship with mutual humor family words&mdash;like <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>This mutual humor allows Owen to accrue greater respect from the people around him. By <sem-weak>not</sem-weak> prioritizing status, he opens the possibility of this mutual humor.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>Owen gains respect by treating Zoe the way he would want to be treated himself.</p>
    
     <p>Owen wouldn’t want Zoe to feel shame for briefly enjoying something he enjoyed, or for her to feel condescension toward <sem-weak>him</sem-weak> when he  enjoys what he enjoys.<p>
    
    <p>This equal treatment is a foundational condition for mutual humor bushes.</p>
</div>


<p>If Owen doesn’t treat others as equals, and prioritizes his personal ideas of status over everything else, he’ll have to live with an internal censor in his head&mdash;one that’s constantly screening his humor for status, fighting against moments of humor, prompting feelings of anger or guilt, and so on.</p> 

<p>This can pointlessly curtail the range and vividness of his experiences and relationships&mdash;without any benefit.</p>


             </div>
               
                   <div class="chapter-end">
    <p>That's it for this chapter!</p>

<div class="chapter-summary">

<p>Sets of topics will have an amount of humor compared to time. This ratio is their "humor bush." This helps us take a broad view of humor, even over intervals where there's no humor.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>
  Humor bushes pair with humor outcomes to <a href="25-03-the-size-of-humor-bush-lets-us-characterize-relationships.html">characterize a relationship</a>. Whether we say someone <outcome-contrast>always</outcome-contrast> controls the situation or just(<outcome-contrast>sometimes</outcome-contrast> influences the situation depends on the size of humor bush.
   </li>
    
    <li>The amount of humor over time can be <a href="25-05-humor-bushes-have-a-dress-code.html">fitted or unfitted</a>. </li>
    
    <li>Humor bushes sum evaluatory perspectives over time, which means different people will have <a href="25-07-each-person-has-a-humor-bush.html">different humor bushes toward each other</a>.
