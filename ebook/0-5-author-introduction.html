<p>I remember being electrified by a book called <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>. It took my lifelong experiences with sitting and massaged out of them beautiful patterns that were completely obvious&mdash;but that I had completely whiffed on picking up on my own. The second they were pointed out, though, everything clicked into place.</p>
                   
    <p>The pieces were there, but what was missing was some kind of catalytic insight to change my observations from a heap to something alive to the world. Feeling this happen over the course of a single book was like getting touched by a magic wand.</p> 
        
    <p>This book aims to do something similar, but for humor. "Sitting" is a good comparison&mdash;the study of daily life is often first a trick of noticing. We'll see how adding some catalytic insight to our lifetime of experiences with smiling and laughing highlights, re-organizes, and energizes what's been right in front of our noses all along.</p>
    
    
    
    <p>We'll be covering humor in its full breadth: the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p>
    
        <p>By the end, I hope that you walk away with a transformed experience in the world: more depth, more joy, more agency.</p>

    <p>I am a humor teacher. What I do isn't exactly the same thing as teaching people to be "funnier." Instead, I help people  grow their sensitivity of understanding to their own experiences.</p>
    
     <p>I became a philosopher of smiling and laughing a bit like how people become amateur botanists or photographers&mdash;I did lots of fieldwork, notetaking, and reflection.  This book here is the result of all this study.</p>
     
      
        <p>What set it all in motion, though, was stumbling across the monumental (and monumentally strange)  <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> by Warren Shibles in high school. This early intervention meant I never had to backtrack to think about humor&mdash;all my reading, formal studies, and activities in life have been with humor as the foundational concept in mind.</p>
        
<hr>
        
        <p>When you know what to look for, you see a world content with not knowing much about humor. In <book-title>The Librarian's Guide to Homelessness</book-title>&mdash;an otherwise useful, crunchy book&mdash;there's a throwaway line line where the author says (paraphrasing) "by the way, humor is the most important thing of all" and then moves on. Why hide this power, brother?</p>
        
         <p>In an introduction to a book of poetic history, Robert Graves briefly mentions that a sense of humor is important: it's required to not go mad and to cure oneself of heartbreak, before not elaborating and moving on. Does he take credit card, or...?</p> 
         
         <p>In <book-title>Custer Died for Your Sins</book-title>, a collection of essays by an indigenous humorist, the author remarks that "laughter encompasses the limits of the human soul." It's a nice statement&mdash;hard to explore in a tangible way.</p> 
         
         <p>For all these authors, if you pressed them on what, exactly, they meant by "humor," and to articulate why and how it's important&mdash;it's likely there's nothing actually there other than the most basic observation of all: which is that smiling and laughing feels really good, and does a lot.</p>
         
         
         <p>This is in no way a criticism of these authors&mdash;the truth is, vanishingly few people are ready to teach humor in any practical, fleshed-out sort of way. It's even given rise to the myth that humor <sem-weak>can't</sem-weak> be taught. But I've found that describes the <term>speaker</term> more than it describes the <term2>subject</term2>: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback></p> 
        
        <p>I couldn't not notice these things, and be a bit frustrated. I was continually amazed at the surface level of understanding of smiling and laughing all around me. There are good ways of understanding and thinking about humor! Clearly, what was needed was an instructive-oriented monograph on humor. My friends were aghast.</p>

<p>When thinking about "humor" comedy usualy dominates the discussion, which is especially true when we lack a balanced understanding of humor. Often, proverbial- or pseudo-models creep in when we listen to our favorite comedians talk on podcasts. But this book focuses on smiling and laughing&mdash;which makes the picture of humor more complex.</p>
    
    <p>Imagine laughing with a stranger, or with the person you're on a first date with. Then think about <em>not</em> laughing with them. It's a big difference, right?</p>
             
    <p>There is something going on that doesn't have to be called "comedy," and is inextricably related to experiences of connection and belonging, or their inverses, isolation and alienation. In this sense, understanding smiling and laughing helps us understand these things.</p>
    
    <p>This takes on a particularly relevant tone today, as we are living through an alienation and loneliness crisis. The problem is that people can't easily experience belonging or connection. Why is this? Without an understanding of humor, we won't get far. </p>
    
               
    <p>If we're ever going to reknit things together, and heal places and people from the root causes that have hollowed out life in so many parts of the world&mdash;it's going to require large-scale reconstruction and retraining. This can't be abstract, top-down, or jargon-driven. It has to be based on something  that's understood and seen as commonsense by everyone.</p>
    
 <p>As I volunteered, worked, and observed in the context of making connection and belonging more achievable for people, I drew on my decades of independent humor fieldwork and theorizing. What continually struck me was the need almost <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> had for humor education.</p>         
           
<p>Despite the severity of the belonging and connection crisis, and the relation of those things to smiling and laughing, everyone&mdash;from engineers and architects to parents and students&mdash;have little to no ability to think actively about humor. And it wasn't just that complex, integrated skills around humor were off the table: even answering basic questions like <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback> was beyond most people's ability.</p>
    
    <p>A shared science of humor is so absent that we don't even notice that it's not there! But once it's pointed out, it's obvious people struggle to describe experiences of alienation or belonging. One major motivation to this book was to remove descriptive incapability, and enable new ways of thinking about problems, their causes, and their solutions.</p>

<!--
    <p>We've probably all been annoyed at <term>prescriptive</term> moralists, who talk about what we "should" smile and laugh at. This book isn't that&mdash;instead, it's <term2>descriptive</term2> of <em>why</em> we smile and laugh. This descriptive part isn't hard, but it does take a while to fully ingest. But when we do, we'll have all kinds of new tools and abilities.</p>
    
-->
    
    <p>Most of us never had any formal training in "humor," which makes us suspicious of the whole idea that humor can be taught at all. Partly, this rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things. There are supportive <term>art</term> courses <callback>(even though art is <term>personal</term>)</callback>&mdash;and deep places to go through <term2>geometry</term2> <callback>(even though squares are <term2>intuitive</term2> in some ways)</callback>. It would be a poor world without  any art or geometry teaching.</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. Like art or geometry, there's nothing unusual about humor being both profoundly personal and intuitive while <em>also</em> being able to be supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>
     
     
<p>Due to pervasive mythology and double standards around humor, combined with the minimal weight given to humor in formal institutions&mdash;I don't think it's  an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects that's the least taught. The result is widespread illiteracy in humor.</p> 
    
<p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere. It comes as:</p> 
    
  <ul class="close-list">
       <li>  periodic confusion or missed information around smiling or laughing</li>
        
        <li>limited practical skills around connection and understanding</li>
   
              <li>absent parsing or articulation skills around what humor "means" and does in situation</li>
         
          <li>unrecognized sampling biases toward comedy </li>
          
          <li>reliance on circular statements when talking about humor</li>
          
          <li>inefficient, tedious, and confusing circumlocutions from using proxies for humor use of proxies for humor</li>
        
        <li>design choices that struggle to see behavior clearly</li>
         
   
         
         <li>proliferation of incoherent myths around humor</li>
    
          
        </ul>
        
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

     
     <p>There's also an important general point too. We're often told or given the impression that laughter and smiling&mdash;very real things!&mdash;are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account. As is obvious once it's pointed out that: that's nonsense! <callback>(Just imagine someone saying that about crying.)</callback></p>
     
     <p>This forced incoherence&mdash;that the tangible, everyday experience of laughing is also so abstract it's not actually thinkable&mdash;creates a sense of powerlessness. It's a bit like someone telling you that a rose is an unthfahomable metaphor and let's leave it at that. It hurts to empty our gardens that way.</p>
     

      
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people. I've found that people are ready for the stability, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>
   
   <hr>
    
<p>This book is more than a quick summary. Instead, I want you to actually learn to think with and use a particular system of humor. (As you probably suspect, there is no "one" way to talk about humor&mdash;this is just one way I find particularly useful and beautiful.) To that end, this book is arranged like a course. Since the chapters are cumulative and build on each other, it's best to read this book straight through, without skipping around.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn a productive theory of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic, incommensurate, or equivicative zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p>

    <aside class="consider">
  
        <p>I want to clarify what this book is not. It's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>That means this isn't a book about psychology, neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, commercialization, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research and observational philosophy. It's about what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>
        
        <p>The general idea here is that, before starting any botany or environmental engineering courses, it's worth taking a walk in the woods and seeing what we see.</p>
    </aside>
</div>
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. By the end of this book, I hope you'll come to see, as I do, that the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
