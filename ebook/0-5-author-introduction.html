    <p>One of my favorite books is called <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>. It took something I had a lot of  experience with <callback>(sitting)</callback>&mdash;and then <sem-weak>bam</sem-weak> hit me with a lightning bolt. It was like a magic wand: a touch of catalytic insight, and everything was different.</p> 
        
    <p>This book aims to do something similar, but for humor. We've all been smiling (and reacting to smiles) since before we could speak. We have a literal lifetime of raw observations&mdash;but what's sometimes missing, including in ways we don't always notice is absent,  is some catalytic insight to organize our observations.</p> 
    
    <p>That's what we'll be doing here. I'll be pointing out things about smiling and laughing that won't be <sem-weak>new</sem-weak> to you exactly, but might still be surprising. These are things that, once seen, can't be unseen. I want this new vision to transform your experience in the world.</p> 
    
    <p>We'll be covering humor in its full breadth: the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p>

    <p>I am a humor teacher. What I do isn't exactly the same thing as teaching people to be "funnier." Instead, I guide people through systems that grow sensitivity to their own lifelong experiences with humor.</p>
    
    
     <p>While I studied environmental history and was trained as a professional writer, my interest has always been in reknitting people together. A terrible loneliness epidemic has hollowed out life in North America and elsewhere, and I see clearly the large-scale social reconstruction and retraining needed to heal places and people from this.</p>
    
            <p>As I volunteered, worked, and observed in this context, I drew on my decades of independent humor fieldwork and theorizing&mdash;and what continually struck me was the need almost <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> had for humor education. It wasn't just that complex, integrated skills around humor were off the table. Even  answering basic questions like <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback> was beyond most people's ability.</p>
    
    
    <p>This book aims to remove a root obstacle to so many things: a humor science so absent that it's hard to even <sem-weak>describe</sem-weak> experiences of alienation or belonging, let alone instigate changes.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Most of us never had any formal training in "humor," which makes us suspicious of the whole idea that humor can be taught at all. Partly, this rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things. There are supportive <term>art</term> courses <callback>(even though art is <term>personal</term>)</callback>&mdash;and deep places to go through <term2>geometry</term2> <callback>(even though squares are <term2>intuitive</term2> in some ways)</callback>. It would be a poor world without  any art or geometry teaching.</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. Like art or geometry, there's nothing unusual about humor being both profoundly personal and intuitive while <em>also</em> able to be supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>
     
     
<p>Due to pervasive mythology and double standards around humor, combined with the low weight given to humor in formal institutions&mdash;I don't think it's  an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects that's the least taught. The result is widespread illiteracy in humor.</p> 
    
<p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere. It comes as:</p> 
    
  <ul class="close-list">
       <li>  periodic confusion or missed information</li>
        
        <li>a loss of practical skills around connection and understanding</li>
        
        <li>poor design choices that struggle to see people clearly</li>
          
        </ul>
        
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
<p>As is obvious when it's pointed out, we're often told that very real things&mdash;laughter, smiling&mdash;are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account. <callback>(Imagine someone said that about crying!)</callback> It's a forced incoherency that creates a sense of powerlessness.</p> 
      
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people. I've found that people are ready for the stability, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>

<p>This book is more than a quick summary. Instead, I want you to actually learn to think and use a particular system of humor. To that end, this book is arranged like a course. Since the chapters are cumulative and build on each other, it's best to read this book straight through, without skipping around.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn a productive theory of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic, incommensurate, or equivative zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p>

        <p>I want to clarify a few things that this book is not. First, it's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>Second, this isn't a book about neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, commercialization, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research. It's about what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>

 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. By the end of this book, I hope you'll come to see, as I do, that the study of humor is part of the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
