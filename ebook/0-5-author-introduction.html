                 </div>
               
    
    
<p>I remember being floored by a book called <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>.  I had been sitting my entire life, and yet my observations had somehow been in limbo. So I had the strange experience of self-evident things being pointed out and becoming self-evident in real time.</p>
                   
    <p>I had been missing some catalytic insight. Gaining it felt a bit like getting touched by a magic want: everything transformed from a heap into an organized structure. It made the world look different.</p> 
        
    <p>This book aims to do something similar, but for humor. We all have a lifetime of experiences and raw observations with smiling and laughing.  We'll see how adding some catalytic insight highlights and re-organizes what's been right in front of our noses all along.</p> 
    
    
    <p>We'll be covering humor in its full breadth: the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p>
    
        <p>By the end, I hope that you walk away with a transformed experience in the world: more depth, more joy, more agency.</p> 
   
    
    <hr>

    <p>I am a humor teacher. What I do isn't exactly the same thing as teaching people to be "funnier." Instead, I guide people through systems that grow their sensitivity of understanding to their own experiences.</p>
    
     <p>I became a philosopher of smiling and laughing a bit like how people become amateur botanists or photographers&mdash;I did lots of fieldwork, notetaking, and reflection. This book here is entirely the result of my independent study of humor.</p>
     
      
        <p>What set it all in motion, though, was stumbling across the monumental (and monumentally strange)  <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> by Warren Shibles in high school. This early intervention meant I never had to backtrack to think about humor&mdash;all my reading, formal studies, and activities in life have been with humor as the foundational concept in mind.</p>
        
        <p>When you know what to look for, you see a world content with not knowing much about humor. In <book-title>The Librarian's Guide to Homelessness</book-title>&mdash;an otherwise crunchy, useful book&mdash;there's a throwaway line line where the author says (paraphrasing) "by the way, humor is the most important thing of all" and then moves on.</p>
        
         <p>In an introduction to a book of poetic history, Robert Graves briefly mentions that a sense of humor is important: it's required to not go mad and to cure oneself of heartbreak, before not elaborating and moving on. Does he take credit card, or...?</p> 
         
         <p>In <book-title>Custer Died for Your Sins</book-title>, a collection of essays by an indigenous humorist, the author remarks that "laughter encompasses the limits of the human soul." It's a nice statement&mdash;not exactly tangible.</p> 
         
         <p>For all these authors, if you pressed them on what, exactly, they meant by "humor"&mdash;and to articulate why and how it's important&mdash;it's likely there's nothing actually there other than the most basic observation of all: which is that smiling and laughing feels really good, and does a lot.</p>
         
         
         <p>This is in no way a criticism of these authors&mdash;the truth is, vanishingly few people are ready to teach humor in any practical, fleshed-out sort of way. It's even given rise to the myth that humor <sem-weak>can't</sem-weak> be taught. But I've found that describes the speaker more than the subject: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback></p> 
        
        <p>I couldn't not notice these sorts of thing. I was a high schooler who didn't realize it wasn't normal to walk around with a few competing thoeries of humor in my head. And as life passed, I was continually amazed at the surface level understanding of humor all around me&mdash;humor was treated as simultaneously the best thing and also the blank part of the map.</p>
        
        <p>Eventually&mdash;after sharing my perspective on humor with others, and taking hundreds and hundreds of pages of notes&mdash;I decided to write a monograph on the subject.</p>
         
        
<hr>

   

<p>At the outset, I wanted to bring up  the alienation and loneliness crisis. I prefer to focus on the problem, not the outcome: people can't easily experience belonging and connection. Reknitting things together has been the focus of my intellectual and career practices over the years</p>

               
    <p>If we're ever going to begin healing places and people from the root causes hollowing out life in so many parts of the world, it's going to require large-scale reconstruction and retraining. This can't be top-down: it has to be based on something  that's understood  by everyone.</p>
    
<p>As I volunteered, worked, and observed in this context, I drew on my decades of independent humor fieldwork and theorizing. What continually struck me was the need almost <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> had for humor education.</p> 
          
          <p>Think about laughing with a stranger, or the person you're on a date with. Then think about <sem-weak>not</sem-weak> laughing with them. It's a big difference, right? We can take it even further too, like thinking about laughing at work, generally, and then thinking about <sem-weak>never</sem-weak> laughing at work, ever. We all know humor is related to experiences of connection and belonging.</p>
          
          
           
           
           <p>Despite the severity of the belonging and connection crisis, and the relation of those things to humor, everyone&mdash;from engineers and architects to parents and students&mdash;have little to no ability to think actively about humor. And it wasn't just that complex, integrated skills around humor were off the table&mdash;even answering basic questions like <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback> was beyond most people's ability.</p>
    
    <p>A shared science of humor is so absent that we don't even notice that it's not there. One result was that people struggle to even describe experiences of alienation or belonging. One major motivation to this book was to remove descriptive incapability as an obstacle.</p>
    

    <hr>
    
<!--
    <p>We've probably all been annoyed at <term>prescriptive</term> moralists, who talk about what we "should" smile and laugh at. This book isn't that&mdash;instead, it's <term2>descriptive</term2> of <em>why</em> we smile and laugh. This descriptive part isn't hard, but it does take a while to fully ingest. But when we do, we'll have all kinds of new tools and abilities.</p>
    
-->
    
    <p>Most of us never had any formal training in "humor," which makes us suspicious of the whole idea that humor can be taught at all. Partly, this rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things. There are supportive <term>art</term> courses <callback>(even though art is <term>personal</term>)</callback>&mdash;and deep places to go through <term2>geometry</term2> <callback>(even though squares are <term2>intuitive</term2> in some ways)</callback>. It would be a poor world without  any art or geometry teaching.</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. Like art or geometry, there's nothing unusual about humor being both profoundly personal and intuitive while <em>also</em> being able to be supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>
     
     
<p>Due to pervasive mythology and double standards around humor, combined with the minimal weight given to humor in formal institutions&mdash;I don't think it's  an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects that's the least taught. The result is widespread illiteracy in humor.</p> 
    
<p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere. It comes as:</p> 
    
  <ul class="close-list">
       <li>  periodic confusion or missed information around smiling or laughing</li>
        
        <li>limited practical skills around connection and understanding</li>
   
              <li>absent parsing or articulation skills around what humor "means" and does in situation</li>
         
          <li>Unrecognized sampling biases toward comedy </li>
          
          <li>reliance on circular statements when talking about humor</li>
          
          <li>inefficient use of proxies for humor, leading to tedious or confusing circumlocution</li>
        
        <li>design choices that struggle to see behavior clearly</li>
         
   
         
         <li>proliferation of incoherent myths or ideas around humor</li>
    
          
        </ul>
        
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

     
     <p>There's also an important general point too. We're often told or given the impression that laughter and smiling&mdash;very real things&mdash;are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account. As is obvious once it's pointed out that&mdash;this is nonsense! <callback>(Just imagine someone saying that about crying.)</callback></p>
     
     <p>This forced incoherence&mdash;that the tangible, everyday experience of laughing is also so abstract it's not actually thinkable&mdash;creates a sense of powerlessness and flawed foundations in our understanding of the world.</p> 
      
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people. I've found that people are ready for the stability, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>
   
   <hr>
    
<p>This book is more than a quick summary. Instead, I want you to actually learn to think with and use a particular system of humor. To that end, this book is arranged like a course. Since the chapters are cumulative and build on each other, it's best to read this book straight through, without skipping around.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn a productive theory of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic, incommensurate, or equivicative zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p>

        <p>I want to clarify what this book is not. It's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>That means this isn't a book about psychology, neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, commercialization, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research and observational philosophy. It's about what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>
    </aside>
</div>
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. By the end of this book, I hope you'll come to see, as I do, that the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
