<p>For background, I am a normal sitter. So when I started a book called <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>, I thought&mdash;surely, I am safe from unexpected, and certainly revolutionary, insight. Nope! As I learned again, just because something is in front of my nose doesn't mean its obvious.</p>
                
<p>The book showed me patterns and perspectives about sitting that I had completely missed. And it did this by simply giving me a guided tour of my own observations. As everything started to click into place, it was like a magic wand was waved&mdash;hidden things became suddenly self-evident. It was like a new world was created.</p> 
                 
<p>I aim to do something similar for you here, but for humor. Like everyone, you've been laughing and smiling since before you could talk&mdash;since before you had teeth. This lifetime of experience will be the raw materials we'll use in this book to understand everything better.</p> 
   
 <p>Like with sitting and other things of day-to-day life, learning about humor is first and foremost a trick of noticing. We have a heap of observations: some catalytic insight will set off a chain reaction of understanding, helping us make sense of what's been in front of us all along.</p>
    
<p>
   
   We'll be covering humor in its full breadth: the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p>
    
        <p>By the end, I hope that you walk away energized and transformed: the world will have more depth, more joy, more agency.</p> 
   
    
    
    <h5>A world content to not know humor</h5>

    <p>I am a humor teacher. That doesn't mean I directly teach people to be "funnier." Instead, I guide people through systems of observation&mdash;with the goal of growing their sensititivity of understanding to their own experiences. That means you'll become wiser about smiling and laughing on the strength of your own observations.</p>
        
    <p>We need humor teachers! Once you know what to look for, there's a strange state of affairs: a world content with not knowing much about humor.</p>
        

   <ul class="close-list">
             <li>In <book-title>The Librarian's Guide to Homelessness</book-title>&mdash;an otherwise crunchy, useful book&mdash;there's a throwaway line line where the author says (paraphrasing,  but not by much) <callback>"by the way, humor is the most important thing of all"</callback> and then moves on. Why hide this power, brother?</li>
            
             <li>In an introduction to a book of poetic history, Robert Graves briefly mentions that a sense of humor is required to not go mad and to cure oneself of heartbreak&mdash;before not elaborating and moving on. Does he take credit card, or...?</li> 
             
             <li>
                 In <book-title>Custer Died for Your Sins</book-title>, a collection of essays by an indigenous humorist, the author remarks that <callback>"laughter encompasses the limits of the human soul."</callback> It's a nice enough statement&mdash;but does it mean much?</li></ul>
         
         <p>For all these authors, if you pressed them on what, exactly, they meant by "humor," and to articulate why and how it's important&mdash;it's likely there's nothing actually there, other than the most basic observation of all, which is that smiling and laughing feels really good, and does a lot.</p>
         
         <p>This is in no way a criticism of these specific authors. We've all probably exalted humor and then hurried along at one point or another. The truth is that vanishingly few people are ready to explicate humor in any practical, fleshed-out sort of way.</p> 
         
         
         <p>It gives rise to a number of silly, interlinked myths, which bother me to no end&mdash;including the persistent one that humor <sem-weak>can't</sem-weak> be taught. That, of course,  describes the <term>speaker</term> more than it describes the <term2>subject</term2>: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback> </p> 
        
        <p>Since freshman year of high school, when I first started pondering all this, I couldn't not notice this: that what we sometimes currently call "humor" was like a blank spot on the map. And it became increasingly strange that it was common to meet people with intuitive excellence in smiling and laughing&mdash;but very rare to find people who could articulate anything about it beyond a surface level.</p> 
        
        <p>It doesn't have to be this way! And maybe more importantly, it <sem-weak>shouldn't</sem-weak> be that way. We can instead simply treat humor like anything else, and learn about it.</p>
        
        <h5>You can teach and learn humor</h5>
    
    
    <p>Most of us never had any formal training in "humor," which makes us suspicious of the whole idea that humor can be taught at all. Partly, this rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things. There are supportive <term>art</term> courses <callback>(even though art is <term>personal</term>)</callback>&mdash;and deep places to go through <term2>geometry</term2> <callback>(even though squares are <term2>intuitive</term2> in some ways)</callback>. It would be a poor world if there were no art or geometry teaching, on the reasoning that it was useless or impossible!</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. Like art or geometry, there's nothing unusual about humor being both profoundly personal and intuitive&mdash;while <em>also</em> being able to be supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>
        

<h5>A world without belonging</h5>

<p>Imagine trying to solve world hunger, but a wing of the world hunger committee keeps talking about pizzarias. Yes, we all like pizza, but is that really the overarching theme of what we're doing?</p>   
 
<p>I am, of course, talking about comedy. This book will be inclusive to comedy, but will also be much, much broader&mdash;the same way eating is inclusive to pizza, but much broader.</p>

<p>My roots aren't in comedy, but in community-building&mdash;and these roots provide the nutrients that have shaped this book. In my work, I meet thousands of people a year, and one of my jobs is to produce smiles and laughs. I support those smiles and laughs through invitations, introductions, re-arranging space, planning, and so on.</p>

<p>When I facilitate a community dance, I am surrounded by smiles and laughs. It's similar to, but often more sustained than, the smiling and laughing produced at a comedy club. My goal is to explain all smiles and laughs at the same time.</p>
 
<p>While most people haven't been to a comedy club, most people have been lonely. We live in a crisis of alienation and loneliness, which you can see by looking out of almost any window: physical infrastructure devoid of people. Talk to just about anyone, and they'll tell you about social lives as lifeless as parking lots. Grim as it is to say, things have been hollowed out or plucked apart at the seams.</p> 
 
 <p>If we're going to heal places and people from this crisis, we're going to need large-scale reconstruction and retraining. But this can't be done through jargon and astract thinking. 
 Instead, it has to be based on something that's tangible and understood by everyone, and seen as common sense. Everyone will have to join in.</p>
 
 <p>So what does this all have to do with smiling and laughing? Well, everything, really&mdash;just imagine you're in a room with a stranger and you both share a laugh. (Then imagine you <em>don't</em> share a laugh or smile.) You can probably feel the tangible hinge&mdash;between connection and not connection&mdash;was that humor.</p>
 
 <p>This gets generalized to our ability to smile and laugh in the world&mdash;an issue that is both individual <callback>(if we do nothing ourselves we won't laugh)</callback> and systemic <callback>(if others don't support us we'll have less opportunities to laugh)</callback>. That's why engineers, landscapers, architects, event planners, teachers, and <em>everyone</em> need training in humor.</p>

 <p>In my community-building work, I constantly draw on my decades of independent humor fieldwork and theorizing. And I am continually struck by the need almost <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> has for humor education. It's not just that complex, integrated skills around humor are off the table&mdash;it's that even answering basic questions like <callback>"why did they smile?"</callback> is beyond most people's ability.</p>   
 
 <p>A shared humor science is so absent that we don't always notice it's not there! But once it's pointed out, it's obvious that it's hard for people to even describe experiences of alienation-belonging and loneliness-connection&mdash;let alone make effective interventions.</p>

             <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            
            <p>I'm sure you know the story of the Three Blind Men, who come across an elephant, but can't generalize from one touch what it is they've encountered: 
             </p>
             
              <ul class="close-list">
              <li>one man touches a tail and declares the elephant is a rope</li>
               <li>another man touches a leg and declares the elephant is a tree trunk</li>
               <li>another touches an ear and says the elephant is the drape</li>
             </ul>
            
        <p>We do this with humor all the time! We all notice that laughing sometimes seems to relate to truth, and sometimes to lies&mdash;sometimes to kindness, and sometimes to cruelty&mdash;sometimes to insight, and sometimes to drivel. What kind of elephant is this?</p>

<h5>Ending humor illiteracy, together.</h5>

<p>Due to pervasive mythology and double standards around humor, combined with the minimal weight given to humor in formal institutions&mdash;I don't think it's  an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects that's the least taught. The result is widespread illiteracy in humor.</p> 
    
<p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere:</p> 
   
 
      <ul class="close-list">
    <li><b>We get confused.</b> We encounter smiling or laughing that perplexes us. Sometimes humor can be troubling or upsetting, which can be compounded by our confusion.</li>
    
    <li><b>Our descriptive ability is insufficient.</b> Our articulation skills about what humor "means" or "does" can feel underdevoleped. We often simply don't talk about it, or we try but trail off&mdash;or offer an incomplete statement.</li> 
     
     <li><b>Our practical framework is limited.</b> We often don't have a way of evaluating or making improvements to outcomes around smiling or laughing. Usually, we rely exclusively on intuitive or ad hoc processes.</li>

           <li><b>Our parsing skills are absent.</b> We can't pick apart why we are smiling or laughing, and can't convey that to others.</li>
      
       <li><b>We have sampling biases.</b> When we think of "humor" we think of comedy shows, even though the majority of smiling and laughing in our lives happens away from those things. </li>
       
       <li><b>We rely on circular statements.</b> Definitions of humor and related words are notoriously circular. <callback>("Why is it funny? Because I laughed. Why did I laugh? Because it's funny.")</callback> This often happens when genre terms (descriptions) are substituted for mechanisms. <callback>("Why is it a farce? Because I laughed. Why did I laugh? Because it's a farce.")</callback></li>
             
     <li><b>We struggle to make concious design choices.</b> Everything we do has potential downstream impacts on smiling or laughing, but it can be hard to think about this. If someone asks us to make a design choice to maximize smiling or laughing, we may not feel this framing is justifiable or well-understood.</li>
      


      <li><b>We accept myths around humor.</b> We tend to hold ideas about humor that fall apart when given even cursury examination&mdash;like that some people are born funny, and that some people aren't.</li>
 
       
     </ul>
     
  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>     
    
    <p>Humor illiteracy is a problem! Luckily, it's not just easy to fix&mdash;it's fun to fix. Learning about humor feels good, and has positive ramifications everywhere in our lives.</p>
    
<h5>Humor is not more abstract than anything else: a note on power</h5>
    

     
       <p>I want to emphasize an important general point around humor and abstraction. Smiling and laughing are very real things! Physical things! They  exist like rocks and trees! They're events, like rain or budding! Even so, we're often told or given the impression that laughter and smiling are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account.</p> 
     
     <p>As is obvious as soon as it's pointed out: that's nonsense! Just imagine someone saying that <sem-weak>crying</sem-weak> was too abstract to be taken into account. </p>
          
     <p>This forced incoherence&mdash;that the tangible, everyday experience of laughing is also so abstract it's not actually thinkable&mdash;creates a sense of powerlessness. It's a bit like someone telling you that a rose is an unthfahomable metaphor and let's leave it at that. It hurts to empty our gardens that way.</p>
     

      
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people&mdash;It's a way of filling our gardens. I've found that people are ready for the stability, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>
   

   
<h5>The journey ahead</h5>
    
<p>This book is more than a quick summary. Instead, I want you to actually learn to think with and use a particular system of humor. (As you probably suspect, there is no "one" way to talk about humor&mdash;this is just one way I find particularly useful and beautiful.)</p> 
  
  <p>To that end, this book is arranged like a course. The chapters are cumulative and build on each other&mdash;and so it's best to read this book straight through, without skipping around.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn a productive theory of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic, incommensurate, or equivicating zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
  
        <p>I want to clarify what this book is not. It's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>That means this isn't a book about psychology, neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, commercialization, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research and observational philosophy. It's about what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>
        
    </aside>
</div>
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. By the end of this book, I hope you'll be a philosopher of smiling and laughing, just like you were always meant to be&mdash;and come to see, as I do, that the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
