<p>When I started a book called <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>, I thought I would be safe from revolutionary insight. Nope! Instead, I was struck by lightning&mdash;there were patterns and perspectives I had completely missed. A new world of self-evident vision emerged.</p>
                 
                 <p>I remember being electrified by a book called <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>. If there was one subject I thought I was safe from unexpected revolutionary insight, it was sitting. Nope! Instead, I was caught flatfooted and struck by lightning&mdash;as patterns and perspectives were pointed out, a new world of self-evident things emerged.</p> 
                  
<p>How had I missed things that had been in front of my nose the whole time? As things clicked into place, I marveled that a simple guided tour of my own observations could yield so much.</p>
                   

        
    <p>I aim to do something similar for you here, but for humor. Like sitting or other things of daily life, learning about humor is first and foremost a trick of noticing. We already have a lifetime of experiences with smiling and laughing: by adding some catalytic insight, we'll get the chain reaction going to make sense of what's been in front of our noses all along.</p>
    
    
    <p>We'll be covering humor in its full breadth: the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p>
    
        <p>By the end, I hope that you walk away with a transformed, energized experience in the world: more depth, more joy, more agency.</p> 
   
    
    
    <h5>A world content to not know humor</h5>

    <p>I am a humor teacher. I don't directly teach people to be "funnier." Instead,  I guide people through systems of observations that help them grow their sensitivity of understanding to their own experiences. We'll become wiser about smiling and laughing by noticing what we know as well as what we don't know&mdash;and seeing where those things take us.</p>
    
<!--        <p>What set it all in motion, though, was stumbling across the monumental (and monumentally strange)  <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> by Warren Shibles in high school. This early intervention meant I never had to backtrack to think about humor&mdash;all my reading, formal studies, and activities in life have been with humor as the foundational concept in mind.</p>-->
        
        
        <p>Teachers of humor are needed. After all, once you know what to look for, you see a world content with not knowing much about humor. In <book-title>The Librarian's Guide to Homelessness</book-title>&mdash;an otherwise crunchy, useful book&mdash;there's a throwaway line line where the author says (to paraphrase,  but not by much) <callback>"by the way, humor is the most important thing of all"</callback> and then moves on. Why hide this power, brother?</p>
        
         <p>In an introduction to a book of poetic history, Robert Graves briefly mentions that a sense of humor is required to not go mad and to cure oneself of heartbreak&mdash;before not elaborating and moving on. Does he take credit card, or...?</p> 
         
         <p>In <book-title>Custer Died for Your Sins</book-title>, a collection of essays by an indigenous humorist, the author remarks that <callback>"laughter encompasses the limits of the human soul."</callback> It's a nice statement&mdash;but does it mean much?</p> 
         
         <p>For all these authors, if you pressed them on what, exactly, they meant by "humor," and to articulate why and how it's important&mdash;it's likely there's nothing actually there, other than the most basic observation of all, which is that smiling and laughing feels really good, and does a lot.</p>
         
         
         <p>This is in no way a criticism of these authors&mdash;this is the level most of us are at, and the truth is that vanishingly few people are ready to explicate humor in any practical, fleshed-out sort of way. It gives rise to a number of silly, interlinked myths, including the persistent one that humor <sem-weak>can't</sem-weak> be taught. That, of course,  describes the <term>speaker</term> more than it describes the <term2>subject</term2>: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback> </p> 
        
        <p>From freshman year of high school on, after I first came across the monumental (and monumentally weird) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;I couldn't not notice that, for most people, this was a blank spot in the map. And it became increasingly strange that it was easy to meet people with intuitive excellence in smiling and laughing, but very rare to find people who could articulate anything about it beyond a surface level.</p> 
        
        <p>It doesn't have to be this way! That's where this book comes in: a concrete, instruction-oriented book on humor&mdash;guiding people through it in the way I had come to see and teach it to others.</p> 
     

<h5>A world without belonging</h5>

<p>I've thought a lot about the loneliness crisis, which has hollowed out life in so many places. To heal places and people from the root causes, we're going to need large-scale reconstruction and retraining&mdash;but this can't be done through jargon and astract, top-down thinking. Instead, it has to be based on something that's understood by everyone and seen as commonsense, and can give guidance for anything, whether large or small.</p>
   
<p>My life, like those of my peers, has happened in the context of the loneliness crisis. I work in fields that try to reknit things togother&mdash;and I always draw on my decades of independent humor fieldwork and theorizing. I was continually struck by the need almost <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> had for humor education.</p> 
   
<p>The problem on the surface is easy to describe: people can't easily experience belonging or connection. But the problem in depth is harder to describe. </p>
    
<p>Imagine you're on a first date or sitting next to a stranger&mdash;and imagine you both laugh. Then imagine you both <em>don't</em> laugh. You can repeat this wherever: students in college classes; you alone in your apartment; coworkers in a workplace; people at an intercity bus terminal.</p> 
                      
<p>We all can feel there's something inextricably linked between experiences of connection and belonging and smiling and laughing! And so we won't really understand or be able to make interventions around loneliness / connection and alienation / belonging without understanding humor.</p>
                      
<p>Unfortunately, I've found that complex, integrated skills around humor weren't just off the table for most people: even answering basic questions like <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback> was beyond most people's ability.</p>
    
    <p>We don't always notice that this humor science is absent&mdash;but once it's pointed out, it's obvious that people struggle to describe experiences of laughing, let alone experiences of alienation or belonging.</p> 

                       
 <p>This is an all-hands on deck issue. Sure, the people actually on the date need to have an understanding of smiling and laughing. And so this book is for them. But you know who also should have an understanding of smiling and laughing? The interior designers, landscapers, and engineers too&mdash;who make decisions about the restaurant, park, and streets that the date happens on. This book is also for them.</p> 
   
    
    <p>I want you to gain descriptive capacity through this book: a way of talking and thinking about problems, causes, and solutions&mdash;around smiling and laughing as well as their absence.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
      <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>I'm sure you know the story of the Three Blind Men, who come across an elephant but can't catch the full picture from the one piece they each touch: 
     </p>
     
  <ul class="close-list">
            <li>one man touches a tail and declares the elephant is a rope</li>
         <li>another man touches a leg and declares the elephant is a tree trunk</li>
         <li>another touches an ear and says the elephant is the drape.</li>
     </ul>
      
    <p>We do this with humor! At different times, we all notice that humor seems to conflict: humor is sometimes related to truth, and sometimes to lies&mdash;sometimes to kindness, and sometimes to cruelty&mdash;sometimes to insight, and sometimes to drivel. What kind of elephant is this?</p> 
    
    <p>We'll be looking for the big picture, where we can make sense of why we think this about humor, and how it can all elegantly fit together.</p> 
        
    </div>
    
<h5>You can teach and learn humor</h5>
    
<!--
    <p>We've probably all been annoyed at <term>prescriptive</term> moralists, who talk about what we "should" smile and laugh at. This book isn't that&mdash;instead, it's <term2>descriptive</term2> of <em>why</em> we smile and laugh. This descriptive part isn't hard, but it does take a while to fully ingest. But when we do, we'll have all kinds of new tools and abilities.</p>
    
-->
    
    <p>Most of us never had any formal training in "humor," which makes us suspicious of the whole idea that humor can be taught at all. Partly, this rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things. There are supportive <term>art</term> courses <callback>(even though art is <term>personal</term>)</callback>&mdash;and deep places to go through <term2>geometry</term2> <callback>(even though squares are <term2>intuitive</term2> in some ways)</callback>. It would be a poor world without  any art or geometry teaching.</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. Like art or geometry, there's nothing unusual about humor being both profoundly personal and intuitive while <em>also</em> being able to be supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>
     
     
<p>Due to pervasive mythology and double standards around humor, combined with the minimal weight given to humor in formal institutions&mdash;I don't think it's  an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects that's the least taught. The result is widespread illiteracy in humor.</p> 
    
<p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere:</p> 
   
 
      <ul class="close-list">
    <li><b>We get confused.</b> We encounter smiling or laughing that perplexes us. Sometimes it can be troubling or upsetting.</li>
    
    <li><b>Meaning feels speculative.</b> Our articulation skills about what humor "means" or "does" feels underdevoleped, and we often trail off, offer an incomplete statement, or simply don't talk about it.</li> 
     
     <li><b>Our practical skills are limited</b>. We can't reliably make strangers smile, reduce tension, or make people feel comfortable&mdash;or, more specifically, don't have a framework for how this happens or how we could evaluate or improve.</li>

           <li><b>Our parsing skills are missing.</b> We can't pick apart why we are smiling, especially in a way that's conveyable to others.</li>
      
       <li><b>We have sampling biases.</b> When we think of "humor" we think of comedy shows, even though the majority of smiling and laughing in our lives happens away from those things. </li>
       
       <li><b>We rely on circular statements.</b> Definitions of humor and related words are notoriously circular. <callback>("Why is it funny? Because I laughed. Why did I laugh? Because it's funny.")</callback> Circular statements are technically perfect and functionally useless.</li>
       
       <li><b>We rely on circumlocutions.</b> We often use proxy concepts for humor, which includes  using genre terms as if they're explanatory mechanisms, like comedy, farce, roast, wit, etc. <callback>("We laughed because it's a farce.")</callback></li>
       
     <li><b>We struggle to make design choices.</b> If someone says pick a table for a corner that supports smiling and laughing, we may not feel competent to make that choice&mdash;or even exactly understand what the question means.</li>
      

      
      <li><b>We accept myths around humor.</b> We tend to have unexamined ideas about humor, like that some people are born funny, and that some people aren't.</li>
 
       
     </ul>
     
  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>     
    
    <p>Humor illiteracy is a problem! Luckily, it's easy to get a handle on everything&mdash;something with positive ramifications everywhere in our lives.</p>
    
<h5>Humor is not abstract</h5>
    
    <p>We saw one author say that humor encompasses the human soul. Most of us like and agree with statements like these&mdash;however, these statements are so abstract as to be powerless. (Try giving this to an engineer as a design principle, or using it to a provost to try to enact change at a university.)</p>
     
       <p>I want to emphasize an important general point around humor and abstraction. Smiling and laughing are very real things! Physical things! They  exist like rocks and trees! Even so, we're often told or given the impression that laughter and smiling are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account.</p> 
     
     <p>As is obvious as soon as it's pointed out this way: that's nonsense! <callback>(Just imagine someone saying that crying was too abstract to be taken into account.)</callback></p>
          
     <p>This forced incoherence&mdash;that the tangible, everyday experience of laughing is also so abstract it's not actually thinkable&mdash;creates a sense of powerlessness. It's a bit like someone telling you that a rose is an unthfahomable metaphor and let's leave it at that. It hurts to empty our gardens that way.</p>
     

      
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people&mdash;It's a way of filling our gardens. I've found that people are ready for the stability, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>
   

   
<h5>The journey ahead</h5>
    
<p>This book is more than a quick summary. Instead, I want you to actually learn to think with and use a particular system of humor. (As you probably suspect, there is no "one" way to talk about humor&mdash;this is just one way I find particularly useful and beautiful.)</p> 
  
  <p>To that end, this book is arranged like a course. Since the chapters are cumulative and build on each other, it's best to read this book straight through, without skipping around.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn a productive theory of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic, incommensurate, or equivicating zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
  
        <p>I want to clarify what this book is not. It's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>That means this isn't a book about psychology, neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, commercialization, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research and observational philosophy. It's about what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>
        
    </aside>
</div>
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. By the end of this book, I hope you'll be a philosopher of smiling and laughing, like you were meant to be&mdash;and come to see, as I do, that the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
