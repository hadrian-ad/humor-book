    <p>I had an unforgettable experience reading a book called <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>. Like you, I had spent a lifetime sitting&mdash;despite this, <sem-weak>bam!</sem-weak> the book hit me like a lightning bolt.</p>
       
    <p>It was like a magic wand: a touch of catalytic insight, and everything looked different. Things I had been seeing but not <sem-weak>seeing</sem-weak> became obvious. The world took on more depth.</p> 
        
    <p>This book aims to do something similar, but for humor. Since we've all been smiling since before we could speak, we all have a literal lifetime of raw observations to work with. But what's sometimes missing, including in ways we don't always notice, is some catalytic insight to organize our observations.</p> 
    
    <p>That's what we'll be doing here. I'll be pointing out things about smiling and laughing that won't be <sem-weak>new</sem-weak> to you exactly, but might still be surprising. These are things that, once seen, can't be unseen. I want this new vision to transform your experience in the world&mdash;more depth, more joy, more agency.</p> 
    
    <p>We'll be covering humor in its full breadth: the smiles we make while sad and angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p>

    <p>I am a humor teacher. What I do isn't exactly the same thing as teaching people to be "funnier." Instead, I guide people through systems that grow their sensitivity to their own lifelong experiences with humor.</p>
    
     <p>The story of how I became a philosopher of smiling and laughing isn't particularly interesting&mdash;it's something I did lots of fieldwork and notetaking for, a bit like how people become amateur botanists or photographers.</p> 
     
     <p>What set everything in motion, though, was a key book I stumbled across in high school, the monumental (and monumentally strange)  <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> by Warren Shibles. This book pitched me into a very long internal grapple with my worldview and assumptions.</p>
     
    <p>It wasn't until more than a decade later that I came to realize that I held an  unusually beautiful perspective on humor. Sharing some of the mystery of it with others became a source of pleasure and purpose.</p> 
    
    
     <p>I don't want to overstate my initial undertakings with humor. I became a community organizer, learned to dance, went back to school to study environmental history and train as a professional writer. Through it all, my primary interest wasn't in humor at all&mdash;it was in reknitting people together.</p> 
     
     <p>There's a crisis of alienation and loneliness in the world, where people have an inability to easily experience belonging and connection. It's hollowed out generations of life in North America and elsewhere. I knew from my own experiences that to begin healing places and people from this, there would have to be not just large-scale spatial reconstructions but also social retraining.</p>
    
            <p>As I volunteered, worked, and observed in this context, I drew on my decades of independent humor fieldwork and theorizing&mdash;and what continually struck me was the need almost <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> had for humor education. It wasn't just that complex, integrated skills around humor were off the table. Even  answering basic questions like <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback> was beyond most people's ability.</p>
    
    
    <p>A humor science was so absent that it's hard for most people to even <sem-weak>describe</sem-weak> experiences of alienation or belonging, let chart a course for change. This book aims to remove this root obstacle.</p>
    
<p>As for the relation to humor and belonging&mdash;we all know this. Think about laughing with a stranger or the person you're on a date with. Think about <sem-weak>not</sem-weak> laughing with them. Something similar happens at work or home or school.</p>
    
    <hr>
    
    <p>Most of us never had any formal training in "humor," which makes us suspicious of the whole idea that humor can be taught at all. Partly, this rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things. There are supportive <term>art</term> courses <callback>(even though art is <term>personal</term>)</callback>&mdash;and deep places to go through <term2>geometry</term2> <callback>(even though squares are <term2>intuitive</term2> in some ways)</callback>. It would be a poor world without  any art or geometry teaching.</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. Like art or geometry, there's nothing unusual about humor being both profoundly personal and intuitive while <em>also</em> being able to be supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>
     
     
<p>Due to pervasive mythology and double standards around humor, combined with the minimal weight given to humor in formal institutions&mdash;I don't think it's  an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects that's the least taught. The result is widespread illiteracy in humor.</p> 
    
<p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere. It comes as:</p> 
    
  <ul class="close-list">
       <li>  periodic confusion or missed information around smiling or laughing</li>
        
        <li>limited practical skills around connection and understanding</li>
   
              <li>absent parsing or articulation skills around what humor "means" and does in situation</li>
         
          <li>Sampling biases toward comedy </li>
        
        <li>design choices that struggle to see behavior clearly</li>
         
   
         
         <li>proliferation of incoherent myths or ideas around humor</li>
    
          
        </ul>
        
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

     
     <p>There's also an important general point too. We're often told or given the impression that very real things&mdash;laughter, smiling&mdash;are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account. As is obvious once it's pointed out&mdash;this is nonsense! <callback>(Just imagine someone saying that about crying.)</callback></p>
     
     <p>This forced incoherency&mdash;that the tangible everyday experience of laughing is also so abstract it's not truly thinkable&mdash;creates a sense of powerlessness. It also leads to flawed foundations in our understanding of the world.</p> 
      
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people. I've found that people are ready for the stability, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>
   
   <hr>
    
<p>This book is more than a quick summary. Instead, I want you to actually learn to think and use a particular system of humor. To that end, this book is arranged like a course. Since the chapters are cumulative and build on each other, it's best to read this book straight through, without skipping around.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn a productive theory of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic, incommensurate, or equivative zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p>

        <p>I want to clarify what this book is not. It's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>That means this isn't a book about psychology, neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, commercialization, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research. It's about what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>
    </aside>
</div>
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. By the end of this book, I hope you'll come to see, as I do, that the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
