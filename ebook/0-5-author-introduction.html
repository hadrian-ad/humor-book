</div>
                                                                                                
<p>When I started reading a book called <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>, I figured I would be safe from revolutionary insight&mdash;after all, I had been sitting all my entire life! Surely, I had things well in hand.</p> 
              
<p>Instead, the book hit me like lightning! I again found out that just because something is in front of our nose, that doesn't mean we've really ever actually looked at it closely.  And so a book on observing and thinking about sitting could guid me through patterns and perspectives that I had missed. It was like a magic wand was being waved&mdash;a whole new world came into vision.</p> 
                               
                  
<p>I want to wave this wand of insight for you&mdash;not for sitting, of course, but for <em>humor</em>. Consider it an experiment: what perspectives on smiling and laughing are there for you to discover? And what new worlds will be seen by the end?</p>


<!--
 <p>  You've been laughing and smiling since before you could talk&mdash;since before you had teeth. This lifetime of experience will provide the raw materials that will be used in this book. By resonating observations with your experiences, we'll develop new connections and more refined abilities.</p> 
   
 <p>With enough catalytic insight, we'll set off a chain reaction of understanding around smiling and laughing&mdash;creating a vibrant, comprehensive perspective and framework for humor. </p>
-->
 
    
<p>  
   We'll be covering humor in its full breadth: the smiles we make while sad or angry; the laughter after cruelty, desperation, or kisses; the bright eyes of joy. We'll cover the whens and whys, the magnitudes and outcomes, and clarify a variety of common confusions. It'll be fun, and very interesting! You'll probably smile as we go through all this.</p> 
   
   <p>By the end, I hope that you walk away energized and transformed: the world will have more depth, more joy, more agency.</p> 
       
        <h5>I am a humor teacher</h5>

    <p>I am a humor teacher. That doesn't mean I directly teach people to be "funnier." Instead, I guide people through systems of observation&mdash;with the goal of growing their sensitivity of understanding to their own experiences.</p>
      
        
    <p>While <sem-weak>everyone</sem-weak> notices that we smile and laugh after jokes, I'm always impressed by the range of situations that people <sem-weak>don't</sem-weak> notice that we smile and laugh. For instance, you've probably noticed that you smile when putting on a shirt hot from the dryer&mdash;but maybe never <sem-weak>noticed</sem-weak>  this smile.</p>
       
        <p>By helping people notice all the places we smile and laugh, and connecting them together, I help them arrive at the Big Set of smiling and laughing. By explaining the Big Set, we'll find powerful, broad-beautiful perspectives.</p>
        
    <p>For those primarily interested in comedy <callback>(a small set)</callback>, the Big Set is the richest way to frame that topic. For everyone else, you'll find something here that explains a little bit of everything, richly&mdash;a wise framing of a big thing.</p>
        
<!--
    <p>My roots aren't in comedy, but in community-building. A lot of the observations, fieldwork, and experimentations I used to write this book came from meeting thousands of people a year,  facilitating community dances, hosting friend-making events, motivating volunteers, and so on&mdash;where people will smile or laugh if things are successful.</p> 
      
    <p>In an alternate world, where my foremost passion was comedy, I would be at a comedy club, surrounded by smiling and laughing, and might think: <sem-weak>this is humor</sem-weak>. Instead, by pondering the Big Set of smiling and laughing, of smiles at dances as well as at jokes, I pondered: <sem-weak>what does it all mean?</sem-weak></p>

          <h5>A world content to not know humor</h5> 

    <p>We need humor teachers! Once you know what to look for, there's a strange state of affairs: a world content with not knowing much about humor.</p>
        

   <ul class="close-list">
             <li>In <book-title>The Librarian's Guide to Homelessness</book-title>&mdash;an otherwise crunchy, useful book&mdash;there's a throwaway line where the author says (paraphrasing,  but not by much) <callback>"by the way, humor is the most important thing of all"</callback> and then moves on. Why hide this power, brother?</li>
            
             <li>In the introduction to a book of poetic history, Robert Graves briefly mentions that a sense of humor is required to not go mad and to cure oneself of heartbreak, before not elaborating and moving on. Does he take credit card, or...?</li> 
             
             <li>
                 In <book-title>Custer Died for Your Sins</book-title>, a collection of essays by an indigenous humorist, the author remarks that <callback>"laughter encompasses the limits of the human soul."</callback> It's a nice enough statement&mdash;but does it mean much?</li></ul>
         
         <p>For all these authors, if you pressed them on what, exactly, they meant by "humor," and to articulate why and how it's important&mdash;it's likely there's nothing actually there, other than the most basic observation of all, which is that smiling and laughing feels really good, and does a lot.</p>
         
         <p>This is in no way a criticism of these specific authors. At one point or another, we've all probably exalted humor and then hurried along. The truth is that vanishingly few people are ready to explicate humor in any practical, fleshed-out sort of way.</p> 
        
    <p>And so while it's common to meet people with intuitive excellence in smiling and laughing&mdash;it's very rare to find people who can answer even answering basic questions like <callback>"why did they smile?"</callback> (And that's to say nothing about more complicated, integrated skills or explanations.)</p>  
    
   <p>Since high school, I couldn't stop noticing this: humor was a blank spot on the map for most people, and where there wasn't a kind of inherited silence about it, it was plastered over with generalizations, abstractions, jargon, psychoanalytics, narrow-perspective framings, and so on.</p> 
         
        
        
            
            
    
         
         <p>It's all given rise to a number of silly, interlinked myths, which bother me to no end&mdash;including the persistent one that humor <sem-weak>can't</sem-weak> be taught. That, of course,  describes the <term>speaker</term> more than it describes the <term2>subject</term2>: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback> </p> 
        
        <p>It doesn't have to be this way! And maybe more importantly, it <sem-weak>shouldn't</sem-weak> be that way. We can instead simply treat humor like anything else, and learn about it.</p>
        
        <h5>You can teach and learn humor</h5>
    
    
    <p>Most of us never had any formal training in "humor," which makes us suspicious of the whole idea that humor can be taught at all. Partly, this rests on the widespread consensus that humor doesn't need instruction, since it's personal and intuitive. Bunk!</p>
    
    <p>We know this isn't true by thinking about other things. There are supportive <term>art</term> courses <callback>(even though art is <term>personal</term>)</callback>&mdash;and deep places to go through <term2>geometry</term2> <callback>(even though squares are <term2>intuitive</term2> in some ways)</callback>. It would be a poor world if there were no art or geometry teaching, on the reasoning that it was useless or impossible!</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. Like art or geometry, there's nothing unusual about humor being both profoundly personal and intuitive&mdash;while <em>also</em> being able to be supported with good instruction and explored with guided reasoning.</p>

<h5>A world without belonging</h5>

 
<p>The world's been losing juice. I listened to a famous birder give a speech once, where she described how ecologists understand changes based on their childhood. Her childhood had huge flocks that were absent in her older years. But to newly graduating ecologists, the reduced flocks were normal&mdash;they didn't have an experiential basis for what's missing.</p> 
 
<p>I think about this a lot when thinking about the alienation and loneliness crisis. I grew up in this crisis, and we're all in its teeth everywhere. You can see this crisis just by looking out of almost any window: physical infrastructure that's simply devoid of people. For the majority of people, expectations for a community life amount to almost nothing&mdash;it's been happening for so long, we forget what things have been and could be like.</p> 

<p>What I find personally so pernicious about all this is the difficulty in even <sem-weak>describing</sem-weak> this crisis. Most of us can't talk well about alienation and loneliness. And, of course, we don't just want the <term>absence</term> of loneliness, but the <term2>presence</term2> of  connection&mdash;but how do we talk about this?</p> 

 <p>Smiling and laughing has something to do with this. Just imagine you're in a room with a stranger and you both share a laugh. (Then imagine you <em>don't</em> share a laugh.) You can probably feel the tangible hinge between connection and not connection had something to do with that shared laugh or smile.</p>
 
 <p>We can generalize this to our ability to smile and laugh in the world&mdash;an issue that is both individual <callback>(if we do nothing ourselves we won't laugh)</callback> and systemic <callback>(if others don't support us we'll have less opportunities to laugh)</callback>. That's why engineers, landscapers, architects, event planners, teachers, and <em>everyone</em> need training in humor. It's a way of thinking about connection.</p>

 
 <p>If we're going to heal places and people from this crisis of alienation and loneliness, we're going to need large-scale reconstruction and retraining. But this can't be done through jargon and astract thinking. 
 Instead, it has to be based on something that's tangible and understood by everyone, and seen as common sense, and can be talked about in relatively ordinary language. Everyone will have to join in.</p>

            <p>I'm sure you know the story of the Three Blind Men, who come across an elephant, but can't generalize from one touch what it is they've encountered: 
             </p>
             
              <ul class="close-list">
              <li>one man touches a tail and declares the elephant is a rope</li>

<h5>Ending humor illiteracy, together.</h5>
 
 
<p>Due to pervasive mythology and double standards around humor, combined with the minimal weight given to humor in formal institutions&mdash;I don't think it's  an exaggeration to say that humor is one of the most important subjects that's the least taught. The result is widespread illiteracy in humor.</p> 
    
<p>I see the consequences of humor illiteracy everywhere:</p> 
   
 
      <ul class="close-list">
    <li><b>We get confused.</b> We encounter smiling or laughing that perplexes us. Sometimes humor can be troubling or upsetting, and our confusion about it can make things worse.</li>
    
    <li><b>We can't describe things.</b> We have underdeveloped articulation skills about what humor "means" or "does." We often simply don't talk about it&mdash;but if we do we often offer incomplete statements or simply trail off.</li> 
     
     <li><b>We have limited practical frameworks.</b> We usually rely on intuitive or ad hoc processes, without a complementary formal way of thinking about smiling and laughing.</li>
      
      
       <li><b>We have sampling biases.</b> When we think of "humor" we think of comedy shows, even though the majority of our smiling and laughing happens away from those things. </li>
       
       <li><b>We don't notice <i>all</i> smiles and laughs.</b> We notice smiles and laughs after jokes&mdash;outside that context, we often have only a quasi-awareness of the smiles and laughs that happen around us. We may have never thought about whether a scoff is a kind of laugh or not.</li>
       
       <li><b>We rely on circular statements.</b> Definitions of humor and related words tend to be circular. This tends to happen especially when descriptive terms are substituted for mechanisms. <callback>("Why is it a farce? Because I laughed. Why did I laugh? Because it's a farce")</callback></li>
                        
        <li><b>We argue about jokes.</b> People may defend themselves by discussing intention or genre <callback>("it was just joke!")</callback>, and it can be hard to sort through these situations.</li>
                         
     <li><b>We lack advanced decision skills.</b> If we're choosing between two tables for our kitchen, which of the two will lead to the most smiling and laughing, and why? We may not feel this framing is justified or well-understood.</li>

      <li><b>We accept myths around humor.</b> We tend to hold ideas about humor that fall apart when given even cursory examination&mdash;like that some people are born funny, and that some people aren't.</li>
      
      <li><b>We fall into "blind men" problems.</b> In the parable, blind men were unable to generalize from one touch what an elephant was. <callback>("It's a rope! No it's a tree trunk! No it's a curtain!")</callback>. We often do something similar: we say humor is just one of cruel, kind, insightful, frivolous, or so on&mdash;instead of finding a big picture perspective.</li>

      
      <li><b>We struggle to articulate ideas around belonging and connection.</b> Have you ever shared a laugh with a stranger and felt connection? More generalized, have you smiled a lot some places, and not in others? All the problems above contribute to challenges in thinking  about belonging and connection.</li>
       
     </ul>
     
  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>     
    
    <p>Humor illiteracy is a problem! Luckily, it's not just easy to fix&mdash;it's fun to fix. Learning about humor feels good, and has positive ramifications everywhere in our lives.</p>
    
<h5>Humor is not more abstract than anything else</h5>
    

     
       <p>I want to emphasize an important general point around humor and abstraction. Sometimes we're told, or given the impression, that laughing and smiling are somehow too abstract to be known or taken into account or clearly understood.</p> 
     
     <p>As is obvious as soon as it's pointed out: that's nonsense!  Smiling and laughing are very real things. Physical things! They exist, like rocks and trees! They happen, like rain or budding! <callback>(Just imagine someone saying that <sem-weak>crying</sem-weak> was too abstract to be taken into account.)</callback></p>
          
     <p>This forced incoherence&mdash;that the tangible, everyday experience of laughing is also so abstract it's not actually thinkable&mdash;creates a sense of powerlessness. It's a bit like someone telling you that a rose is an unfathomable metaphor and let's leave it at that. It hurts to empty our gardens that way.</p>
     

      
 <p>I think this is part of why serious instruction on humor has resonated with so many people&mdash;It's a way of filling our gardens. I've found that people are ready for the stability, connective resonance, and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing. I wager you're ready too!</p>
   

   
<h5>The journey ahead</h5>
    
<p>This book is more than a quick summary. Instead, I want you to actually learn to think with and use a particular system of humor. (As you probably suspect, there is no "one" way to talk about humor&mdash;this is just one way I find particularly useful and beautiful.)</p> 
  
  <p>That's why this book has been set up to <em>teach</em>. We'll use enough examples and figures to clearly go from one observation to another. The chapters are cumulative and build on each other&mdash;and so it's best to read this book straight through, without skipping around.</p>
   
    <p>You'll learn a productive theory of humor, and apply some coherence to what's often an anarchic, incommensurate, or equivocating zone of definitions, genres, assumptions, and more.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
  
        <p>I want to clarify what this book is not. It's not a scholarly book&mdash;I'm not going to catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p>
        
        <p>That means this isn't a book about psychology, neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research and observational philosophy. It's about what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>
        
    </aside>
</div>
     
 <p>I've developed this method of teaching humor over the course of two decades&mdash;and I am beyond excited that you're about to start. By the end of this book, I hope you'll be a philosopher of smiling and laughing, just like you were always meant to be&mdash;and come to see, as I do, that the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge.</p>

        <b>About me.</b> I work in society reconstruction, with a focus in event design, community networking, and placemaking. These experiences underly the focus of this book, which is on interpersonal and environmental elements of humor.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as an environmental historian and professional writer at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught. I read full-time for a number of years, while undergoing a number of similarly formative experiences core to my understanding of humor&mdash;like learning to partner dance, talk to strangers, observe space, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>I started down the path of intense humor observation at the outset of high school, when I encountered the free and bizarre materials on humor by Warren Shibles&mdash;a man whose neurodivergent unconventionalities are inescabable in his works, but who impressed me profoundly with his determination to base legitimacy in knowledge around joy.</p> 
        
        <p>His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives&mdash;but was a work of tilted clarity.</p> 
        
        <p>Inaccessible and incomplete, for me it made made every other work or discussion on humor feel unsophisticated and rudimentary&mdash;and this tension was the power that drove me to create this teaching book on humor.</p>
