<p>In this chapter, we'll look at how spectator entertainment is <vocab>surreal.</vocab> 

<p>It's obvious that fight scenes are surreal:</p>

<!--
<div class="consider"><aside class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>The things depicted in spectator entertainment <em>can't</em> happen without effort and the intention to prioritize others&mdash;what we're calling surreal.</p>
        
    
        
        <p>This effort can't happen without effort and intention&mdash;these surreal things can't straightforwardly happen spontaneously in our life.</p>
        
        
        <p>Anything from rehearsal to a replay button to stage make-up contribute to this surrealness&mdash;a sometimes subtle or hard-to-see distinction .</p>

<p>Emma and Owen know this is surreal&mdash;they don't go around thinking that they could elegantly decapitate henchmen with keyboards.</p>

        <p>It doesn't matter to Emma and Owen that <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title> is surreal. They aren't looking for realism for realism’s sake&mdash;since they want the movie to <term>entertain</term> them, not to <term2>teach</term2> them how to fight with keyboards.</p>
   </aside>
    </div>

<p>But while it’s often obvious to us that <term>action</term> scenes are surreal, we don’t always think of <term2>comedy</term2> scenes as being equally surreal&mdash;but they are!</p>

<p>Above, the comedy scene is surreal. In the same way <term>Rage Man's actor</term> can't be like <term>Rage Man</term> <callback>(use grit to survive missiles)</callback>, <term2>Chief's actor</term2> can't be like <term2>Chief</term2> <callback>(be somewhere important when unqualified and avoiding discipline)</callback>.</p> 

<p>For similar reasons, Owen can't survive damage like Rage Man, or fail his way through a moonbase. Just because we can <term>present</term> a surreal thing doesn't mean it can be <term2>experienced</term2> 1:1 by real people.</p>

             There's nothing wrong with surreal things&mdash;instead, <sem-weak>we</sem-weak> can be wrong if we don't spot surreal things.</p> 
             
             <p>
             Partly, it's a matter of apples and oranges. There are two things: <term>acting</term> in a fight scene, and actually <term2>fighting</term2> someone. If Owen confuses the two, he can make inaccurate comparisons or judgements.</p>
             
             <p>It's the same for spectator entertainment. There are two skills: <term>producing</term> a funny conversation scene, and actually <term2>generating </term2>humor in a day-to-day conversation. These are apples and oranges.</p>

   <aside class="box">  <p><b>Coherent and surreal.</b>  
         
           When the audience watches Rage Man punch through concrete in the opening scene of <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title>, the audience knows this is surreal&mdash;people can't punch through concrete.</p> 
         
         <p>But even though it's a <term>surreal</term> premise, Rage Man's strength can still be <term2>coherent</term2> to that premise. Rage Man can punch through concrete throughout the movie, making his strength both surreal and coherent. But it's still surreal!</p>
         
         <p>This is often obvious for physical things, like punching through concrete. But it's the same for emotions too. 
         
         <p>If Rage Man is always angry, the surreal emotional premise is that he always has a large mistake and small OK. But just because the movie is coherent to this premise, doesn't mean it's realistic&mdash;since real people are calm from time to time.</p>  
      
     <!--
           If James Bond is always calm or focused, the emotional premise is that he always has a large OK and small mistake. We know this is surreal&mdash;people aren't calm when gambling, fighting, debating, and so on.
     -->
     

     <p>This is relevant to comedies, where the character's emotional reactions may be coherent to a surreal emotional premise&mdash;and we shouldn't take it as more realistic than it is.</p>
