    <p>
    Do people go <callback>"ha ha ha?"</callback> Not really&mdash;not any more than cars go <callback>"vroom!"</callback> or falling pancakes go <callback>"splat!"</callback></p> 
    
     <p>That's why people in the United States tend to write <callback>"ha ha ha,"</callback> but many people in Europe tend to write <callback>"ah ah ah" </callback>instead&mdash;and why the convention in Brazil for a while was to write <callback>"kkkkkkk."</callback> Since these are just conventions for indicating laughter, so they vary.</p> 
     
    
    <div class="consider">
        <aside class="consider">
            <consider>Consider:</consider>
                <p class=considertext>What sound do cats make? English speakers say cats go <callback>"meow,"</callback> but German speakers say cats go <callback>"miau,"</callback>&mdash;and Japanese speakers <callback>"nya."</callback></p> 
                
                <p class=considertext>These aren't meant to be "real" noises cats make&mdash;since cats make all kinds of nontranscribable noises. Instead, <callback>"meow,"</callback> <callback>"miau,"</callback> <callback>"nya,"</callback> and so on are just abstract conventions. It's the same with written laughter.</p>
        </aside>
    </div>
                       
    <p>There's no exact way to transcribe even a single instance of laughing&mdash;let alone one way to transcribe <sem-weak>all</sem-weak> the variations of a laugh. Something  like <callback>"ha ha ha"</callback> is just how some people choose to <sem-weak>reference</sem-weak> laughter in writing.</p>
                        
   
    
    <p>Sometimes people take these conventions too seriously. <callback>"Moo"</callback> is the written word for the noises cows makes&mdash;which isn't how a cow literally sounds. But if we take written conventions too seriously, we start expecting cows to literally be saying <callback>"moo"</callback> over and over again&mdash;which is a bit like expecting a pancake to say <callback>"splat!"</callback> when it falls onto the floor.</p>
        
<p>Something similar happens with laughter. Actors sometimes literally say <callback>"ha ha ha"</callback> because that's how it's written&mdash;like how Santa actors will often literally say <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> because that's how it's written.</p> 
            
    <p><callback>"Ho ho ho"</callback> was a written convention for Santa, since it conveyed more of a good-natured, full-body laugh than other vowels. <callback>("Ha ha ha," "huh huh huh," "hee hee hee," and so on.</callback>) But actually <em>saying</em> <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> aloud instead of laughing is a bit odd&mdash;like an actor literally saying <callback>"zzz"</callback> when pretending to sleep, or a video editor adding the spoken word <callback>"bam!"</callback> to the sound of a discharging gun.</p>
       
    <p>There's nothing inherently wrong with saying <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback>&mdash;since, like any spectator humor profile, <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> serves various purposes outside of being realistic. However, <em>we</em> can be wrong if we lose sight that these spectator humor profiles are surreal&mdash;and not literally laughter.</p>

<p>We have patterns of humor tells that comprise humor profiles. Something analagous happens in spectator entertainment to create <vocab>spectator humor profiles</vocab>. These convey evaluatory information in a way that supports the medium or audience.</p>

<ul>
  
  <li>We can usually <a href="14-01-we-can-distinquish-spectator-humor-profiles.html">distinquish</a> between spontaneous reactions and goal-oriented reactions. </li>
  
   <li>When we become familiar with different <a href="14-02-media-constraints-shape-spectator-humor-profiles.html">spectator humor profiles</a>, they start seeming normal&mdash;but normal is different than "real." These spectator humor profiles aren't perfect mirrors of our lives&mdash;they're surreal.
   </li> 
   
   <li>Live-action actors can't always produce realistic laughs on demand&mdash;and while voice actors can't either, <a href="14-05-animated-laughter-uses-laugh-like-noises.html">repetitive noises</a> effectively convey evaluatory information in animation.</li>
