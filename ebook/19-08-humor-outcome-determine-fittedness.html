<p>Yasmin sees Trevor's humor attempt here as efficiently doing many relevant things at once&mdash;and this efficiency is part of why she sees it as fitted.</p>

<p>We understand or tolerate things that are efficient and well-fitted to the situation. This gives them a justification that protects them from pushback.</p>

        <p>We saw this earlier with an analogy to placing a garden. People may not see the justification for putting a garden in an unsuitable spot, and so may question why the garden was put there ant not elsewhere.</p>
        
        <p>By contrast, if we put a garden in a well-fitted spot, people will feel the harmony of interconnected relevance to the decision justifies why the garden is there, and not elsewhere.</p>
        
        <p>The point here isn't that fittedness should <em>compel</em> an action. Instead, the point is that fittedness creates resistance to criticism.</p>
