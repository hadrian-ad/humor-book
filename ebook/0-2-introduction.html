<p>I've heard it said many times&mdash;you can't teach humor. In my experience, that's a myth! It usually describes the speaker more than the subject. <callback>"Humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback></p>

<p>Humor isn't unfathomable&mdash;which is why you'll be learning a whole lot about humor in this book!</p> 

<p>There's probably more to learn than you think. This sense of unexpected exploration is what makes puzzling through humor so rewarding and fun.</p>

<div class="consider">

    <p>This book is for regular people! It's expected that you smile and laugh, just like everyone.</p> 
    
    <p>However, this book is particularly for insightful people who want to mature their understanding of things.</p>

<p>It's one of life's funny tragedies that humor isn't taught more. Just about everyone will raise their hand if you ask them if they've taken a geometry class&mdash;the same can't be said of a humor class.</p> 

<p>The tragedy is that, unlike Euclidean planes, <em>all</em> of our favorite experiences have involved us smiling and laughing. Without instruction, it's then left to our individual science or initiative to make sense of  good experiences.</p>

<p>The result is that most of us are on the backfoot when it comes to all the uses of humor&mdash;making friends, calming tensions, supporting arguments, gauging people's opinions, and so on.</p>

<p>
We all laugh at jokes and comedies&mdash;sometimes, anyway.</p>

<p>But let's look beyond those things. Have you ever:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>put on a shirt hot from the dryer <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    <li>biked downhill <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    <li>saw your favorite coworker <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    <li>heard someone make a great point <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    <li>came to a scenic overlook <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    <li>assessed bad news <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    <li>teased or got teased <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    <li>got a really good hug <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    <li>had lots of snot from crying <callback>(and laughed?)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Once it's pointed out, it's obvious we smile and laugh after more than just jokes and comedies. What's going on here?</p>

<p>In this book, we'll look at the Big Idea that explains <em>all</em> instances of smiling and laughing&mdash;jokes as well as hugs</p> 

<p>We'll find explanations that are powerful, and have relevance to our lives, goals, and dreams.</p>

<div class="consider"><aside class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>
         
          <p>The present-day word "dream" has uncertain etymology&mdash;but the Old English <i>dream</i> meant <callback>joy, mirth, and noisy merriment (music, celebrations etc)</callback>.</p>
          
          <p>This is one of a number of interesting and often surprising elements of humor hiding in our life and history&mdash;which we'll be exploring as we go through this book.</p>
          
          </aside>
    </div>
    
<p>While <term>summarizing</term> an explanation can be done quickly, actually <term2>learning</term2> them takes longer. This book is isn't a summary&mdash;it's an in-depth tool for developing skills and useful perspectives.</p> 

<p>We'll develop these through 27 carefully-sequenced chapters, which use more than 600 examples and 300 figures&mdash;making this a practical course for serious instruction on humor.</p>

    
<p>In many ways, the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge. This is something that will be clear as we progress through the book.</p>


<aside class="box">
        <p><headline>Not.</headline> There are a few things this book is not. It's not a scholarly book&mdash;this book will not catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p> 
        
        <p>That means this also isn't a book about neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, business models for comedy, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research&mdash;and of what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I am a humor theorist and teacher&mdash;my day work is in community-building and placemaking. This underlies my perspectives on humor, which tend to focus first on interpersonal and environmental elements.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as a professional writer and environmental historian at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles. These experiences influenced the style and emphases I chose for this book.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught&mdash;I read full-time for several years while learning to partner dance and host gatherings. This period of exploration gave me some independence of thought, giving me some detachment from received ideas about humor.</p>
        
        <p>I am indebted to Warren Shibles, a forgetten academic I never met. In high school, I came across his self-published and monumentally weird <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;a  work of tilted clarity that set me down this path years ago.</p>

<p>Suspician can be warranted, however. One of my favorite books on how <em>not</em> to write about humor has a pretty unforgettable opening:</p>
 
  <div class="vignette">
  <p>Being around laughing crowds always distrubs me.</p> 
  </div>
  
<p>Now if you're me, you beam and laugh at that statement. What a way to open a book on humor! However, it's a demonstration of of the tug-of-war that has happened over something as charged and foundational as smiling and laughing.</p> 

<p>After all, we've been smiling and laughing since before we could speak or understand words&mdash;before we had teeth&mdash;the subject of humor gets at a primary understanding of ourselves. Hence the tug-of-war.</p>

<p>When I attended university, I was surprised by</p>

  
<p>Welcome to this classic manual to humor&mdash;time and time again, it's left readers with the sticky sense that the world is more beautiful and elegant than they had supposed.</p>
       
<p>Almost all the best experience in our lives have involved smiling and laughing&mdash;and yet, it's not always easy to describe the <i>what, why, when,</i> and <i>how much</i> of it all.</p>
             
<p>It's a bit like trying to describe why we love the music we love&mdash;we open our mouth to try to capture it and the words aren't there. But like music, humor is something that can be taught&mdash;we can learn how to think about and describe it, which suppports <sem-weak>using</sem-weak> it.</p>
             
<p>It's a myth that humor can't be taught. Usually, that describes the speaker more than the subject: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback> Like any subject, we can find good ways to think about it.</p>
              
<p>Readers of this book often attest to the same pleasing quality of "surprising obviousness" to this book&mdash;we re-view familiar experiences and tease out some shared structure between them. It initiates us into a useful and profound way of seeing the world.</p>

 <p>My earliest memory of laughing is from when I was six&mdash;I had somehow trapped my arm under a moving treadmill. As the belt scraped skin off me, I yelled until my dad ran in and turned the treadmill off.</p>
 
<p>I sobbed as my dad examined my arm, and then&mdash;he made me laugh.</p> 

<p>I remember not wanting to, but the laugh bubbling out anyway.</p>

<p>This was a special talent of my dad&mdash;my siblings and I would often compare notes about this magic ability of his, to make us laugh when we cried. It seemed inexplicable.</p> 

<p>My dad's odd sense of humor was a frequent topic of conversation and marvel among us&mdash;he could sit through an entire season of a comedy show without laughing once&mdash;but would chuckle when he saw people get hurt&mdash;and could pleasingly summarize books or experiences in ways that would make us laugh.</p>

<p>This was all something beyond easy explanation&mdash;and so, like most people, we admired the mystery and didn't get much further.</p> 

<p>A lot of us hover at that point: admiring the mystery without getting further.</p> 

<p>You've probably noticed that there's something hard to put into words about humor. It can feel like trying to put on a bedsheet that's too small, and whenever we try to pull it over a corner it just pops off somewhere else.</p>

<p>Is humor trivial, or consequential? It is destructive, or constructive? Is it related to lies, or to truth? <i>Pop</i> the bedsheet pops off.</p>

<p>This book is designed to give us the nudge to go deeper, to a place where everything clicks into place&mdash;the Big Understanding of humor.</p>

<p>I spent two decades carefully observing smiling and laughing, and over many interactions and lectures developed a method of teaching and understanding humor&mdash;and this book is the end result.</p> 
  
  <p>You'll learn a useful model of humor that you can carry with you wherever you go&mdash;and it's my hope that re-encountering humor through this book brings you insight, joy, and wonder.</p>
