    <h3 id="25-02">We can average humor over time by topic</h3>

<p>We can associate humor bushes  with specific topics.</p>

<p>For instance, when Zoe’s topic ‘taking the bus’ is active, the topic tracks the average humor felt over time:</p>

     >
 
<p>Zoe has a humor bush with 'taking the bus.' This humor bush isn't related to <em>all</em> the humor Zoe has felt, about <em>everything</em>. It's just related to the humor she's felt about taking the bus.</p>

<p>This is useful when we want to think about humor over various timescales&mdash;so not just the average humor felt over <term>two minutes</term> as she boarded the bus, but also the average humor she's felt over <term2>several years</term2> of riding the busses near campus.</p>

<div class="consider">
 <aside class="consider">
         <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>We can set different time or topic bounds for humor bushes. We can look at Zoe's humor from a <term>single</term> bus route or from <term2>all</term2> bus routes&mdash;or from this year, or the last ten years.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, we could look at Zoe's humor bush with Emma, Zoe's university, or any other combination of topics we like.</p>
   </aside> </div>



<!--
<div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>We can segment humor bushes by smaller topics too&mdash;like by breaking down 'taking the bus' into 'taking route 11' and 'taking route 47.' These smaller topics will have their own humor bushes.</p>
        
    <p>If route 11 is always crowded and she has to stand, while she gets to sit with Emma on route 47, 'taking route 47' will have a larger humor bush than 'taking route 11.'</p> </div>
