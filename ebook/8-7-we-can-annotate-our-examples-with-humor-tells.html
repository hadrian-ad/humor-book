Annotating humor with humor tells
</h2>

<p>We previously used examples of humor family words and said they were  <emotions>humor</emotions>. We can use humor tells to describe what this humor looked like:</p>

<!--

<p>Humor tells help us spot when people are feeling humor family words&mdash;since we show humor tells when we feel <emotions>safety</emotions> after a jump scare, <emotions>achievement</emotions> after a success, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> after an apology, and so on.</p>

-->
   <aside class="box">
         <p><headline>Absence.</headline> Trevor didn’t show many humor tells after the jump scare&mdash;because he wasn’t really feeling much <emotions>safety</emotions>! Trevor mostly shows inverse humor tell:</p> 
        
        <ul class="close-list">
           <li>instead of <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>tightens</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell></li>
            <li>instead of <humor-tell>feeling optimism</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>feels dread</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell></li>
            <li>instead of <humor-tell>flushing</humor-tell>, he <emotion-tell><outcome-contrast>pales</outcome-contrast></emotion-tell></li>
            </ul>
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
        
        <p>While Trevor also shows a few humor tells, like <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>, these are also anxiety tells or fear tells. Emotion tells often count for more than one emotion&mdash;which means <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> can double count as both a humor tell and mistake-predominance tell.</p>
        
        <p>In this case, we’d say Trevor has <term>some</term> humor in his emotional state after the jump scare&mdash;but that he’s <term2>mostly</term2> feeling discomfort or irritation.</p>
