Most humor is low-intensity
</h3>


<p>Most of the humor we feel isn’t very intense. <term>Sometimes</term> our humor crests into laughter, but <term2>most</term2> of the time, our humor happens at lower intensities&mdash;like how we bounce, hum, smile, talk excitedly, whistle, and so on more often than we <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>:</p>

alt="This evaluation graph tracks intensity of humor. The intensity has a small bump that's labeled with 'talk excitedly' before falling back down."

<p>And even when our humor <term>crests</term> into laughter, our laughter is still <term2>bookended</term2> by lower-intensity humor&mdash;like below, where the peak of loud laughter is bookended by talking excitedly and bouncing.</p>

title="We feel humor outside the crest of humor."
alt="This evaluation graph tracks intensity of humor. The crest of intensity is labled 'loud laughter.' On the upswing and downswing of the crest is labeled 'talk excitedly' and 'bouncing' respectively. Annotations say that if we only think humor is the peak ('loud laughter') we'll miss most of the humor we feel ('bouncing')"

<p>
    If we think of humor is <term>only</term> the peak moments of intense humor (loud <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>), we’ll end up ignoring <term2>most</term2> of the humor we feel.</p>

        At first, “talk excitedly” doesn't seem like humor. But we "talk excitedly" is often a <em>composite</em> of humor tells&mdash;when someone talks excitedly, they’re <humor-tell>socially integrating</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>socially tightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>having high energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>thinking fast</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raising speaking register</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

    <aside class="box">
        <p><headline>Blindness.</headline> If we only thought of sadness as sobbing, we’d be blind to most of the sadness people feel. Sadness <sem-weak>sometimes</sem-weak> crest into a climactic expression (<emotion-tell>sobbing</emotion-tell> or <emotion-tell>wailing</emotion-tell>), but it doesn't always.</p> 
        
        <p>Instead, we often have low-intensity sadness where we just <emotion-tell>feel dispirited</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>have low-energy</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>get tired easily</emotion-tell>, <emotion-tell>feel pessimistic</emotion-tell>, and so on. This is sadness too&mdash;whether or not sobbing is ever involved.</p>
        
             
        <p>It's the exact same for humor. In the same way that <emotions>sadness</emotions> is more than just <emotion-tell>sobbing</emotion-tell>, <emotions>humor</emotions> is more than just <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>. We don't want to be blind to low-intensity humor&mdash;or to how low-intensity humor bookends moments of high-intensity humor.</p>
