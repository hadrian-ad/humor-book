	Minh and Amaya were worried that they had frayed their social ties. When this mistake was balanced with an OK, they felt mutual <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>&mdash;humor. 
</p>
<p>
	Since <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> is an emotion of humor, that means an apology is successful when it generates humor.</p>

    title="Reconciliation involves humor"
    alt="In this comparison of two evaluation graphs, moment A marks Owen's apology. In the first graph, it leads to the mistake and OK balancing, leading to reconciliation. In the other graph, the apology doesn't bring the mistake and OK into balance, which doesn't lead to reconciliation."

<p>
	When we’re apologizing, it’s often hard to pay attention to this humor. We’re often intensely focused on other things&mdash;but once it’s pointed out, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> is a familiar instance of humor.
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>
            To successfully reconcile with someone, we <term>both</term> need to feel humor&mdash;but more specifically, feel humor on <term2>relevant</term2> topics. Owen can’t just make Emma laugh by imitating a professor and calling that shared humor <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, Owen and Emma have to activate <em>specific</em> topics related to the interpersonal rupture, and then feel humor on those specific topics. This gives their humor the situational integration that lets us call it <emotion>reconciliation</emotion>.
        </p>

  <aside class="box">
          <p><b>Emotional straightforwardness.</b> Jokes are often emotionally straightforward compared to apologies. Reading a random joke from a jokebook might involve a few random topics&mdash;but an apology may involve <em>many</em> relevant topics:</p>
        
            <img
            src="../images/7c-images-humor-family-words/7-9-reconciliation-as-humor/7-9-1-complications-box.png"
            title="We don't always recognize humor in complicated emotional states"
            alt="This image compares two emotional state boxes. The first emotion box says 'emotional state after jokebook joke.' There are two topics that contribute some disgust to the emotional state but mostly humor. An annotation says 'humor is easier to notice in a straightforward emotional state.' Next to it is another emotional state box, labeled 'emotional state after acceptance or apology.' There are four topics generating humor, sadness, regret, and embarassment into the box, creating a more complicate emotional state. An annotation says 'humor is harder to notice in a complex emotional state."
            style="max-width:37rem;">
        
            <p>
                With so much going on in complicated emotional states, we sometimes lose track of humor. But as we learn to look for it, it becomes easier and easier to register humor in these situations.
