Evaluations are tied to topics
</h3>
  
<p>
    We're always evaluating mistakes and OKs. But the <vocab>topic</vocab> of those evaluations change frequently:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Emma and Zoe are at the library.</narration>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*hands on head*</action> <action>*staring at laptop*</action> <speech>“As we get closer to the end of the semester, everything gets worse.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma's evaluations are on topic ‘university courses’)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Well, I just usually try to get all my work done a month or two early.”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“That’s not helpful!”</speech>
    </p>
    <p class="or">- LATER -</p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“How’s Max been these days?”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“You know. Really nice."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma's evaluations are on topic ‘relationship with Max’)</notes>
    </p>
    <p class="or">- LATER -</p>
    <p>
        <narration>Owen sits down with Zoe and Emma.</narration>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*grinning*</action> <action>*giving cupcake*</action> <speech>“Happy birthday Zoe!”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*beaming*</action> <speech>“Thanks, Owen!”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(shocked)</internalaction> <action>*thinking*</action> <speech>“How'd I forget Zoe’s birthday!?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma's evaluations are on topic ‘Zoe’s birthday’)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Emma is rotating through different topics. Each topic has its own track of mistake and OK:</p>

    <img
    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-1-we-can-sort-evaluations-into-topics/6-1-0-introduction-to-topics.png"
    title="Each topic has its own track of mistake and OK"
    alt="This image has three topics, represented as small circles. An arrow points out to three labeled evaluation graphs, like 'Zoe's birthday', 'relationship with Max,' and 'university courses."
    style="max-width:25rem;">


    <p>
        We use topics pragmatically. So we can lump all of Emma's courses together as one topic <callback>('university courses')</callback>. But we can also separate each course into its own topic:
    </p>
    <div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(tired)</internalaction> <speech>"This semester's been hard."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma is on topic 'university courses')</notes>
        </p>
        <p>
            <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(sympathetically)</internalaction> <speech>“Too much graph theory, huh?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe is on topic ‘discrete mathematics’)</notes>
        </p>
        <p>
            <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“At least graph theory is <i>fun</i>! But I couldn’t even get through the first page of <i>Paracelsus</i>! So how am I supposed to write an entire fucking essay on Robert Browning by next week?</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma is on topic ‘19th century English literature’)</notes>
        </p>
    </blockquote>

    title="We can use topics pragmatically"
    alt="This image shows a larger cicle with an arrow leading to an evaluation graph of 'university courses.' A double-sided arrow leads to two smaller circles representing 'discrete mathematics' and '19th century English literature.' An annotation notes that we can split or combine topics as we think is useful." 
    style="max-width:32rem;">

<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Lumping and splitting.</headline> We use topics just for our own convenience. This is why we can lump them together or split them apart however we think will be useful:</p>
    
        <img

        title="Lumping and splitting topics"
        alt="This image shows fifty circles all being combined into a single circle. Next to this, one circle is being split into three circes. Annotations say that we can lump or split topics."

    <p>
        This is like how we create to-do lists. Sometimes a general task like 'clean the kitchen' meets our needs. But other times, we want to split this task into component tasks:
    </p>
       <div class="list-in-text">
                     <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
            <li>Clean the kitchen</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="and-so-on">- INTO -</p>
            <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
               <li>Sweep the floor</li>
                <li>Wash the counters</li>
                <li>Do the dishes</li>
                </ul>
                    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
        </div>
    <p>
        We chose how abstract or specific our to-do list is based on what we think will be useful. It's the same with topics. We can use them at our discretion&mdash;and there's no fixed, one-size-fits-all way of scaling them.
