    <h3 id="20-02">We can set up our own hooks</h3>
    
   
<p>People can telegraph hooks to us&mdash;but we can also create <em>our own</em> opportunities to push for humor family words.</p> 

<p>Heather does this below&mdash;she sets up her own hook, and then follows it herself:</p>

<div class="vignette"> 
     
    <blockquote>
          <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <action>*looking at screen*</action> <speech>“Remember when you won that online tournament in this game?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Heather creates her own hook)</notes> <speech>"That was fun!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Heather tries to make Xiaowei feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>)</notes></p>
         
         <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Xiaowei feels <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>)</notes> <speech>“I didn’t <em>win</em> mom. We got second place in a regular diamond-onyx tournament.”</speech> </p>
     </blockquote>
     
     </div>
     
     
<p>This often happens in speeches, where a speaker often makes decisions over which topics are active:</p> 

<div class="vignette">

   <blockquote> <p><narration>Lina shushes everyone. The principal is about to come in! The drama team quiets as Sam enters the classroom.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <speech>“Hello everyone. I just wanted to stop by to say&mdash;congratulations! First place in regionals? For the first time in Panther history&mdash;wow!”</speech> <action>*crowd smiles and murmurs to each other*</action> <notes>(&larr;audience feels <emotions>achievement</emotions>)</notes> </p>
        
        <p><speech>“I also wanted to apologize for that mix-up with the auditorium scheduling, and that we were so slow in getting that fixed. I…”</speech> <action>*laughs regretfully*</action> <notes>(&larr;speaker feels <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>)</notes> <speech>“…take responsibility for that lapse in communication, and we’ll work to do better in the future. I’m afraid that that week we gave a bad name to school administrators everywhere&mdash;ahem, for the first time in history.”</speech> <action>*audience laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;audience feels <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speech>“But you should know just how proud of you guys the entire school is, from Mrs. Jenson to Mrs. Gardener."</speech> <action>*crowd smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;audience feels <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>)</notes></p> 
        
        <p><speech>“Still, I have to say…”</speech> <internalaction>(earnestly)</internalaction> <speech>“…this is the best darn drama team in Pennsylvania. No, I mean that! I realized this when I went to a conference in Philly, and I talked about this group there. Did you know most schools only fund Drama Dream competitions when they have <sem-weak>forty</sem-weak> people signed up?”</speech> <action>*audience murmurs and laughs in surprise*</action> <notes>(&larr;audience feels <emotions>revelation</emotions>)</notes></p> 
        
        <p><speech>“But everyone in this room stepped up to win, even with less than half that number. And that’s why everyone here deserves a round of applause.”</speech> <action>*claps*</action> <action>*crowd claps and cheers*</action> <notes>(&larr;audience feels <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>)</notes></p> 
        
        <p><speech>“That’s why I’m so proud to announce a special honor for us today. The state director of Drama Dream herself has decided to stop by today and personally give the school the award&mdash;1st place in the third annual Drama Dream Comp!!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><narration>The director walks in smiling, and the crowd laughs in shock.</narration> <notes>(&larr;audience feels <emotions>delight</emotions>)</notes></p> </blockquote>

    <p>When Sam activates a topic, he can follow that topic's hook into fitted humor attempts.</p>
    
<div class="for-instance">
<aside class="consider"><consider>For instance:</consider>
            <p>If Sam activates a topic involving anger, he knows in advance that trying to make them feel <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> is the path to fitted humor.</p>

            </div>
        
         <p>Sam's use of fitted humor makes his speech feels enjoyable, engaging, personal, meaningful, thoughtful, and so on. </p>
