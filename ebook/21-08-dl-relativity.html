  <p>It's not surprising that there are places with high dress codes&mdash;like advocacy organizations, charities, classrooms, international offices, big-tent political parties, public agencies, and so on. These all are goal-oriented groups <callback>(need effectiveness)</callback> and have varied clients, customers, members, supporters, and so on <callback>(need cohesion)</callback>.</p>
                      
    <p>This means that our humor dress code goes <term>up</term> as we're interfacing with these groups, and goes <term2>down</term2> again when we’re not. These groups want to avoid pointlessly fragmenting the emotion networks associated with them, while at the same time promoting effective actions.</p>
    
    <p>From the outside looking in, we can feel a relative gap with their dress code&mdash;from the outside, <em>we</em> won't have the same need for efficiency or cohesion. This can make us criticize  their humor dress codes, and feel that they would be stifling to incorporate into our own lives.</p>
    
    <p>That's probably true! At the same time, we shouldn't judge humor dress codes by whether we should incorporate them into every situation. We're <em>not</em> supposed to incorporate those dress codes&mdash;they've been set for different needs than we have.</p> 

     <p>There may be good reasons to criticize an institution's humor dress code&mdash;but the fact that their dress code is different than our dress code at home by itself isn't a good reason.</p>

<p>Humor or humor attempts need a minimum amount of fittedness to be fitted. However, this minimum amount is constantly changing. This changing minimum amount is the "humor dress code."</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    Humor dress codes change as our needs for <a href="21-02-humor-dress-codes-are-set-by-regular-patterns.html">efficiency and cohesion</a> change.</li>
    
<li>The humor dress code is the <a href="21-02-humor-dress-codes-are-set-by-regular-patterns.html">minimum standard for the complexity and coherence</a> of our interactions. This doesn't weed out humor, so much as weed out the things that don't match the needs of the moment.</li>
    
<li>Humor dress codes are set in <a href="21-05-the-final-dress-code-is-set-by-collaboration.html">collaboration</a> with everyone around us. If not everyone agrees, words are used to describe the dress code like flippant or snooty.</li>
