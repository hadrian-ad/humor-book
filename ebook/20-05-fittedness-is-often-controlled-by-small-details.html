<p>Small details can make a big difference in how fitted a humor attempt is:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
   <blockquote>

        <p class="or">- OR -</p>

<p>Above, a small prelude <callback>(“you guys are so lucky”)</callback> sets up a comparison that helps Sam's audience feel humor family words&mdash;which gives Sam’s comment greater topical relevance and fittedness.</p> 

<p>Small differences can make a large difference in fittedness. We can use a quantification metaphor to graph the difference in fittedness:</p>
