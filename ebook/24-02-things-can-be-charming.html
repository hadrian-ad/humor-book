<p>We can find anything charming. It's not just people we ca feel frequent, fitted humor around&mdash;but also:</p> 
  
<ul class="close-list">
     <li>events</li>
      <li>festivals</li>

      </ul>
   
   <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
  <p>These things can have a charm-quality, since they tilt us toward humor outcomes.</p>
      
<p>We find all kinds of things charming:</p>

    <p>We feel humor from these things for the same reason we've seen throughout this book. When we encounter them, we:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list">
       <li>shift our evaluations of mistakes and OK into balance</li>
        
        <li>have opportunity and reason to <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, feel <humor-tell>optimistic</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>lose situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on</li>
        
        <li>feel <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on</li>
        
        <li>are able to <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>feel an argument has support</humor-outcome>, and so on</li>
        </ul>

    <p>In this book, when this happens many time in association with something, we describe that thing as charming.</p>

            We said that fitted humor is socially effective and connective. That's why charming people seem socially effective and connective&mdash;it's their skill at fitted humor.</p> 
            
             
            <p>Of course, the same is true not just of <term>people</term>, but of <term2>anything</term2>&mdash;places or events included. If everyone smiles whenever we gather around freshly baked cookies, the cookies and the baker will <em>also</em> seem socially effective.</p>
            
              <p>It's why we can also feel cookies, nurseries, baseball stadiums, and so on are agents of social cohesion, just like charming people.</p> </aside>

         <p><b>Comedic things.</b> In the same way a <term>festival</term> may be <term>charming</term> <callback>(making constant charm attempts)</callback>, a <term2>show</term2> may be <term2>comedic</term2> <callback>(making constant comedy attempts)</callback>.</p> 
           
             <p>Comedic things might be funny sound effects <callback>(“sproooinng-ng-ng-ng!!”)</callback>, trampolines, oversized bouncy balls, penguins, farts and so on, which have an association with prioritizing intensity of humor, not fittedness.</p>

 <!--
 <p>While <term>people</term> can react to our current evaluations and active topics, <term2>static objects</term2> can't&mdash;which is why comedic or charming things are somewhat brittle in their emotional outcomes.</p>
 -->
            
    <!--    
         <p>We have a few ways of approaching these things. The first is by <term>intention</term> <callback>(someone intends humor by farting, whether or not anyone laughs)</callback>, where we focus on the humor <sem-weak>attempt</sem-weak>, and any humor that may or may not be generated. The second is by the emotion <term2>generated</term2>, without considering the intention <callback>(someone laughs at a fart, whether or not anyone intended laughter)</callback>.</p>

        <p>A person can adjust to our current evaluations and active topics, but a static object can't. A new metaphor printed on a sign may be charming at first&mdash;but with enough exposure, we'll find it cliche or stale instead. And the sign can't adjust like a person to callibrate to us.</p>
        
        <p>Other things may be a bit more flexible. Often, an event or festival is like a very big charm attempt&mdash;and the organizers adjust it each time to fit the  attendees, so that many people consistently find it charming.</p>
