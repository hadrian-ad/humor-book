    <h3 id="24-02">Things can be charming</h3>   

<p>We can find <sem-weak>anything</sem-weak> charming, not just people. We can feel frequent, fitted humor around:</p> 
  
<ul class="close-list">
     <li>events</li>
      <li>festivals</li>
      <li>flowers</li>
      <li>metaphors</li>
      <li>packaging</li>
      <li>places</li>
       <li>sound effects</li>
      <li>typography</li>
      <li>user interfaces</li>
      <li>walks</li>
      </ul>
   
   <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
  <p>These things can have a charm-quality, since they tilt us toward humor outcomes.</p>

    <p>We feel humor from these things for the same reason we've seen throughout this book. When we encounter them, we:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list">
       <li>shift our evaluations of mistakes and OK into balance</li>
        
        <li>have opportunity and reason to <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, feel <humor-tell>optimistic</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>lose situational awareness</humor-tell>, and so on</li>
        
        <li>feel <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on</li>
        
        <li>are able to <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>feel an argument has support</humor-outcome>, and so on</li>
        </ul>

    <p>When this happens many times  in association with something <callback>(cookies, a nursury, a baseball stadium, a lak, a greenhouse)</callback>, or happens for a long time due to the <a href="5-0-duration.html">integration of our expectations</a>&mdash;we describe those things as charming.</p>  
            
<div class="consider">
              <aside class="consider">
              <consider>Consider:</consider>
               
            <p>
            We said that fitted humor is socially effective and connective. That's why charming people seem socially effective and connective&mdash;it's their skill at fitted humor.</p> 
            
             
            <p>Of course, the same is true not just of <term>people</term>, but of <term2>anything</term2>&mdash;places or events included. If everyone smiles whenever we gather around freshly baked cookies, baker as well as the <em>cookies</em> will seem socially effective.</p>
            
              <p>It's why we can also feel cookies, nurseries, baseball stadiums, and so on are agents of social cohesion, just like we feel charming people are.</p> </aside>

            <aside class="box">
         <p><b>Integrated.</b> We previously talked about how some expectations become integrated&mdash;when something deviates from <em>integrated</em> expectations, it takes a long time for our expectations to adjust.</p> 
         
         <p>People or things that can make us feel fitted humor on topics with integrated expectations are often seen as charming&mdash;as this creates a large amount of fitted humor.</p>
        
        <p>If Zoe spends a lot of her time in a city with lots of concrete and asphalt, going into an urban nursery will be a charming experience. If we're used to thinking of us as bad at something, an unexpected genuine compliment will be a charming experience.</p>

             <p>Comedic things might be funny sound effects <callback>(“sproooinng-ng-ng-ng!!”)</callback>, trampolines, oversized bouncy balls, penguins, farts and so on, which have an association with prioritizing intensity of humor, not fittedness.</p>
         </aside>-->
 <!--
 <p>While <term>people</term> can react to our current evaluations and active topics, <term2>static objects</term2> can't&mdash;which is why comedic or charming things are somewhat brittle in their emotional outcomes.</p>
 -->
            
    <!--    
         <p>We have a few ways of approaching these things. The first is by <term>intention</term> <callback>(someone intends humor by farting, whether or not anyone laughs)</callback>, where we focus on the humor <sem-weak>attempt</sem-weak>, and any humor that may or may not be generated. The second is by the emotion <term2>generated</term2>, without considering the intention <callback>(someone laughs at a fart, whether or not anyone intended laughter)</callback>.</p>

       <consider>Consider:</consider>
       
        <p>A person can adjust to our current evaluations and active topics, but a static object can't. A new metaphor printed on a sign may be charming at first&mdash;but with enough exposure, we'll find it cliche or stale instead. And the sign can't adjust like a person to callibrate to us.</p>
        
        <p>Other things may be a bit more flexible. Often, an event or festival is like a very big charm attempt&mdash;and the organizers adjust it each time to fit the  attendees, so that many people consistently find it charming.</p>
