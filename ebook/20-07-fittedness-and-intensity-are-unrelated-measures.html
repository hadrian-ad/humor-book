    <p><headline>Independence.</headline> Fittedness isn't related to intensity. While Hana feels roughly the same <term>intensity</term> of <term>humor</term> in each example, the <term2>fittedness</term2> of the <term2>humor attempt</term2> varied.</p>  

    <p>That's because fittedness and intensity are two different measures, which can change independent of each other.</p>
    
    </div> 
-->

<p>In the same way we can visually represent fittedness:</p>
 
 <img src=../images/18c-images-fittedness/16-13-fittedness-and-intensity-are-unrelated-measures/16-13-0-fittedness.png

    alt="A circle has lines coming off it, which are labeled fittedness.";
    title="Visual representation";
    style="max-width: 9rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>We can visually represent intensity:</p>


 <img src=../images/18c-images-fittedness/16-13-fittedness-and-intensity-are-unrelated-measures/16-13-1-intensity.png

    alt="A circle has underlines underneath, which are labeled intensity.";
    title="Visual representation";
    style="max-width: 7rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>We can visualize them together:</p>


 <img src=../images/18c-images-fittedness/16-13-fittedness-and-intensity-are-unrelated-measures/16-13-2-fittedness-and-intensity-together.png

    alt="The two figures above are put together. A circle has both lines coming off of it, labeled fittedness, and lines underneath, labeled intensity. ";
    title="Visual representation";
    style="max-width: 14rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>This lets us visually compare different humor felt at different humor attempts:</p>


 <img src=../images/18c-images-fittedness/16-13-fittedness-and-intensity-are-unrelated-measures/16-13-3-fittedness-and-intensity-together.png

    alt="This graph compares to humor attempt visualization, one for Jasper and another for Justin. Jasper has fewer lines coming off but more underlines than Justin, meaning his joke is more intense but less fitted relative to Justin's";
    title="Visual comparison";
    style="max-width: 17rem ; margin-left: " 
     >  

<aside class="box"><p><headline>Independence.</headline> Fittedness and intensity aren’t connected&mdash;they’re separate measures.</p> 
       
       <p>Below, we can see that one of Sam's anecdotes was <em>both</em> more fitted and generated more intense humor&mdash;one variation was better by both measures!</p>
            
       <img src=../images/18c-images-fittedness/16-13-fittedness-and-intensity-are-unrelated-measures/16-13-4-fittedness-and-intensity-case-study.png
        
            alt="This graph shows how one of Sam's variations has both more lines coming off of it while also having more underlines. It's both more intense and more fitted.";
            title="Visual comparison II";
            style="max-width: 18rem; margin-left: " 
             >
        
        <p>That's because fittedness and intensity are independent measures&mdash;knowing one in isolation doesn't tell us anything about the other.</p>

       <consider>For instance:</consider>
        
        <p>We don't think that size and cost are always dependent measures. Sometimes size and cost go hand-in-hand&mdash;but they don't always.</p> 
        
        <p>If someone says: "which is more expensive, a 1,200 square foot apartment or a 4,000 square foot apartment" we'd say we don't know&mdash;it depends on the location and quality of each.</p> 
        
        <p>In the same way, if someone says "which is more fitted, the joke that produced intense humor or the joke that didn't?" we'd say we don't know&mdash;we can't know fittedness from intensity, and vice versa.</p>
