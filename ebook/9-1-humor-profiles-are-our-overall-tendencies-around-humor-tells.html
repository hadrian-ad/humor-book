<p>Someone may have a specific way their cheek rises as they smile, or tend to hold their mouth open a certain way&mdash;all things that together make up someone's humor profile.</p>



<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Distinction.</headline> In the same way our faces, gaits, fingerprints, and so on are unique, our humor profiles are unique too&mdash;since everyone has a specific way of expressing humor that’s particular to them.</p> 
    
    <p>Our humor profile is part of our identity&mdash;it's something that makes us us.</p>
