Lack of humor marks lack of <emotions>comfort</emotions>
</h3>
  
<p>
    We feel humor when we feel <emotions>comfort</emotions>. But if we’re not aware that we’re comfortable, we won’t feel humor:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p> 
            <narration>Riley spends all day in front of the TV while Jennifer’s on vacation. She lies on the sofa, utterly relaxed, and transfixed by her tablet and the rainy window, mouth open and blank-faced.</narration>
        
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Sam:</speaker> <speech>“Are you just going to lie there all day?”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Riley:</speaker> <speech>“Uh-huh.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Riley doesn’t notice something comfortable&harr;&#xFE0E;no mistake means can't be balanced by an OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>
	When Riley <term>first</term> jumps on the couch, she may have felt <emotions>comfort</emotions>. But she eventually <term2>stops</term2> feeling <emotions>comfort</emotions>&mdash;the experience of being on the sofa takes on perceptual camouflage and becomes progressively unnoticeable to Riley.
</p>
<p>
	It won’t be until something changes&mdash;like she gets off the sofa or changes position&mdash;that she’s be able to notice things again. 
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>
            When Riley first jumps on the sofa, she has an active topic where she evaluates mistake and OK as balancing&mdash;she feels
            
                <emotions>comfort.</emotions>
            
            But eventually, she acclimates to the mistake, and the topic stops generating humor.</p>
            
             <p>Eventually, the topic becomes inactive, and so <em>can't</em> generate humor: 
        </p>
        
            <img class="img-indent"
            src="../images/7c-images-humor-family-words/7-5-we-will-not-feel-comfort-we-don't-notice/7-5-0-topics.png"
            title="Focus diagram"
            alt="This focus diagram has two columns, with the first being for the topic 'couch.' When the focus is on column 1 'couch,' an annotation says the topic is active, and can generate emotion. When the focus is not on column 1, the annotation says the topic is inactive and can't generate emotions."
            style="max-width:23rem;">
        
        <p>
            At that point, Riley isn't evaluating this topic for the same reason she's not evaluating topics related to her being safe, short, young, Pennsylvanian, able to run, the fact that she could one day walk on Mars, and so on.</p> 
            
            <p>Even though those are all true, she simply has no reason to be evaluating these things&mdash;those topics are inactive or uncreated. 
        </p>
    </aside>
</div>
<p>
	This is also why Riley will easily feel
	
		<emotions>comfort</emotions>
	
    when she goes to a friend’s house:</p>
	
	 <div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <speaker>Sam:</speaker> <speech>“Ready to leave, Riley? How was your time with Maddie?”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Riley:</speaker> <action>*heading out the door*</action> <speech>“Maddie has a beanbag! It was so comfortable!! Why isn’t our house comfortable?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Riley notices something comfortable, and so experiences it vividly)</notes>	
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*getting into car*</action> <speech>“Our house is comfortable, sweetheart! We have a sofa, chair, beds, swing…”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam doesn’t understand why Riley feels <emotions-in-notes>comfort</emotions-in-notes> at  Maddie's house, but not theirs)</notes>	
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Riley:</speaker> <speech>“I felt so comfortable at Maddie’s, I could have spent all day in her chair!”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Sam:</speaker> <internalaction>(vaguely annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“But you spend all day on the sofa at home!”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speaker>Riley:</speaker> <speech>“It’s not the same.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Riley has perceptual camouflage on chairs at home)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>
    </div>

	  
	    <p>Since nothing at Maddie's house has perceptual camouflage, Riley will experience everything vividly.
</p>
    
<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Camouflaged emotions.</b> The things we expect accrue <a href="5-6-dl-senses.html">perceptual camouflage</a>. This happens with our <term>senses</term>, like how we eventually stop noticing the sounds from the nearby highway&mdash;but it also happens with our <term2>emotions</term2>
                            
                            too.</p>
        <p>
             This is like when we're:
        </p>
        <ul class="close-list">
            <li>
                stressed for an entire year and aren't really aware of it&mdash;until we take a weekend to go do nothing in a cabin.
            </li>
            <li>
                employed for horrible work that we despise at first&mdash;but soon become numb to it.
            </li>
            <li>
                sad for so long that we don't notice&mdash;until we suddenly start sobbing for no reason.
            </li>
            <li>
                satisfied for so long we stop noticing it&mdash;until we try chasing greener pastures and realize what we lost.
            </li>
            <li>
                angry all the time&mdash;until it eventually just seems the normal way we are.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="and-so-on">
            (and so on)
            
        </p>
        <p>
            The more consistent our emotional state has been, the harder it is to reflect on it. This happened on a smaller scale with Riley, where the same amount of physical comfort became harder and harder to notice.
