<p>When Xiaowei rushes the tripwires, the high-velocity catches Heather off-guard, letting Xiaowei reach a humor outcome and feel humor.</p>

<p>By contrast, when Xiawei focuses more on constructing a conventional joke than he focused on <humor-outcome>avoiding conflict</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>, he didn't achieve enough velocity to affect the situation.</p>

           This doesn’t mean a lighter push of some kind by Xiaowei <em>couldn’t</em> have worked—or that the harder push worked in a strategic sense. Instead, we're looking at why Xiaowei's intuition might have led him to make a sharper comment.</p>

    <aside class="box"><p><headline>Need.</headline> When we're hanging out with our friend, we may not need much velocity to reach humor outcomes. They won't be guarding their tripwires, and will interpret our comments clearly and charitably. </p>
            
            <p>This is one reason our spontaneous whims or free-associations may reach all kinds of humor outcomes with our friend, in away it wouldn't with others.</p>  </aside>
