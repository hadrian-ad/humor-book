    <p>In the same way people react negatively to an unfitted <term>excess</term> of humor tells, people also react negatively to an unfitted <term2>absence</term2> of humor tells:</p>

<p>In the above examples, it wasn't the <term>presence</term> of humor that was unfitted, but its <term2>absence</term2>. The intensity of humor is seen as fitted within a low and high range.</p>
