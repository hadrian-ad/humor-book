    <p>Last chapter we talked about <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-00-dress-codes.html">humor dress codes</a>. In this chapter, we'll look at the relation between humor dress codes and <vocab>censure</vocab>.</p>
   
    <p>When we feel humor or a humor attempt is below dress code, we can censure them. We do this by not synchronizing with them:</p>

       <p>Above, the evaluatory disagreement is registered as censure.</p>
       
<div class="consider">
           <consider>Consider:</consider>
            <p>When we share an evaluatory perspective <callback>(synchronized)</callback>, we feel grouped. When we don't share an evaluatory perspective, we feel tension weakening our grouping&mdash;which is why we feel desynchronization as censure.</p>
            
            <p>This is why if we enthusiastically suggest something, and people aren't as excited, we'll feel we've been censured&mdash;because we experience desynchronization as censure.</p>

       <p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter</p>



<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Inclusive definitions.</headline> When we think of censure, we often think of room-stopping conflict and formal statements. <term>Sometimes</term> censure happens like social  dynamite&mdash;but <term2>most</term2> of the time, censure isn't a big deal to anyone.
    
         <p>In this book, censure is more often than not just a half-smile that contrasts with someone's full smile&mdash;something everyone does to everyone, including among us and our friends and family, in ways we think of as neither good nor bad, but just how things work.</p>
