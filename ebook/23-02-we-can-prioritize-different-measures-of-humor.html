    <h3 id="23-02">Charm is when the priority is fittedness</h3>   
    

<p>When judging humor, we can judge mostly by intensity <em>or</em> mostly by fittedness.</p> 
      
      <p>Judging by <term>intensity</term> we'll call <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;and judging by <term2>fittedness</term2> we'll call <vocab>charm</vocab>.</p>

<p>Having two measures for humor lets us compare humor or humor attempts in different ways:</p>

    
<ol>
   <li>Since <strong>comedy</strong> prioritizes a measure of <term>intensity</term>, the more intense the humor, the better the comedy. So if we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more intensity is better comedy.</li>
   
    <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-01-we-can-prioritize-different-measures/18-01-0-worse-better-comedy.png

    alt="This image has two columns. One has a small circle with a single line underneath it. An annotation says 'less intensity.' The other column has a small circle with several lines underneath it, with an annotation saying 'more intensity.' One is labeled worse comedy compared to the other which is labled better comedy."

    style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left: 1rem;">
    
    <li>Since <strong>charm</strong> prioritizes a measure <term2>fittedness</term2>, the more fitted the humor, the better the charm. So if we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more fittedness is better charm.</li>
    </ol>
           
    <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-01-we-can-prioritize-different-measures/18-01-1-worse-better-charm.png

    alt="This image has two columns with integration figures in each. One has a small circle with a few lines attached, and says 'less fittedness' and the other has a small circle with many lines attached and says 'more fittedness.' The one with less fittedness is worse charm than the one with more fittedness, which is better charm."

<p>This lets us take two different humor attempts and compare them:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe gets a few paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“So you finally got your oil shop up and running, hey?”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;<outcome-contrast>higher</outcome-contrast> intensity, <outcome-contrast>lower</outcome-contrast> fittedness compared to next example)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Thanks Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;<outcome-contrast>lower</outcome-contrast> intensity, <outcome-contrast>higher</outcome-contrast> fittedness compared to previous example)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>Zoe felt humor in both examples above&mdash;so which humor attempt was “better?” There’s no single answer! It depends on whether we’re prioritizing fittedness or intensity.</p>

<img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-01-we-can-prioritize-different-measures/18-01-2-better-worse-comedy-charm.png

    alt="This image has two columns that combine both intensity lines and integration lines. One column for 'oil shop' comment has more intensity lines and less integration lines than the other column for 'so proud.' This makes the 'oil shop' comment better comedy but worse charm."
    title="Combining intensity and fittedness graphs I"
    style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left: 1rem ">

<p>If we’re focusing on the <term>intensity</term> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s <outcome-contrast>pun</outcome-contrast> was better. If we’re instead focusing on the <term2>fittedness</term2> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s <outcome-contrast>affirmation</outcome-contrast> was better.</p>

<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>Since Brad values being able to make his daughter feel humor, it's helpful for him to recognize that prioritizing <sem-weak>either</sem-weak> intensity or fittedness can lead to humor.</p> 
        
        <p>By realizing that an affirmation can lead to humor, just like a pun can, he has more options to make Zoe smile or laugh.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Better.</b> Sometimes, humor attempts are better at <sem-weak>both</sem-weak> measures:</p>
        
    
        <div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*to drama team*</action> <speech>“I remember when I was cast as the slug in my fifth-grade play about compost…”</speech> <action>*crowd chuckles*</action> <notes>(&larr;<outcome-contrast>lower</outcome-contrast> fittedness, <outcome-contrast>lower</outcome-contrast> intensity)</notes></p>
        
        <p class="or">- OR -</p>
        
         <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*to drama team*</action> <speech>“You guys are lucky you have so much talent&mdash;I remember when I was cast as the slug in our fifth-grade play about compost…”</speech> <action>*crowd laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;<outcome-contrast>higher</outcome-contrast> fittedness, <outcome-contrast>higher</outcome-contrast> intensity)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
        
    
    <p>Sam's small adjustment had higher fittedness <em>and</em> higher intensity of humor:</p> 
    
                <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-01-we-can-prioritize-different-measures/18-01-3-better-better-comedy-charm.png
        
    alt="This figure has two columns. The column with for the variation with a prelude has more integration and intensity lines than the version without. This is better comedy and better charm, with an annotion that says 'Sam's prelude makes this humor attempt better comedy and better charm."
    title="Combining intensity and fittedness graphs II"
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: ">
    
    <p>In this case, no matter which measure we were prioritizing, one option was better. One was better comedy <em>and</em> better charm.</p>

    <p>
    What makes a fable different than other kinds of behavioral instruction is a threshold of fitted humor. Fitted humor is one part of how we intuitively  recognize something as a "fable" or not.
    </p>
</div>

  <p>This is different than a joke, where a better delivered joke is one that foremost generates more intense humor <callback>(comedy)</callback>, with the fittedness of secondary importance.</p>
