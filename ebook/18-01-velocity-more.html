The other graph is labeled 'lighter push toward a humor outcome,' with a situational ball with a smaller vector arrow labeled 'being indirect.' The ball's path bounces between a few barries on its way to the tripwire, with the barriers labeled 'am I understanding this right?'";

       <p>
           <headline>Ambiguity and scope.</headline> We rush tripwires by minimizing interpretive ambiguity and scope of reaction&mdash;like if we want to borrow someone's car for a weekend and say: <callback>"Can I borrow your car this weekend?"</callback></p> 
           
           <p>They can't pretend to not understand us&mdash;they'll have to say yes or no, or give a loaded maybe. We've put velocity on the request by minimizing ambiguity and their scope of reaction.</p>
           
          <p>By contrast, if we're indirect <callback>("I have to go home next weekend, and I haven't figured out how I'll get there yet")</callback>, they'll have a much easier time finding ambiguity in what we're asking <callback>(advice? small talk? request for assistance? commiseration?)</callback>&mdash;and they'll have a variety of ways they could respond.  </p>
          
          <p>
              In the same way we know how velocity works with <term>requests</term>, but it's the same for <term2>humor tripwires</term2>.
