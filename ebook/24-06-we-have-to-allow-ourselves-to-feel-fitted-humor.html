    <h3 id="24-06">Charmingness is often a two-way street</h3>   
    
 
<p>To be charming, it’s not enough to make <term>others</term> feel fitted humor&mdash;we have to allow <term2>ourselves</term2> to feel fitted humor too.</p>

<p>Zoe’s goal isn’t to make Sara feel humor while guarding against herself feeling humor. Instead, when Sara tries to be charming in Return, Zoe has to <em>also</em> express humor.</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sara sets her backpack down and admires Zoe’s plants.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <speech>“You’ve always done such a good job with your plants. I can barely keep that succulent you gave me alive, let alone look after twenty pots!”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*embarrassed*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> allow herself to feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe <outcome-contrast>declines</outcome-contrast> charm&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <internalaction>(deflecting)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh, it’s not a big deal, they’re just plants.”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe allows herself to feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe accepts charm&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <internalaction>(deflecting)</internalaction> <speech>“Well. Thanks! It’s not that big a deal after a while, they’re just plants.”</speech></p>
    
     
    
    
    
</div>


<p>Over time, <em>mutual</em> fitted humor allows for <em>mutual</em> feelings of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mdash;which accomplishes Zoe’s goal of mutually renewing their friendship.</p>

<p>This is why Zoe defaults to prioritizing <term>fittedness</term> instead of <term2>intensity</term2>. Fittedness is more in-line than her long-term objectives than intensity is by itself.</p>

 

 <aside class="box">
     <p><b>Default.</b> Sometimes we default to <term>comedy</term> attempts&mdash;like if we've taken up jester or class clown roles, or develop a habit of undercutting moments of <emotions>connection</emotions> or <emotions>delight</emotions> with a comedy attempt.</p> 
     
     <p>When comedy is our default, we can run into awkward moments, hurt others, struggle to develop close connections with others, and so on. </p>
     
      
       <p>That's why we usually have the best outcomes when we default to <term2>charm</term2> attempts, since fitted humor is what allows us to have functioning and enjoyable experiences with each other. It allows us to develop reflexes that go toward generating mutually felt <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
     
     <p>Defaulting to charm doesn't mean we give up  comedy attempts&mdash;it just means we don't reflexively make them. This gives us the space to pick and choose when we make comedy attempts, using them purposefully instead of indiscriminately.</p>
