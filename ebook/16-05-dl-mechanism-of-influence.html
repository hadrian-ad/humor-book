    <p>In this book, humor is the <em>only</em> way to reach a humor outcome. For instance, the <em>only</em> way to <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>is with humor&mdash;<humor-outcome>controlling a situation</humor-outcome> <em>requires</em> humor.</p>

<p>In this book, <em>humor</em> outcomes are the subset of evaluatory outcomes that happen concordantly.</p> 
   
 <p>That means humor is how we <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>reveal a personal review (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
   
   <div class="consider">
     <aside class="consider">
         <consider>Consider:</consider>
         <p>Note that in the same way we can have mixed emotional states <callback>(anger <em>and</em> humor)</callback>, there's nothing odd about various combinations of influences&mdash;like an experience that mingles concord with coercion.</p>
     </aside>
 </div>
 
    
<p>Humor is the <em>mechanism</em> of concordant influence&mdash;something so foundational to our experiences, it's hard to even notice. It's like breathing!</p> 
         
<p>   It's easiest to notice when we think about situations that <sem-weak>require</sem-weak> concord&mdash;like making friends, creating romantic relationships, asking someone to help us, motivating volunteers, organizing strangers, and so on.</p> 
    
  <p>We <sem-weak>could</sem-weak> pull a gun or pay money to <sem-weak>make</sem-weak> someone do something <callback>(coercive influence)</callback>&mdash;but we can't make someone <em>want</em> to do those things <callback>(concordant influence)</callback>.</p> 
            

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
         <consider>Consider:</consider>   
        <p>If we pull a gun to make someone be our friend, they'll want to not get shot more than they want to be our friend.</p> 
                     
        <p>A similar twist often happens when we offer people money&mdash;they want money and not what the money influences them do.</p>
    </aside> </div>
                  
                   
<p>If someone wants to transition a relationship to a romantic one, they can't get what they want by sitting around or threatening them with lawsuits. That's because what makes a romantic relationship meaningful is the fact that two people want the same thing <callback>(concord)</callback>.</p> 
    
    
<p>It's concord, not coercion or inertia, which creates what's wanted from romantic relationships. So the only route to what we <sem-weak>really</sem-weak> want is through humor. We want to <em>concordantly</em> <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tensions</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>help each other feel accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open up new topics of conversations</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>We want the same thing everywhere. All things being equal, we'd rather there be concord than not&mdash;with our children, coworkers, friends, municipal government, teams, and so on.</p> 
        
        <p>Without concord, we often only have the picture of what we want only.</p>
</aside>  
     </div>        
    
   
             
    <p>It's concordant influence that makes someone <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to be our friend, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to be at our birthday party, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to volunteer, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to care for mutual space, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to do us a favor, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to reconcile with us, and so on.</p> 
     
     
     <p>It's the same for what motivates us. When we have a genuine, shared smile with someone&mdash;we <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to do things with or for each other.</p> 
      
<p>When multiple people feel humor for the same reason, the alignment of evaluations is an expression of concord.</p> 
       
<p>This gives some context for what we've been talking about throughout this book: humor is the mechanism of concordant influence. Humor is the power that drives internal changes. The way this happens&mdash;outside of coercion or inertia&mdash;is through humor.</p>

        Similarly, there's nothing odd about drawing lines around where there's concord and where there's not. If our team laughs and they don't, there's concord if we just look at our team, and a lack of concord if we look at both teams. We can do the same thing with just two people. If one person laughs and the other doesn't, there's internal concord just looking at one person, but only one-sided concord looking at both people.

    <p>The library recognizes an unusual risk, so they decide to put up warning signs. However, due to the unusualness of the risk, they decide they need to actually <humor-outcome>support the argument (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>, not just give an unspecificed "warning" sign.</p> 
    
    <p>Once we recognize that the goal <callback>("<humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>")</callback>is a humor outcome, we can recognize creating this sign is a humor task.</p>
    
    <p>The sign-makers decided to focus on reaching the reaching the humor outcome directly <callback>(outcome-first approach)</callback>. Once they decide this, they don't need to think about "humor" at all&mdash;no need for jokes, comics, cartoon characters, self-reference, or other things stereotypically thought of as "funny."</p>
    
    <p>They instead just focus their efforts on <humor-outcome>supporting an argument.</humor-outcome> <callback>("If our argument is supported, they'll feel humor.")</callback>

    <p>This means they focus foremost on presenting a compelling argument. They laid out the reasons for caution, with an implied negative consequences if caution isn't exercised.</p>

    <p>The transit company above wanted to <humor-outcome>support an argument  (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. To reach this humor outcome, they could have focused making a strong argument for caution <callback>(outcome-first: "if they feel our argument is supported, they'll feel humor")</callback>. But instead, they used a cartoony allegory to try to balance mistakes and OK <callback>(emotion-first: "if they feel humor, they'll feel our argument is supported")</callback>.</p>
    
    <p>How did they decide between these methods? They thought about their target audience and how people would use their sign. They knew people may not spend much time looking at this sign, so they wanted to avoid long text or complicated visuals to support their argument. They also knew that not all the people they're trying to reach can read Turkish. So they decide on something visual that can be interpreted fairly quickly.</p>
    
    <p>This led them to decide on an emotion-first method&mdash;when planning out this sign, they focus first on balancing mistakes and OKs, without bothering to think about expectations and sense of security in terms of <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> they think about how to deviate from someone's expectations&mdash;which they do by showing a bumbling figure carelessly skipping toward an ambushing Death.</li> 
        
        <li><strong>OK:</strong> This is balanced by using an abstract and cartoonish style, leaving consequences implied in the future. Our disassociation from the character and outcome lets us feel more secure from negative personal consequences.</li>  
        </ul>
    <p>The designers have to callibrate mistakes and OKs based on their audience. For instance, they can make the sign more or less like other warning signs to modulate the mistake&mdash;or make the drawing more or less realistic to modulate the OK. If the audience feels humor generated by a relevant topic, they'll have <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome> and accomplished their goal.</p>

<p>Task: A church wants to prevent cars cutting through their parking lot. So they decide to make a sign to that effect. How do they go about making an effective sign?</p>
            
<p>They start by thinking about they want their sign to achieve: they want to <humor-outcome>control/influence situations (by making drivers voluntarily stop cutting through)</humor-outcome>. In other words, the church wants their sign to generate humor.</p>

<p>They think about the most obvious sign they could think of <callback>("no cutting through")</callback>&mdash;and decide this probably wouldn't generate humor in a way that influenced a situation as much as they would like.</p> 

<p>So they think about using an outcome-first method of design. They brainstorm some of the most obvious ways to rush humor outcome tripwires&mdash;like by listing stats to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>; using a graphic of elderly or young church goers to <humor-outcome>share a perspective</humor-outcome>; bonding with readers by <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome><callback> ("hey, good neighbor!&mdash;please don't cut through")</callback>; and so on.</p> 

<p>They evaluate these approaches for suitability. Most of them have drawbacks: graphics are expensive to commission; stats take space to present effectively (especially to people in cars who are distant and fast-moving); elaborate sentences take time to read (which drivers don't always have); and so on.</p>

<p>So they set aside outcome-first methods, and brainstorm emotion-first methods. They take their standard idea <callback>("no cutting through")</callback> and think about how they could make it deviate from people's expectations. They think about adding colors, using an unusual shape or size, choosing an odd font, using odd phrasing; using slang; reverse psychology; and so on.</p>

<p>None of these emotion-first methods add much velocity toward a <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> tripwire. But they <em>do</em> have the advantage of meshing with the constraints of their sign.</p>

<p>So they pick a few of the emotion-first ideas that they thought were thematically relevant to the church. They use gothic script and archaic English to make a sign that says "Thou Shall Not Cut Through." They make an emotional forecast that many drivers would have balanced mistakes and OKs at this sign, which would reduce the rate of cutting through by <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>.
