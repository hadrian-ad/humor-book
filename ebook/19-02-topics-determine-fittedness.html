<p>Fittedness <term>increases</term> when humor or humor attempts have <term>relevant</term> <a href="../6chapter-topics/6-0-topics.html">topics</a>, and <term2>decreases</term2> when there's <term2>irrelevant</term2> topics:</p>

<p>We can order these three jokes by order from least to most fitted:</p>

    alt="All the previous integration figures are presented, with the least connected first and the most connected last. An annotation notes the last is most fitted."

<p>The one that followed up on recently relevant topics was most fitted. </p>

        <p>When something is more fitted, that doesn't mean it's the best option, funniest, most important, or so on&mdash;it just means it's most fitted.</p>

    <p><b>Focus.</b> It's the same process to find the fittedness of humor <callback>(an emotion)</callback> as it is to find the fittedness of a <a href="../15chapter-z-velocity/15-11-humor-attempts.html">humor attempt</a> <callback>(an action)</callback>.</p>  
    
    <p>Even if Hana never smiles in any of the examples above <callback>(humor attempts without humor)</callback>, we could still organize the humor attempts by fittedness.</p>
    
    <p>Similarly, even if Hana smiles at Artem without Artem knowing she's there <callback>(humor without humor attempts)</callback>, we could still organize her humor by fittedness&mdash;it's more fitted if she smiles because she recognizes him than because she thinks about cake.</p>
