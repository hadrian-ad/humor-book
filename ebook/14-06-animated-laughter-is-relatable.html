Laughter makes things emotionally vivid
</h3>


<p>We often find the most resonant parts of spectator entertainment to be scenes of characters laughing together:</p>

<p>Above, characters briefly balance mistakes and OKs, which allows them to feel mutual <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>This variety of humor family words, shared between two people, makes the scene feel emotionally rich to Owen. The way the characters share an evaluatory transition feels meaningful, coherent, relatable, and integrated.</p>

<consider>Consider:</consider>
                    
            
            <p>Owen appreciates this scene not because it says anything profound about addiction or other subjects&mdash;but because the shared laughter between the characters creates a more engaging emotional story.</p>
               
            <p>For instance, the emotional plot of this episode includes enemies becoming friends becoming enemies again. The intensity of this emotional plot partly relies on the quality of their shared humor in this moment.</p>

    <p>Since it's hard for live-action characters to laugh convincingly on-screen, let alone laugh together&mdash;these emotionally resonant scenes tend to either be flat or absent from live-action media.</p>
    
    
<!--    
The Return of the King has a moment of shared laughter, but these are characters shown 
     
     
      One consequence of the difficulty of live action characters 
       
       having live-action characters laugh 
        Since it's easier to have animated characters laugh together, we more often experience this richness in animated shows than live

<p><b>Translation.</b> Laughter is one barrier to creating a live-action versions of various media. There's no physical way to do Homer Simpson's laugh in live-action!</p> 

               
<p>This ends up making many live adaptions of animation things feel flat compared to the original&mdash;since its the <sem-weak>laughing</sem-weak> that provides a lot of the depth of emotional connection to the character.</p>
     
     <p>Note that this is true of any emotional expression&mdash;like crying, where random sounds can effectively be superimposed over animation without having to be particularly realistic.</p>

            In part because , live-action shows often focus around mistake-predominant emotions instead of humor, in part because they struggle to convincingly present nuanced, intense humor.
            
            It's harder to do scenes with shared laughter in live-action scenes than in animated scenes&mdash;not only do live-action actors have less leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laugh, but <em>then</em> have to do so convincingly on set and on camera!</p>

<p>We interpret the repetitive noises the voice actor is making as laughter&mdash;but it's not actually laughing, just repetitive random noises! (We can see this for ourselves by imitating Frink's laughter.)</p>

<p>In fact, almost any kind of repetitive noise we make could be superimposed over an animated character laughing, and be interpreted by others as laughing&mdash;even though it's actually just a random repetitive noise!</p>

<p>This kind of shared laughter is relatively harder to do well in live shows than animated shows. Voice actors have more leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laughs, which they can then do consistently. These laughs are often one of our strongest point of recall for them.</p>


<p>The presence of nuanced and varied laugh-like noises gives animated shows a feeling of emotional finesse and relatability that's often lacking in film.</p>

<p>For instance, in this clip two characters who were at first testy rivals have been forced to collaborate and develop mutual respect for each other. With a larger OK and understanding of each other, they share faults that generate large mistakes&mdash;generating humor. They feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>Since animated shows have an easier time displaying intensity, duration, and lean toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance, we experience them as having emotional depth. A live action show would struggle to convincingly display intense humor like this, making the emotional activity feel flat. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Example #2 (Film):</button>
   
   <div class="content-example">

<p>We find distinctive spectator laughs to be memorable and relatable, whether in film or animation. In this clip one character has a memorable, non-standard spectator laugh, while the other has a forgettable, standard spectator laugh:</p> 


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVXU6p2QaKU?si=S7DP0e7ojluw0AYg&amp;end=21" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>One one hand, the distinctive laugh is <term>familiar</term> to our lives, since we hear distinctive laughs like this relatively frequently. On the other hand, it's <term2>unfamiliar</term2> to movies, since we rarely hear laughs like this from main characters that aren't part of an explicit gag. In the end, the unusual laugh makes the character relatable and memorable.
