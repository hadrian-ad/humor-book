<p>You finished the book! I want to congratulate you&mdash;you now know more about humor than almost anyone else alive, which is pretty neat! (That's not an exaggeration&mdash;you’ll probably start seeing humor illiteracy in others: the smiles that only you notice, the inconsistent meanings to words, the dropped explanations, the narrow focuses.)</p>

<p><book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> was an experimental textbook that was both exhilarating and exhausting to produce&mdash;the word passion means to <callback>“struggle and feel pain,”</callback> and that was certainly the case here.</p>

<p>It was certainly long in the womb&mdash;over six years of working, an effort of crazy synthesis from all my reading, my puzzling over shuttered dance halls, and work in community building in cafes and folk schools&mdash;and the long feeling that something, something BIG, wasn’t quite right in everything.</p>

<p>Where was the knowledge that would give us greater dignity, joy, and wisdom? I tried to find and then share the step-by-step chain of reasoning that I believed might not just constitute this knowledge, but contribute it to others as well.</p>

<p>That meant creating human-scaled instruction in the downplayed natural unit of a smile&mdash;the missing measurement that has caused much amazement to so many people. <callback>(Amazement: lost in a maze.)</callback></p>

<p>It’s my hope that, where it comes to humor, you feel your stance has improved&mdash;feet further apart, more stable-footed. If someone pushed you a bit, you'd have the footwork to push back a bit.</p>

<p>And perhaps you felt the seed of harmony between yourself and the ideas in this book&mdash;catalytic insight that will grow and grow as you create your own potent, self-sharpened variation of what was described in this book.</p>

<p>In my own journey, I found nothing about anything in this book obvious prior to writing it&mdash;in fact, I had to overcome my extreme skepticism and initial dismissal toward its ideas. My goal was to channel my memory of my skepticism into a genuine pathway toward the gentle acceptance of many of its more dangerous ideas.</p>

<p>My intellectual inspiration to so many things, Warren Shibles, did not give gentle pathways toward anything. He wrote many, many books on subjects like humor, emotions, ethics, aesthetics, lies, time, metaphor, death, language, and so on. He had a simplicity of style that straddled stupid and profound, which caused much friction with other academics&mdash;and would casually drop world-challenging implications&mdash;disregard reader-amenable polish and performance to his books&mdash;and had an autistic tilt to his examples that gave everything an unfamiliar, almost alien lens.</p> 

<aside class="consider">
    <div class="consider">
           <p>
            One of Shible's books was called <book-title>Time: A Critical Analysis for Children</book-title>, a book that would have deeply scarred me as a child. It tried to demonstrated the non-existence of time as popularly understood via stick figures drawn in MS Paint and somewhat frightening  phrases like <callback>"it's banana o'clock!"</callback>
        </p>

</aside>

<p>I would read a few pages of his books and then stop and sulk for a week as I grappled with them. Eventually, I would digest them and stop sulking, and I’d read a bit more, and the process would repeat. </p>

<p>I encountered Shibles’ book on humor as a high schooler, which was the genesis to this book&mdash;and set me on a life of teaching and talking about humor.</p> 

<p>I am profoundly grateful that he self-published <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;something that inspired me to, twenty years later, to self-publish my own work, iterating on some of his themes. One of my goals was to stylize a book that could go deeper, produce less sulking, and quite a bit more wonder. </p>

<p>If you thought the depths of these ideas around humor have all been plumbed, I am here to say&mdash;the most interesting are yet to come. For practical reasons, including care of my readers, much has been left for Volume II. It’s my hope to put the drafts in good order&mdash;but of course who knows what the future brings.</p>

<p>I always feel that, when we pull back the blinds to look at humor, we’re letting in more light from the window&mdash;and feel that the whole thing may be vaster and more varied that we had thought, in ways we already knew, but had never really stopped to think about.</p>
