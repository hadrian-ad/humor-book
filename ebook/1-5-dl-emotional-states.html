            </h2>
     

     
     <p>
	We often notice humor mainly when it’s unambiguous&mdash;like when we’re laughing at a movie:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Emma and Owen are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title>.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>Chief is hired to work at a warehouse, but his attempt to move crates of lobsters goes horribly, horribly wrong. Emma and Owen laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;just <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>

    style="max-width: 17rem;">
       
<p>
	But even though we sometimes seem to feel “one” emotion, most emotions happen in a mix&mdash;like when Jennifer feels both humor and anger: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Jennifer looks up from her tablet. Where’s Riley? Her heart sinks in fear. She checks the street, then runs around the house.</narration></p> 
        
         <p><narration>She sees Riley squatting quietly next to an anthill, and Jennifer puts a hand over her heart and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
        <p>
        <speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <internalaction>(relieved)</internalaction> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Riley! Thank god. I thought I told you to stay the side yard.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>anger</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
        </p>

   style="max-width: 24rem;">

<p>
	We can see this in other examples as well:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor walks into class and trips, and the cereal he’s carrying falls down his shirt.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>At first shocked, his classmates see that he’s not hurt and start to laugh with relief.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>Trevor stands there, embarrassed, and laughs sheepishly. Red-faced, he goes to heads to the bathroom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>embarrassment</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>

    style="max-width: 18rem;">
	
<p>
	In complicated emotional states, a small amount of humor may mingle with feelings of anger, bitterness, disappointment, sadness, and so on:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Emma sadly shuts the door to her apartment.</narration></p>
