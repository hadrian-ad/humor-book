Humor family words and spectator entertainment

<p>We feel <a href="7-0-humor-family-words.html">humor family words</a> from spectator entertainment:</p>

<p>Above, Trevor and Duke are <term>synchronized</term>&mdash;they're both feeling <emotions>achievement</emotions> at the same time.</p> 
   
<div class="consider"><aside class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>
              <p>This makes it easy for us to think of Trevor's humor as humor family words, since we cue off the content of the movie.</p> </aside></div>
    
<p>But even when our emotional reactions are <term2>desynchronized</term2> with characters, we can still describe our humor with humor family words:</p>

<p>Since Lina and Xiaowei don't match emotions with Rosie, we might first be tempted to describe their humor as a feeling of <emotions>danger</emotions> <callback>(like Rosie is feeling)</callback>&mdash;but Lina and Xiaowei are actually feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>!</p>
      
<div class="consider"><aside class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
         <p>It's not surprising that  Lina and Xiaowei might feel <emotions>safety</emotions> watching someone <term>pretend</term> to be chased by a <term>fake</term> alien parasite&mdash;even though they'd feel <emotions>danger</emotions> if they were watching someone <term2>actually</term2> be chased by a <term2>real</term2> alien parasite.</p>

<p>Sometimes we read about hard work and wonder why it feels good&mdash;but Zoe isn't actually doing hard work. She's instead feeling <emotions>comfort</emotions> from the book. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback>

      <img class="img-indent"
       src="../images/12c-images-spectator-entertainment/12-6-humor-family-words-are-present/12-6-2-hard-work.sketchpad.png"
        title="Novel involving hard work"
alt="This interaction template shows the character and work horse on one side of the screen, and Zoe reading on the other. An annotation says it's not surprising that the emotional reactions on either end of the screen don't match."

<p>When we think about it, it's not surprising that <term>reading</term> about an experience has a different emotional outcome than actually <term2>experiencing</term2> it. They're completely different!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>We don't read about a feast and then wonder why we're still hungry. Even so, we sometimes read about something terrible and then wonder why we laugh!</p>
        
        <p>In the same way <book-title>reading</book-title> about a feast isn't feasting, reading about something terrible isn't suffering through it. </p>
    </aside>
    
    <!--
    
    <p>Even so, we sometimes see people ask things like <callback>"why does this terrible thing make me laugh?"</callback>&mdash;even when the more accurate question is <callback>"why does <em>reading</em> about this terrible thing make me laugh?"</callback>
    </p>
    
    <p>We can make that question answerable by first droppping the "terrible," and then replacing "laugh" with a humor family words: <callback>"Why does <outcome-contrast>reading</outcome-contrast> about this thing make me feel <emotions>safety</emotions> (<emotions>comfort, connection, relief,</emotions> or so on)?"</callback></p> 
    
    -->
</div>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p>When Trevor laughs after being scared while taking out the dog, and Lina and Xiaowei laugh after being scared while watching a horror movie&mdash;the shared experience was <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
    
    <p>This lets us avoid fixating on content. Instead of asking infinite <term>content</term> questions <callback>"why do we laugh at alien parasites?"</callback>, <callback>"why do we laugh after being spooked"</callback>, and so on&mdash;we can ask a <outcome-contrast>few</outcome-contrast> <term2>emotional</term2> question instead. <callback>("Why do we laugh at safety?")</callback></p> 
    </div>

<p>It's also not surprising that the surface content is sometimes unimportant. When Zoe <term>reads</term> a book that has hard work in it, she's not <term2>doing</term2> hard work. So the question isn't <callback>"why is hard work funny?"</callback>&mdash;it's actually <callback>"why is <strong>reading</strong> about hard work funny?"</callback></p> 

  
<p>Zoe isn't evaluating the abstract idea of "hard work." Instead, she's having a personal relation to the book's contrasts, contexts, presentation, and so on. It's these things that shift  Zoe's mistakes and OK into balance. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback></p>

   <aside class="box">
         <p><b>Wink and a nod.</b> We're sometimes surprised that so many movies advertised as "scary" aren't really scary&mdash;but we're only surprised if we're taking their advertising at face value.</p> 
          
        <p>So even though <book-title>Squeal IV</book-title> promotes itself as scary, its appeal to teenagers isn't actually <term>scariness</term>&mdash;it’s appeal is that it generates <term2>humor</term2>. Any scariness is just a means to an end: of feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
           
        <p>We know this for all kinds of reasons. If scariness alone was appealing, then children scared to their core by adult movies would enjoy the experience&mdash;but they don’t. Similarly, if goriness alone was appealing, then adults would love watching gory war footage&mdash;but they don't. 
        
        <p>That’s because neither scariness nor gore is the appeal of scary movies&mdash;the appeal is humor. This is why so many horror movies are campy and cliche. When humor <outcome-contrast>isn't</outcome-contrast> present, scariness and gore isn't appealing.</p>
        
        <p>If someone <em>doesn't</em> feel humor from jump scares, they'd rather do almost anything than watch movies built around them. Of course, even if they'd never watch them alone, they may watch them with friends if they think the film will allow them to together have emotional experiences of <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>
