        We don’t always think of humor as an emotion. But when we think about it, humor behaves just like any other emotion:

 Since humor behaves similarly to things like anger and sadness, we’ll be calling humor an emotion:</p> 
        
           <p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion</p>
        
 <p>We'll be going over this in the rest of this chapter.
    </p>


    

<aside class="box">
     <p><b>Demystifying humor.</b> Sometimes, without really thinking about it, we put humor into its own category:
      </p>
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-0-images/1-0-1-humor-excluded.png" title="Excluded humor" style="max-width: 18rem;"
      
      alt="This figure clusters emotions that we usually think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, and shame. Humor is put off to the side, as outside that cluster.">
      <p>
          Humor becomes mysterious and hard to think about when it's isolated from everything else. But humor becomes easier to think about when we put similar things together:
      </p>
      <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-0-images/1-0-2-humor-included.png"
      style="max-width: 11rem;"
      title="Included humor"
      
      alt="This figure evolves the previous diagram by including humor in the same cluster of what we typically think of as emotions, like anger, joy, sadness, shame."
      
      style="max-width: 13rem;">
      <p>
          By plugging humor into our existing understanding of emotions, we’ll have a greater intuitive understanding of humor.
