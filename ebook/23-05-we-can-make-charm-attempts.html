<p>Above, the people making humor attempts were prioritizing <em>fittedness</em>&mdash;so they were charm attempts. The intensity of humor didn't have priority of concern.</p>

       <p> When we  judge by or prioritize <term>fittedness</term>, that doesn't mean there <sem-weak>isn't</sem-weak> intense humor, or that intensity is unimportant. It just means intensity doesn't have <term2>priority</term2>.</p>
       
       
       <p>It's like when we decide we want to play a game with a good story. We wouldn't start by  looking for a game with good <term>graphics</term>. We'd start by looking for a game with a good <term2>story</term2>. Until that condition is met,  the graphics aren't relevant.</p>

    <p><b>Restaurantic.</b> Sometimes we think humor <em>is</em> comedy, and so we try to understand all humor in terms of being “comedic.” But that would be odd&mdash;a bit like thinking eating <em>is</em> restaurants, and then trying to understand all eating in terms of being “restaurantic.”</p>
    
    <p>That would be using something that came second <callback>(comedy/restaurants)</callback> to try to explain the much wider thing that came first <callback>(humor/eating)</callback>.</p>
