<h2 id="1-01">We'll pick just one meaning of humor</h2>
    
<p>Humor is a broad word in our day-to-day conversations, and we don't always use it to mean an emotion. At different times, we use the word "humor" to refer to a kind of:</p>
     
<ul class="close-list">
    <li><strong>comment</strong> <callback>(compliment, insult, <strong>humor</strong>, question, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>genre</strong> <callback>(drama, horror, <strong>humor</strong>, thriller, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>personality trait</strong> <callback>(gentleness, <strong>humor</strong>, temper, thoughtfulness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>quality</strong> <callback>(aggressive, beauty, <strong>humor</strong>, meanness, persuasiveness, and so on)</callback></li>
    <li><strong>emotion</strong> <callback>(anger, <strong>humor</strong>, listlessness, sadness, and so on)</callback></li></ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>We see this fluidity of meaning all the time:</p>
    <div class="vignette">
       <blockquote>
           <p><narration>Zoe and Emma do a double take on a joke scribbled on a white board.</narration></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><speaker>Amber:</speaker> <action>*to clerk*</action> <speech>“Hey, excuse me, I’m looking for the new Gram Bridgette book&mdash;is that in the memoir or the humor section?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;“humor” as a genre)</notes></p>
    </blockquote></div>

    <div class="vignette">

    <p>Sometimes, the broadness of the word "humor" can be a source of utility and rich meaning. But other times, it can lead to confusion.</p> 
        
  <p>In this book, we'll reduce potential confusion by <em>only</em> using "humor" to refer to an emotion in this book.

            <p>There’s nothing wrong with other ways we use humor. But in a book like this, it can be wrong to be <sem-weak>inconsistent</sem-weak> in how we use the word humor.</p> 
            
            <p>To avoid meaning one thing by "humor" in one sentence, and another thing the next, we'll stick to a single lane for "humor."</p>  </aside>
