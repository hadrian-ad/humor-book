Topics help think about long timescales
</h3>
  
<p>
	We can also use topics to think about humor on a longer timescale than we usually do&mdash;like the humor we feel days after we hear a joke:

	Elias doesn't feel much humor when he <term>first</term> hears the jokes. But the jokes were required for a <term>later</term> moment of humor. 
</p>
<p>
	So there's a relevant <term2>short</term2> timescale <callback>(something Elias observes, which is immediately followed by humor)</callback> and a relevant <term2>long</term2> timescale <callback>(something that laid the groundwork for Elias' present humor)</callback>.

        <p>We sometimes think of humor as something that happens primarily on a <term>short</term> timescale, like a few seconds&mdash;like someone tells us a joke, and then we laugh.</p>
        
        <p>But to fully understand humor, we also need to be able to think about a <term2>long</term2> timescale too, including days, weeks, years, and so on.</p>

         <p><b>Agency and calibration.</b> When Elias was spoon-fed wordplay, he  didn’t always have the situational flexibility to balance his mistakes and OKs.</p>
            
            <p>But when he was dynamically interacting with the world, he <em>did</em> have the flexibility to generate humor. He had the agency to balance his evaluations and generate humor.</p>
            
        <p>We experience this all the time. Watching an unfunny comedy in a <term>movie theater</term> can feel like a brittle experience&mdash;it's either funny or it's not. If we're not feeling much humor in a movie theater, there's not much we can do about it.</p>
            
        <p>But when we watch an unfunny comedy at <term2>home</term2>, we have more agency&mdash; we can adapt and generate humor no matter what. We do this by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="indepth">
                talking during dull parts
            </li>
            <li class="indepth">
                venting via text
            </li>
            <li class="indepth">
                mocking characters
            </li>
            <li class="indepth">
                supplementing flat humor with our own commentary
            </li>
            <li class="indepth">
                exclaiming together
            </li>
            <li class="indepth">
                ordering pizza

        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
        
        <p>The same way flexibility lets us tailor humor out of a <term>movie</term>, flexibility lets us tailor humor out of <term2>any</term2> experience.</p>
