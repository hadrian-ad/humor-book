<p>All social animals feel humor. At first, it can seem weird to say "animals feel humor" outright, without any hedging&mdash;but it's only weird if we think that humor is about jokes, satire, wit, resolving existential tension through art, and so on.</p> 

<p>While it's true that other animals don’t appreciate puns in comedic movies like we do&mdash;that doesn't mean they don't feel humor.
   
    <p>After all, <sem-weak>babies</sem-weak> can’t appreciate comedic movies either&mdash;but we still say they feel humor <callback>(they smile and laugh)</callback>. That's because we intuitively know that humor is something separate from verbal language&mdash;like how a baby can feel humor, even though no five-month-old has ever written a script or made a witty comment.</p>


<p>Our model of humor applies fairly well to non-human animals:</p>



<h5>Mistakes and OKs</h5> 
 
<p>Animals feel humor when the size of their mistakes and OKs balance. When those don’t balance, they feel mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotions instead:</p>

    <div class="vignette">
       <blockquote>

            </p>

<p>We see similar things with any social animal:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>apes investigate things</li>
    <li>bear cubs wrestle with each other</li>
    <li>cats play with mice</li>
    <li>crows try to pull animal tails</li>
    <li>dogs see people return early</li>
    <li>dolphins explore novelty</li>
    <li>elephants perform pranks</li>
    <li>fawns explore fields</li>
    <li>monkeys observe behavior</li>
    <li>otters push things around</li>
    <li>parrots are mischievous</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 


<p>In all these cases, other animals have the same forking outcomes we do: sometimes the mistake is too large, and they become defensive&mdash;other times the OK is too large, and they get bored. When the mistake and OK balance, they feel humor.</p>

 

<h5>Generating humor</h5> 
 
<p>Animals intentionally try to generate humor&mdash;we already have words for this, like “play.” An animal that’s playing is intentionally enlarging mistakes or shrinking an OK to generate humor.</p>

 

<div class="for-instance">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>For instance:</consider>
        <p>When fawns have a large OK, they’ll prance to create large mistake and generate humor. Cats will intentionally generate humor by playing with mice or string. “Playing” is a context-specific word for trying to generate humor.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>Like in humans, humor in other animals indicates the Goldilocks experiential zone&mdash;not too much mistake, not too much OK. When intentionally pursued <callback>("play")</callback>, it’s the sweet spot where we’re pushing something while also mitigating risk. Humor is part of how we communicate our relation to this sweet spot to others.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
 
 <aside class="consider">
     <consider>For instance:</consider>
     
     <p>When bear cubs, dog puppies, or human kids wrestle, they’ll use humor to calibrate themselves into this Goldilocks zone. Too much mistake, and they’ll slow up. Too much OK, they’ll go a bit harder. Their emotion network helps them arrive at the place between too consequential and not consequential enough&mdash;which is how we play.</p>
 </aside></div>

 

<p>Other times, animals don't intentionally generate humor, but their humor "rings" like a convenience store bell, signaling their transition between mistake-predominant and OK-predominant emotions&mdash;like how General Zod is first startled by Trevor <callback>(mistake-predominance)</callback>, and then transitions back to being placid <callback>(OK-predominance)</callback>. Zod has to "ring" through humor to make this transition, maybe with a brief tail wag.</p>

<img src=../images/closer-look/cl-animals/cl-animals-0-zod-evaluations.png
    alt="This evaluation graph for General Zod shows how humor 'rings' as Zod transitions from OK-predominant (calm) to mistake-predominant (concerned) back to OK-predominant (calm)."

<h5>Humor family words</h5> 

<p>We can use humor family words to think about where animals feel humor. For instance, dogs and cats feel humor when they feel:</p>

<ul class="close-list">

<li>
    <emotions>achievement</emotions> <callback>(successful hunting)</callback>
</li> 
<li>
    <emotions>appreciation</emotions> <callback>(petting)</callback>
</li>

<li><emotions>comfort</emotions> <callback>(warmth)</callback>
  </li>  
<li><emotions>connection</emotions> <callback>(attention)</callback>
       </li> 
<li>
        <emotions>generosity</emotions> <callback>(treats)</callback>
  </li>
  
    <li>
        <emotions>relief</emotions> <callback>(removal of something stressful)</callback>
    </li>
    
     <li>
           <emotions>welcome</emotions> <callback>(inviting a dog up on furniture)</callback>
      </li>
      </ul>
      
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>



<h5>Humor tells</h5> 

<p>Social animals have humor tells too. They'll consistently show humor tells when mistakes are OK, like by:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>seeking out other animals</li>
    <li>touching each other</li>
    <li>making contented noises</li>
    <li>making loud noises </li>
    <li>losing awareness of what’s around them</li>
    <li>moving non-normatively</li>
    <li>becoming bolder</li>
    <li>relaxing</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

 

<h5>Humor profiles</h5> 
 
<p>Each species has their own <term>species</term> humor profile. Within that template, each member of that species has their own <term2>individual</term2> humor profile.</p>


<div class="for-instance"><aside class="consider">
<consider>For instance:</consider>
          <p>This is like how all dogs wag their tails, but each dog wags their tail a bit differently.</p>
</aside>
</div>    
 

<p>Animal humor profiles don’t usually look much like a human humor profile. While <term>dogs</term> can emote in ways that have nuance to us, <term2>cats</term2> are less readable to us&mdash;and <em>crows</em> even less so.</p>

<p>Of course, our inability to read the emotional state of a crow doesn't mean other crows have the same inability. And the more we watch or interact with crows <callback>(or cats or dogs)</callback>, the more evaluatory information we can pull from them.</p>



<h5>Emotion networks</h5> 
 
<div class="h3">
 <p>Social animals have emotion networks so they can form groups and share evaluatory information with each other.</p>
 
  
 
 <div class="for-instance">
    <aside class="consider">
          <consider>For instance:</consider>
          
          <p> Crows will spread out across a field to eat&mdash;and if one crow notices a mistake, the others pick up on this too through their emotional network.</p> 
          
          <p>If many crows are anxious, but one becomes calm, the others will calm down too. If they can’t synchronize, they squabble.</p>
     </aside>
 </div>
 
  
 
 <p>In this case, humor isn’t some exceptional side-development that exists apart from “normal” function&mdash;humor is just part and parcel of an emotion network. Humor is like one frequency of how animals communicate evaluatory information.</p>
</div>

 Example (Crows)
 
 </button>
  
<div class="content-example">

  <p>We can apply everything in the interval to a video of crows trying to pull a dog's tail:</p> 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NstPHbrOsos?si=og-s6KFdBAP3NNxN&amp;start=21&amp;end=81" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This is an activity with mistakes and OKs. Sometimes the mistakes are larger, and the crows feel mistake-predominant emotions&mdash;sometimes the OK is larger, and they feel OK-predominant emotions. We'll see them cycling through these states throughout this video.</p>

<p>We can think of the crows as intentionally trying to generate humor. <callback>("Play.")</callback> They're trying to find the Goldilocks experiential zone where there's not too much mistake, not too much OK. The sweet spot is where they feel they're experiencing novelty while also mitigating risk. Their emotion network helps them find this spot by sharing information about mistakes and OKs.</p>

<p>Unlike dogs, crows don't have humor tells that we find easy to read. Each individual crow would have its own humor profile drawn from a "crow humor profile" that's opaque to us, doubly so without strong familiarity with crows. But when described abstractly, we still can see humor tells in this video, like <humor-tells>energy</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>informal movement</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>loosening</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>reduction of physical tension</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>efforts to spread humor</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>fast thinking</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>focusing on present</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>increased agency</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>loss of overall situational awareness</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>non-normative behavior</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>social tightening</humor-tells>, and so on.</p>

<p>We'd expect the crows to express these humor tells as they transition between mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotional states&mdash;which we often describe through humor family words.</p>

<p>We use humor family words to characterize their motivations as well: they want to feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on. Like humans, we can prompt feelings of <emotions>relief</emotions> or <emotions>safety</emotions> by intentionally creating danger and transitioning out of it.</p>

<p>Finally, we can use the rest of our model of humor to contextualize their emotional situation. How intense is this humor? How long is its duration? Is it mostly humor, or a much more complicated emotional state? Is the dog feeling humor, or no?</p>

<p>This helps us think through animal behavior in a way inclusive to humor&mdash;without becoming stuck on the absence of elements from human humor profiles, like the lack of smiling, laughing, literary puns, and so on. Humor allows for quick, intuitive explanations of some behavior, and helps us avoid feeling bewildered. <callback>("what are these crows doing?")</callback></p>

<p>Even though our model applies relatively well to all social animals, it’s sometimes still uncomfortable to say outright that non-human animals feel humor. We might worry that it’s anthropomorphizing them in ways that aren’t useful.</p> 

<p>It’s worth noticing that, whatever the merits of that concern, it puts a double standard on <em>humor</em> that we don’t for other emotions. Since humor is just a normal, regular emotion, it's no more or less weird to say animals feel <term>humor</term> as it is to say they feel <term2>fear</term2>.</p> 

<p>In our day-to-day lives, we acceptably describe animals as feeling <emotions>afraid, anxious, bored, curious, playful, lonely, sad, social, stressed,</emotions> and so on. We should also see <emotions>humor</emotions> as an equally acceptably day-to-day way of describing animal emotions&mdash;whatever uncertainty we have in precise contexts about what animals are "really" feeling. <callback>(“How similar is cat stress to human stress?”)</callback></p>

<p>The wider point to all this isn’t actually about <term>animals</term>, but about <term2>us</term2>&mdash;and how we think about humor. When we understand how humor can sensibly apply to animals&mdash;even though they can’t tell jokes&mdash;we’re ready to more deeply understand how humor applies to us in our lives.</p>

<div class="consider">
 <aside class="consider">
     <consider>Consider:</consider>
     
     <p>Trevor would struggle to understand humor if he can’t escape a learned connection between humor and jokes:</p>
     
      
     
     <div class="vignette">
         <blockquote>
             <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*scratching General Zod*</action> <speech>“I think animals feel humor.”</speech></p>
             
             <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“No they don’t! If they did, we’d market comedies to them!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor thinks humor means laughing at comedic movies)</notes></p>
         </blockquote>
     </div>
     
      
     
     <p>Trevor’s essentially making a non sequitur&mdash;a bit like saying animals must not feel hunger because they never made pizzerias! </p>
 </aside>
</div>


<p>Humor is part of a broader system, where communication, evaluations, groups, and senses all relate together. It allows us to make assessments about the world around us, and quickly communalize those assessments&mdash;something that allows groups to form and to function well.</p> 

<p>In that light, it’s not surprising that social animals would have similar ways of sharing information together, whether those animals are humans or crows&mdash;including through humor.</p>

<p>To a greater degree than other animals, humans combine their emotion network with a complementing system of language, which allows us to topicalize our evaluatory information. Even though this gives a distinctive layer to our interactions relative to other animals, the foundation is still a similar system that exists for similar reasons among all social animals.</p>
