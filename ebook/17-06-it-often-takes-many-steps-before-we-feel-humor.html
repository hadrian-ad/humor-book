    <h3 id="17-06">Reaching tripwires after several steps</h3>
    
    
<p>Humor is something we develop a situation toward. Sometimes this happens quickly, in what seems like a <term>single</term> step&mdash;other times it happens more slowly, over what seems like <term2>many</term2> steps:</p>

             <img src=../images/16c-images-humor-tripwires/16-06-it-often-takes-many-steps-before-we-feel-humor/16-06-0-steps-to-humor.png

    alt="This image shows two vector figures side by side, the first labeled 'one step to humor,' the other labeled 'many steps to humor.' In the first, the situation develops quickly to humor, and in the second the momentum of the situational ball changes frequently, and the situtation develops slowly to humor.";
    title="Steps to humor";
    style="max-width: 33rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>In both cases above, humor happens after <em>time</em>. Even when humor happens quickly, it's not instantaneous.</p>
<!--
<div class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>

<p>When we listen to a quick pun, we still have to listen to it&mdash;when we hike to the top of a scenic overlook, we still have to hike there. In both cases, our evaluations are changing over time.</p> 
   
    </div>
-->
    
    <p>    
    It's obvious that it sometimes takes a while to reach a humor outcome&mdash;like how we can't always <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome> in one sentence. That's because the person we’re talking with may:</p> 

    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>disagree with us at first</li>
        <li>not understand the argument</li>
        <li>ask for clarification</li>
        <li>need more context</li>
        <li>give a counterpoint</li>
        <li>take time to think it over</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To push them into a humor outcome, we have to be aware of how and why their tripwire is guarded, and be responsive to those guards. It’s only after a shared development of the emotional situation that they’ll feel we’ve <humor-outcome>supported our argument</humor-outcome>:</p>

<p>It’s the same for all humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on. Sometimes, we reach these outcomes quickly&mdash;but other times, we have to develop the situation that way over initial guardedness.</p>

<p>If we thought a humor attempt had to be successful from the first sentence, we’d be playing a game with the wrong rules&mdash;and we’d often struggle to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, and so on: </p>

<p>Humor takes some situational assembly&mdash;which is why it’s often helpful to think of humor as the <term>conclusion</term> that we work toward, rather than <term2>beginning</term2> that starts something.</p>
