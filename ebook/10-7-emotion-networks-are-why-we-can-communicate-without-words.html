    <h3 id="10-07">Emotion networks are why we can communicate without words</h3>
    

<p>Emotion networks can help us look past words and speaking. This helps us see a deeper foundation to how people interact with each other.</p>
 
<p>We can do all kinds of interactions wordlessly, like when we:</p>
 
  
  <!--
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance</p>
      
      <p>People synchronize mistakes and OKs over an emotional network. That means emotion networks are the medium that we use to influence others into balanced evaluations&mdash;into humor.</p>

      </div>  
      -->

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>assemble things together <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>assign tasks with a specified degree of urgency <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>claim a section of a beach <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>express affection <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>fan out to search for something <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>flirt with someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>indicate something with a specified degree of permissiveness <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>organize ourselves on a bus <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show that we’re unbothered <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show support <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>walk around busy streets <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>welcome someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<!--
<p>Humor plays a role in all of those things above&mdash;we smile to share evaluations, which allows others to reach evaluatory consensus with us.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>This helps us see how humor is more than something that happens in reaction to jokes. Instead, jokes are using on a broader <sem-weak>system</sem-weak> of grouping around evaluations. Focusing on this <sem-weak>system</sem-weak> helps us see a fuller scope to something like humor.</p>
</div>
-->

<p>All this happens because of our emotion network&mdash;which exchanges information whether or not we're using words. It's more foundational than speech.</p> 

<p>This is often easiest to see in dramatic circumstances, like when:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>awareness of a shocking event trickles from one end of the bar to everyone else <callback>(without spoken explanation)</callback></li>
    <li>belligerent attitudes harden people into groups <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>fear travels throughout a city <callback>(without spoken reasoning)</callback></li>
    <li>festive attitudes draw people together <callback>(without spoken invitation)</callback></li>
    <li>good news ripples through a classroom <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>a restaurant suddenly falls silent <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>uncertainty sweeps through a train <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>worried crowds soften into release and celebration <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>It's worth noticing above that we usually think <term>evaluations</term> are <em>more</em> important than the <term2>context</term2>. That's because our evaluations are foundational&mdash;they come first.</p>

<div class="consider">
  <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
       <p>If we're about to go into a bar, we don't care so much <term>what</term> people are talking about. We instead care about <term2>how</term2> they're talking about things&mdash;whether they're afraid, belligerent, laughing, relaxed, and so on.</p> 
       
       <p>Similarly, if a bar we're in suddenly goes silent, we'll go silent too&mdash;since our first concern isn't <term>what</term> happened, it's how people <term2>feel</term2> about what happened.</p>
   </aside>    
    </div>
    <!--
    <p>This all is important to humor. Humor often happens as smiles exchanged while walking or after a greeting, laughter after hugging or recieving good news, bumping shoulders affectionately as someone  rolls their eyes, and other interactions.</p>
    
     <p>These can be wordless or not&mdash;but despite how important these instances of humor are to our sense of being around others, we don't always find it easy to talk about how or why this happens. This is especially true when humor happens wordlessly.</p> 
     
     -->


<p>Emotion networks are the social or evaluatory medium that everything in our lives happens in&mdash;and is the medium that transmits our humor, or shifts our evaluations into humor.</p>





<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>This isn't specific to <term>humor</term>&mdash;it's the same for <term>any</term> emotion. Mistake-predominate emotions can <em>also</em> happen simply by exchanging looks or listening to angry people. Words are <term2>sometimes</term2> involved, but not <term2>always</term2>.</p>
    </aside>
</div>




 
 <aside class="box">
     <p><b>Medium.</b> Emotion networks are important! We can't ignore them&mdash;trying to learn about humor without mentioning emotion networks would be like trying to learn about fish without mentioning water.</p>
      
     <p>When we think about the people in our lives who have been good at making others laugh, we'll notice that they often have a field-like quality of influence on people around them&mdash;part of their good understanding of the overall emotional situation.</p> 
     
     <p>In other words, they're skilled at being able to see, interpret, and act within these emotion networks! This skill is inseparable from their broader skill at making others laugh. It's a skill we can improve ourselves through attention and practice.</p>
