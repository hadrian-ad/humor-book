            </h4>
    
         
<p>We can look at two different high-level metaphorical models for humor:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li><strong>A “particle” model of humor.</strong> In this metaphorical model, humor is like a <term>particle</term> that’s emitted by something&mdash;and if a humor particle strikes us, we feel humor. Humor is something that comes to us from <term2>outside</term2> of us.</li> 
    
    <li><strong>A “loom” model of humor.</strong> In this metaphorical model, our experiences are a <term>weave</term> of associations, which creates a kind of emotional fabric&mdash;whether we feel anger, humor, or so on depends on what is woven together, and how. Humor is something that comes from <term2>within</term2> us.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Our default way of thinking and talking about humor is usually a “particle” model. We might start watching a show, which tries to  “land” jokes that “hit” us right&mdash;and it all seems to be something done to us, from outside of us.</p>

<p>The problem with a particle model is that it works less well once we go beyond performers and passive audiences&mdash;like when we feel humor:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>while just lying on the couch</li>
    <li>when someone is angry at us</li>
    <li>when someone compliments us</li>
    <li>by waking up looking forward to the day</li>
    <li>off and on while having a conversation with a friend</li>
</ul>

  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>In these cases, the "loom" model is more inclusive to more experiences, and explains them more completely. Something is happening within us that explains the humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
  <aside class="consider">
          <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>At first, a metaphor like “internal weaving” can feel unwieldy. But the interaction of our attention, evaluations, expectations, memories, observations, thoughts, and so on does create an analogy to a loom:</p>
        
            <img class="img-indent"
            src="../images/closer-look/cl-looms-vs-particles/cl-0-loom-internal-loom.png"
            title="Comparing 'loom fabric' to 'emotional fabric'"
            alt="This image compares 'fabric woven on loom' with 'emotional fabric woven on internal loom.' One shows the verticle lines of warp with the connecting meander of the weft. The other figure shows a grid of topic circles, with a line of focus going through them activating them in a way that mimics the weft of the fabric."
            style="max-width:23rem;">
            
        <p>This metaphorical internal loom makes up the “fabric” of experiences.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>These metaphorical models <callback>("particles" "looms")</callback> don’t matter so much in themselves&mdash;they’re not meant to be <term>practical</term>. Instead, they’re meant to be <term2>framing</term2>&mdash;big-picture methods of how we orient our thoughts about humor.</p> 

<p>Depending on which model we use, our methods and observations of humor change.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>For instance:</consider>
    
    <aside class="consider">
        <p>If we think that generating humor is a bit like shooting bottles on a fence <callback>(particle model)</callback>, the word humor will make us think about jokes or things that seem to straightforwardly contain or deliver humor.</p>  
        
        <p>But if we think that generating humor is a bit like weaving <callback>(loom model)</callback>, we’ll think more broadly about humor&mdash;as something embedded and created within a situation, with jokes only sometimes relevant to this process.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>We saw this with Elias, who found jokes themselves to be flat <callback>(particle model)</callback>. But when he combined those jokes with elements of his life, he felt more intricate, situationally-connected humor <callback>(loom model)</callback>.</p>

<p>When Jennifer made Sam laugh, she didn’t use a joke or anything funny or odd <callback>(particle model)</callback>&mdash;instead, she helped topics be active together, like ‘Sam’s physical appearance’ and ‘Jennifer’s opinion of him’&mdash;and shifted both of them together to generate humor <callback>(loom model)</callback>. Jennifer didn't <term>transmit</term> humor so much as helped <term2>weave</term2> it within Sam.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <aside class="consider">
        <p>Jennifer would handicap herself if she approached Sam as if he was a bottle she was trying to shoot with jokes.</p> 
        
        <p>That metaphor would shift focus away from Sam and onto things external to him&mdash;or even onto Jennifer herself. <callback>(“What can *I* do to unilaterally force Sam to feel humor?”</callback> instead of <callback>“what does *Sam* need to have happen for him to feel humor?”)</callback></p>
    </aside>
</div> 

<p>The point isn't that we should spend lots of time thinking about these high-level metaphors. Instead, the point is to catch the general approach to this book&mdash;which is <term>less</term> “what makes a joke funny” <callback>(particle model)</callback> and <term2>more</term2> “what about someone makes a joke funny to them?” <callback>(Loom model.)</callback> </p> 

<p>That’s why we won’t be focusing on jokes so much as we will on the thing <sem-weak>behind</sem-weak> jokes&mdash;the emotional fabric that we’ll want to be able to read and work on.</p>

<p>As we do this, we'll learn how to generate humor with the help of things we don’t always think of as “humor”&mdash;like arguments, compliments, favors, gifts, gratitude, insults, looks, needling, rough-housing, teasing, timing, and so on. Sometimes we can even generate humor by choosing to do nothing at all.</p>

<p>This will be a fulfilling, powerful way of approaching humor. Instead of looking at humor through a straw, by focusing only on jokes&mdash;we'll broaden the horizons of our skills and deepen their effect by focusing on the internal happenings within people. </p>

        We can segment our global evaluation into arbitrary sets of bounded evaluations. These <vocab>topics</vocab> will bound and label our evaluation graphs.
