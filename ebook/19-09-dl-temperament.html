<p>The word "humor" is one of the most complicated in the English language. It's a bit like look at an archeological site with different but mingling strata&mdash;that's also a bustling city comfortably camped among it all.</p> 

<p>We looked at the <a href="9-9-dl-emotions.html">history of this word before</a>, but we can look a bit deeper. The story goes back to the word <sem-weak><span lang="el">chymos</span></sem-weak>, which in Ancient Greece meant <callback>“sap, flavor.”</callback> These saps or flavors <callback>("the four flavors")</callback> within humans were used as terminology for a broader framework of health, behavior, and other things.</p>

<p>When these books were translated into English, they translated <sem-weak><span lang="el">chymos</span></sem-weak> using the word “humor.” <callback>(“Liquid, juice”)</callback> This gave English the “four humors” and other variations&mdash;and it was this translation that imbued "humor" with a complex relation to personality and emotions that has been there ever since.</p>

<p>We still use remnants of the “four humors” in our language. Someone is bilious <callback>(bile - angry)</callback>, or sanguine <callback>(blood - vivacious)</callback>, or melancholic <callback>(black bile - sad)</callback>. The fourth is rarer and more dated: phlegm, for self-possession.</p>
 
<p>A phlegmatic remark is one of stoic understatement. If it’s pouring rain and say <callback>“bit damp today, isn’t it?”</callback> we’re displaying what would have been considered phlegm.</p>

 <p>The cultivated phlegmatic image was popular in the 19th and 20th century <callback>(“Dr. Livingston, I presume?”)</callback> where the emphasis was on seeming controlled, restrained, stoic, understated, and so on. This was especially true in England, where, in an increasingly nationalistic environment, phlegm came to be seen as the “English humor”&mdash;as opposed to whichever humor was valued or predominant of the French, Spanish, and so on.</p>
  
   <p>Even today, phlegm is often familiar to us as “British humor”&mdash;like when English characters are presented as amusingly phlegmatic:</p>

       <p><narration>Owen and Emma are watching <booktitle>Fired Fireman: Crown the King</booktitle>.</narration></p>
        <p><narration>Chief falls through the roof and lands in a chair in the aristocratic parlor. Sir Windlebury is at his desk and unperturbed. He raises his eyebrow calmly.</narration></p>

        <p><narration>Owen and Emma laugh.</narration></p>
   </blockquote>
    </div>

   <div class="vignette"> 
        <blockquote>
   <p><narration>Owen is watching a James Bond movie.</narration></p> 
<p><narration>After being poisoned by the villain, Bond flees a high-stakes poker game for medical attention. After harrowing self-healthcare in his car, including having to restart his heart, he returns to the poker game.</narration></p>
                    
   <p><narration>The villain is shocked.</narration></p>
                       
  <p><speaker>Bond:</speaker> <internalaction>(calmly)</internalaction> <action>*barest hint of a smirk*</action> <speech>"Now. Where were we?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;phlegm)</notes></p> 
                          
<p><narration>Owen loves how cool under pressure James Bond is.</narration></p></blockquote> </div>  
                


<p>The idea that English had a particular humor <callback>(sap or flavor)</callback> associated with them was a nationalized idea of “temperament.”</p>  

<p>Long ago, temperament meant <callback>“to mix; blend; proportion of mixture.”</callback> So an ointment or meat rub had a temperament&mdash;and a human could have a temperament too: a temperament of humors. We could be disproportionately bilious, for instance—a bad temper, a bad mix. Or we could have a temperament of poise&mdash;of phlegm.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>This old meaning of temperament still lingers in the meanings of the word today.</p> 
        
        <p>When we say someone is in “good humor,” we usually don’t mean that they’re laughing: we mean they have a good temperament of humors, a good personality mix.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>All this is one part of how “humor” went from “liquids” to many of the thing humor means today&mdash;with the word strongly influenced by the now-archaic word phlegm. This is one reason today's "humor" frequently has connotations with a wry or calm posture toward experience. <callback>(The English humor.)</callback></p>

<div class="consider"><aside class="consider"><consider>Consider</consider>
        
        <p>To feel the influence of phlegm has on the modern day word of humor, we can compare: "reacting with <term>humor</term>" to "reacting with <term2>anger/sadness/joy</term2>."</p> 
        
        <p>We can feel humor has a subtext of detachment or self-awareness that isn't present in the other words. This lift of phlegm is part of what gave the word such a distinctive niche, and made <callback>(the English)</callback> humor spread world-wide, being adopted by many languages.</p>
        
        <p>Since that predominant sense of detachment, the word "humor" has broadened, changed, and filled other niches&mdash;even as some uses retain this historical slice of it.</p>
    </aside>    </div>
    



<p>None of this is to endorse those meanings of these words, or overstate the importance that these history timelapses have. Instead, the history helps us shake some of the assumptions around a word like “humor.”</p> 

   <p>Humor is a varied word with changing meaning. It doesn't mean one thing, and doesn't correspond to one thing in our experience. In this book, we are establishing one of any number of potential ways of thinking about "humor"&mdash;which is similar too but in other ways distinct from some ways humor is used today.</p>
    
<p>The language we use to describe our experiences in the world is much stranger and conflicting than we sometimes acknowledge. Coming to see this clearly is an important way to step back and re-examine with fresh eyes how we think about ourselves.</p>

<p>Humor and humor attempts have degrees of comparative fit to their emotional situation. We can estimate something's "fittedness" by its integration to a situation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fittedness focuses on how people <a href="16-01-humor-can-fit-a-situation.html">do react</a> to humor or humor attempts, not how someone thinks they "should" react.</li>
    
    <li>We can estimate fittedness of humor or humor attempts by accounting for relevancy of <a href="16-02-topics-determine-fittedness.html">topics</a>, <a href="16-03-humor-family-words-determine-fittedness.html">humor family words</a>, and <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">humor outcomes</a>. </li>
    
    <li>Higher fittedness increases <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">emotional activity</a> and leads to greater toleration on an emotion network.</li>
