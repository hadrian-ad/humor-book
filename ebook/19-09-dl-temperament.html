<p>The word "humor" is one of the most complicated in the English language. It's a bit like looking at an archeological site with different but mingling strata. We looked at the <a href="9-9-dl-emotions.html">history of this word before</a>, but we can look a bit deeper to gain some insight.</p>

<p>Ancient Greece had a word <sem-weak>chymos</sem-weak>, which meant <callback>“sap, flavor.”</callback> These were the four saps of humans—the four flavors. This provided terminology for a broader framework of health, behavior, and other things.</p>

<p>When these books were translated from Greek to English, the word “humor,” meaning <callback>“liquid, juice,”</callback> was used to translate <sem-weak>chymos</sem-weak>. This gave English the “four humors” or other models of humors, the meaning of which evolved over time in an English context.</p>

<p>It was this translation which imbued “humor” with a complex relation to personality and emotions that has been there ever since.</p>

<p>We still use remnants of the “four humors” in our language. Someone is bilious <callback>(bile - angry)</callback>, or sanguine <callback>(blood - vivacious)</callback>, or melancholic <callback>(black bile - sad)</callback>. The fourth is rarer and more dated: phlegm, for self-possession.</p>
 
<p>A phlegmatic remark is one of stoic understatement. If it’s pouring rain and say <callback>“bit damp today, isn’t it?”</callback> we’re displaying what would have been considered phlegm. Phlegm is often familiar to us as “British humor,” including when aristocratic English characters are presented as amusingly phlegmatic:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
       <p><narration>Owen and Emma are watching <booktitle>Fired Fireman: Crown the King</booktitle>.</narration></p>
        <p><narration>Chief falls through the roof and lands in a chair in the aristocratic parlor. Sir Windlebury is at his desk and unperturbed. He raises his eyebrow calmly.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Sir Windlebury:</speaker> <action>*into intercom*</action> <speach>“Jeeves? The guests are here. Could you bring us some tea?”</speach> <notes>(&larr;phlegm)</notes></p>
        <p><narration>Owen and Emma laugh.</narration></p>
   </blockquote>
    </div>

   <div class="vignette"> 
        <blockquote>
   <p><narration>Owen is watching a James Bond movie.</narration></p> 
<p><narration>After being poisoned by the villain, Bond flees a high-stakes poker game for medical attention. After having his heart restarted and receiving antivenom, he returns to the poker game.</narration></p>
                    
   <p><narration>The villain is shocked.</narration></p>
                       
  <p><speaker>Bond:</speaker> <speech>"Now, where were we?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;phlegm)</notes></p> 
                          
<p><narration>Owen loves how cool under pressure James Bond is.</narration></p></blockquote> </div>  
                
<p>The cultivated phlegmatic image was popular in the 19th and 20th century <callback>(“Dr. Livingston, I presume?”)</callback> where the emphasis was on seeming controlled, restrained, stoic, understated, and so on. This was especially true in England, where a variety of factors pushed phlegm to be seen as the “English humor”&mdash;as opposed to whichever humor was valued or predominant of the French, Spanish, and so on.</p>

<p>This was a nationalized idea of “temperament.”  Long ago, temperament meant <callback>“to mix; blend; proportion of mixture.”</callback> So an ointment or meat rub had a temperament&mdash;and a human could have a temperament too: a temperament of humors.</p> 

<p>We could be disproportionately bilious, for instance—a bad temper, a bad mix. Or we could have a temperament of poise&mdash;of phlegm.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>This old meaning of temperament still lingers in the meanings of the word today today.</p> 
        
        <p>When we say someone is in “good humor,” we usually don’t mean that they’re laughing: we mean they have a good temperament of humors, a good personality mix.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>This is one part of how “humor” went from “liquids” to many of the thing humor means today&mdash;with humor used in place of the now-archaic word phlegm. This is one reason today's "humor" frequently has connotations with a wry or calm posture toward experience. <callback>(The English humor.)</callback></p>

<div class="consider"><aside class="consider"><consider>Consider</consider>
        
        <p>To feel the influence of phlegm has on the modern day word of humor by comparing: "reacting with humor" to "reacting with anger/sadness/joy."</p> 
        
        <p>We can feel a subtext of detachement or self-awareness to humor that isn't present in the other words.</p>
        
        <p>It’s this lift that gave the word such a distinctive niche, and made "(the English) humor" spread world-wide.</p>
        
        <p>Since then, the word has broadened, changed, and filled other niches&mdash;with some uses retaining this historical slice of it.</p>
    </aside>    </div>
    



<p>None of this is to endorse these words, or overstate the importance of these timelapses of these words. Instead, the history helps us shake some of the assumptions around a word like “humor.”</p> 

   <p>Humor is a varied word with changing meaning. It doesn't mean one thing, and doesn't correspond to one thing in our experience. In this book, we are establishing one of any number of potential ways of thinking about "humor," which is similar too but in other ways distinct from some ways humor is used today.</p>
    
<p>The language we use to describe our experiences in the world is much stranger and conflicting than we sometimes akcnowledge. Coming to see this clearly is an important way to step back and re-examine with fresh eyes how we think about ourselves.</p>

<p>Humor and humor attempts have degrees of comparative fit to their emotional situation. We can estimate something's "fittedness" by its integration to a situation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fittedness focuses on how people <a href="16-01-humor-can-fit-a-situation.html">do react</a> to humor or humor attempts, not how someone thinks they "should" react.</li>
    
    <li>We can estimate fittedness of humor or humor attempts by accounting for relevancy of <a href="16-02-topics-determine-fittedness.html">topics</a>, <a href="16-03-humor-family-words-determine-fittedness.html">humor family words</a>, and <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">humor outcomes</a>. </li>
    
    <li>Higher fittedness increases <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">emotional activity</a> and leads to greater toleration on an emotion network.</li>
