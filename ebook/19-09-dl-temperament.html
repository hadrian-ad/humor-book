<p>The word "humor" is one of the more knotted words in the English language. The word itself is like a bustling city with an old quarter that's built on an archeological site with mingling strata. There's a lot going on!</p> 

<p>We looked at the <a href="9-9-dl-emotions.html">history of this word before</a>, but we can go a bit deeper. The story goes back to the word <sem-weak><span lang="el">chymos</span></sem-weak>, which in Ancient Greece meant <callback>“sap, flavor.”</callback> Human saps or flavors <callback>("the four flavors")</callback> were used as terminology for a broader framework of health, behavior, and other things.</p>

<p>When these books were translated into English, they translated <sem-weak><span lang="el">chymos</span></sem-weak> with the word “humor.” <callback>(“Liquid, juice”)</callback> This gave English the “four humors” and other variations&mdash;and it was this translation that imbued "humor" with a complex, quasi-medical and quasi-metaphorical relation to personality and emotions that has been there ever since.</p>

<p>We still use remnants of the “four humors” in our language, some more common than others. We say people are angry, vivacious, sad, or self-possessed&mdash;just like we sometimes
say someone is bilious <callback>(bile - angry)</callback>, sanguine <callback>(blood - vivacious)</callback>, melancholic <callback>(black bile - sad)</callback>. The fourth, self-possession, had a liquid that is a less common word today: phlegm.</p>

<h5>Phlegm</h5>
 
<p>We easily recognize phlegmatic remarks: they're comments of stoic understatement. If it’s pouring rain and say <callback>“bit damp today, isn’t it?”</callback> we’re displaying what would have been considered phlegm.</p>

 <p>The cultivated phlegmatic image was popular in the 19th and 20th century <callback>(“Dr. Livingston, I presume?”)</callback>, where the emphasis was on seeming controlled, restrained, stoic, understated, and so on. This was especially true in England, where phlegm came to be seen as the “English humor”in an increasingly nationalistic environment.</p> 
 
 <p>Phlegm was variously seen as the aspirational, cultural, or even racial English temperament. Even today, phlegm is often familiar to us as “British humor”&mdash;like when English characters are presented as amusingly phlegmatic:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
       <p><narration>Owen and Emma are watching <booktitle>Fired Fireman: Crown the King</booktitle>.</narration></p>
        <p><narration>Chief falls through the roof and lands in a chair in the aristocratic parlor. Sir Windlebury is at his desk and unperturbed. He raises his eyebrow calmly.</narration></p>
        <p><speaker>Sir Windlebury:</speaker> <action>*into intercom*</action> <speach>“Jeeves? The guests are here. Could you bring us some tea?”</speach> <notes>(&larr;phlegm)</notes></p>
        <p><narration>Owen and Emma laugh.</narration></p>
   </blockquote>
    </div>

   <div class="vignette"> 
        <blockquote>
   <p><narration>Owen is watching a James Bond movie.</narration></p> 
<p><narration>After being poisoned by the villain, Bond stumbles away from a high-stakes poker game. After harrowing self-healthcare in his car, including having to restart his heart, he returns to the poker game.</narration></p>
                    
   <p><narration>The otherwise collected villain is speechless to see him alive.</narration></p>
                       
  <p><speaker>Bond:</speaker> <internalaction>(calmly)</internalaction> <action>*barest hint of an eye-smirk*</action> <speech>"Now. Where were we?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;phlegm)</notes></p> 
                          
<p><narration>Owen loves how cool under pressure James Bond is.</narration></p></blockquote> </div>  
                
<h5>Temperament</h5>

<p>The idea that English had a particular humor <callback>(sap or flavor)</callback> associated with them was a nationalized idea of “temperament.”</p>  

<p>Long ago, temperament meant <callback>“to mix; blend; proportion of mixture.”</callback> So an ointment or meat rub had a temperament&mdash;and a human could have a temperament too: a temperament of the four humors. If we were disproportionately bilious <callback>(too much bile)</callback>, we would have a bad temper, a bad mix. Or we could have a temperament of poise&mdash;of phlegm.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>This old meaning of temperament still lingers in the meanings of the word "humor" and "temperament" today.</p> 
        
        <p>When we say someone is in “good humor,” we don’t usually mean that they’re laughing: we mean they have a good temperament of humors, a good personality mix that makes them good to be around.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<h5>Modern meaning</h5>

<p>All this is one part of how “humor” went from “liquids” to the many things humor means today&mdash;with the word strongly influenced by the now-archaic word phlegm.</p> 

<p>This connection with phlegm <callback>(the English humor)</callback> is one reason today's "humor" frequently has connotations with a wry or calm posture toward experience. </p>

<div class="consider"><aside class="consider"><consider>Consider</consider>
        
        <p>To feel the influence of phlegm has on the modern day word of humor, we can compare: "he reacted with <term>humor</term> <callback>(phlegm)</callback>" to "he reacted with <term2>anger/sadness/joy</term2>."</p> 
        
        <p>In this case, we can feel how humor has a subtext of detachment or self-awareness. This lift by phlegm <callback>(of a reflective, self-careless posture)</callback> is part of what gave the word such a distinctive niche, and made "(the English) humor" essentially world-wide slang.</p>
            </aside>
                </div>
    
 <p>Since then, the word "humor" has broadened and changed from its earlier sense of detachment&mdash;even as some uses retain this historical slice of it.</p>

<h5>Today and beyond</h5>

<p>There's no need to overstate the importance of these historical timelapse of these words. The point of all this history is to help us shake some of the assumptions around a word like "humor"&mdash;and inject a sense of possibility, freedom, and clarity to how we think about ourselves.</p> 

   <p>Humor is a varied word with changing meaning. It doesn't mean one thing, and doesn't correspond to one thing in our experiences. In this book, we are establishing one of any number of potential ways we can think about "humor." Our definition of humor  is similar too but in other ways distinct from some ways humor is used today.</p>
    
<p>The language we use to describe our experiences in the world is much stranger and conflicting than we sometimes acknowledge. While "a sense of humor" is often described as a neccessity for health, simply saying so doesn't give much clarity.</p> 
    
    <p>It can be useful to step back, and re-examine with fresh eyes all the ways we were told to think about ourselves, and complement them with new ways as well.</p>

<p>Humor and humor attempts have degrees of comparative fit to their emotional situation. We can estimate something's "fittedness" by its integration to a situation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fittedness focuses on how people <a href="16-01-humor-can-fit-a-situation.html">do react</a> to humor or humor attempts, not how someone thinks they "should" react.</li>
    
    <li>We can estimate fittedness of humor or humor attempts by accounting for relevancy of <a href="16-02-topics-determine-fittedness.html">topics</a>, <a href="16-03-humor-family-words-determine-fittedness.html">humor family words</a>, and <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">humor outcomes</a>. </li>
    
    <li>Higher fittedness increases <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">emotional activity</a> and leads to greater toleration on an emotion network.</li>
