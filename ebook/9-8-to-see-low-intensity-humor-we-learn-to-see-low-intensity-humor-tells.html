There are low-intensity variations to all humor tells
</h3>


<p>It's relatively easy to see low-intensity smiles as <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>&mdash;it's obvious that a twinge in our cheeks is part of a smile's spectrum of intensity.</p> 

<p>But we can do the same thing for <em>all</em> humor tells.</p> 

<p>So while it's often obvious what a <term>high-intensity</term> variations of <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell> looks like&mdash;what does <term2>low-intensity</term2> variations of this humor tell look like?</p>

title="What do lower intensities of humor tells look like?"
alt="This image has two spectrums, both with less and more intense humor at either end. The top spectrum has the 'more intense' half circled, and an annotation says these humor tells are often obvious. Below that, the other spectrum has the lawer half circled and an annotation asks 'but what do they look like at lower intensities?'"

<p>We can practice seeing the entire spectrum of a humor tell by thinking about the lowest- <em>and</em> highest- variations of a humor tell:</p>

   <figure>
    
   <figurecaption> spectrum of loss of situational awareness</figurecaption>
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: rolling on the floor, clutching ourselves as we laugh, oblivious to everything.
        </li> 
        
    <li>
            A <term2>lowest-intensity</term2> variation: a blip in our focus; background noises may fade out, or we briefly lose track of our discomfort; when reading we may linger or pause on a word, blink, look up; and so on.
        </li>
        </ul>
</figure>

title="Complete spectrum of the humor tell 'loss of situational awareness'"
alt="This spectrum for the humor tell 'loss of situational awareness has a 'blip in our focus' on the less intense end, and 'rolling on the floor' on the more intense end. An annotation says 'loss of situational is everything between these two ends of intensities."

<figure>
<figurecaption>spectrum of social seeking</figurecaption>

    
    <ul>
       <li>
           A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: racing to find our partner and jumping into the same chair as them, beaming, looking at their face, grabbing their arm.
       </li>
        <li>
            A <term2>lowest-intensity</term2> variation: someone coming to mind, a faint urge to share something with someone, an increased awareness of who is or isn’t around us, and so on.
        </li>
        </ul>
</figure>


<figure>
   <figurecaption>spectrum of touching self</figurecaption>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: crossing our arms, one hand on our face, another on our stomach, legs twisted, bent forward over ourselves.
        </li>
        <li>
            A <term2>lowest-intensity</term2> variation: using a finger to tap our chin, hair, thigh, or so on.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </figure>
    
    
<figure>
   <figurecaption>spectrum of loosening</figurecaption>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
              A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: melting into the couch, draping one arm across a cushion and another dangling to the ground below.
        </li>
            
            <li>
                A <term2>lowest-intensity</term2> variation: adjusting our head; taking a longer breath; repositioning; lowering our shoulders; and so on.
            </li>
    </ul>
    </figure>    
    
<figure><figurecaption>spectrum of focusing on present</figurecaption>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            A <term>highest-intensity</term> variation: intensely focusing on a video we're watching, completely losing any concern about the past or future or things not nearby.
        </li>
        
    <li>
            A <term2>lowest-intensity</term2> variation: less comparison or contrast with the future or past. For instance, we may have a chore we’re not looking forward to, but the negative anticipation dims somewhat as we focus on the present.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </figure>
<p>We already experience or see low-intensity humor in our lives&mdash;but we don't always recognize it as "humor" without it being pointed out. </p>

<div class="for-instance">
 <aside class="consider">
         <consider>For instance:</consider>
        
       <p>If we laugh loudly and clasp our hands on top of our head, it's obvious to us that this is humor (<humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>). But if we give a short exhale and put a finger on our chin (<humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>), it's <em>not</em> always obvious this is humor&mdash;even though they both have  the same humor tells!</p>
   </aside>
    </div>

<p>Once we see the full range of a humor tell, we can better notice low-intensity humor as humor.</p>

<img src="../images/9c-images-humor-profile/9-8-to-see-low-intensity-humor-we-learn-to-see-low-intensity-humor-tells/9-8-2.png"

title="All intensities of humor are 'humor'"
alt="This spectrum plot has two places marked, one toward the less intense end and the other toward the more intense end. An annotation notes that a collection of humor tells on either end are both 'humor,' just at different intensities."
style="max-width:; margin-left:"
>

<p>It also gives us the tools to make better sense of different humor profiles&mdash;since each of us expresses low-intensity humor differently.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>
            
            <p>The lowest-hanging fruit to feeling more humor is&mdash;to notice the humor we already feel! Once we recognize blips in our focus as very low-intensity humor, we have sparks of humor to play with.
            </p></aside>
</div>
    

   <aside class="box">
         <p><headline>What's it like?</headline> So what’s an experience of humor like? It’s not a centralized experience, like touching an object or looking at a mood ring. It’s also not the same experience each time. Instead, we describe humor through patterns that are inclusive to various intensities and durations.</p>
        
        <p>This is why there’s no way to specifically describe what humor is like, for the same reason we can’t describe what a “walk to the store” is like. All walks to the store aren't a single thing we can describe! Since every walk to any store is a bit different each time for everyone, we can only describe patterns and common elements that may make up the experience.</p>
