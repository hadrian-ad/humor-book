<p>We usually think of our senses like this: our senses keep us aware of <term>what</term> is around us.</p> 

<p>But an interesting alternative perspective is this: our senses let us be aware of what’s <term2>changing</term2> around us.</p> 

<p>This makes our senses “difference noticers.” It's why our eyes glide over familiar things, but immediately latch onto very small differences, like a:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>new grey hair</li>
   <li>new flower in our yard</li>
    <li>new behavior in the dog</li>
    <li>frame that’s no longer level</li>
    <li>small scratch on our partner’s face</li>
    
    <li>fork that’s out of place on the counter</li>
    <li>single typo in a four-hundred-page book</li>    
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Our senses <term>de-emphasize</term> whatever <term>accords</term> with our expectations, while <term2>emphasizing</term2> things that <term2>deviate</term2> from those expectations. That means our senses <em>prioritize</em> our awareness of mistakes.</p>

    alt="This illustration shows the lifecycle of mistakes. First, we screen out what's expected, which leaves things contrary to expectations. Then those things become expected, which we screen out. This leaves things contrary to expectations, and so on and so on."
    style="max-width:24rem; margin-top: .5rem">



<p>The things that accord with what we expect accrue <vocab>perceptual camouflage</vocab>&mdash;our attention slides off them. The more perceptual camouflage something has, the more effort it takes to evaluate something and to generate emotions from it.</p> 

<p>By screening out the things that have perceptual camouflage, we create a flat backdrop <callback>(“expectations”)</callback> that mistakes <callback>(“<outcome-contrast>deviations</outcome-contrast> from expectations”)</callback> pop out on.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>Perceptual camouflage is a bit like laying out a white tablecloth on the grass. This flat background makes it easy to see insects crawling across it. If we weren’t able to use a tablecloth, it would be much harder to notice insects on the grass.</p>
        
        <p>By turning the expected things around us into a "tablecloth," anything that moves onto that tablecloth pops to attention.</p>
   </aside>
    </div>

<p>This is why the view from our new office may be intensely interesting to us at first&mdash;but stop generating emotions in us at all after a few weeks. We no longer notice or evaluate the view once it's fully accrued perceptual camouflage.</p> 

<p>Perceptual camouflage can get stripped, like when a guest exclaims at the view from our office, or when smoke from a distant fire catches our eye. These bring the view back to our attention, making it noticeable again.</p>

<p>Similarly, we'll notice every creak and groan in our new house for a few weeks. But eventually we'll stop noticing any noises from our house at all&mdash;because those noises accrue perceptual camouflage.</p>

<p>By de-emphasizing regular sounds, we create a flat backdrop that lets even small noises to jump out at us&mdash;like how unexpected soft noises will demand our attention, even at the same time we no longer register the much louder cars, creaks, pipes, wind, and so on. </p>

<p>Sometimes, something happens that strips away all the perceptual camouflage on something, like when we:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
<li>get high <callback>(and everything becomes jewel-like)</callback></li>
<li>visit a new city <callback>(and everything seems interesting)</callback></li>
     <li>have a first snowfall <callback>(and the landscape seem new)</callback></li>
          <li>attend a street protest <callback>(and the world seems different)</callback></li>
      <li>use glasses for the first time <callback>(and everything seems clear)</callback></li>
      
    <li>celebrate a festival <callback>(and decorations reinvigorated an old space)</callback></li>
        <li>watch high winds <callback>(and we’re mesmerized by how the trees move)</callback></li>


    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>

<p>In these cases, since everything deviates from our expectations, <em>everything</em> is interesting to us!</p> 

<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>Normally, it takes effort to notice the branch outside our window. But after the first snowfall, it's hard <sem-weak>not</sem-weak> to look at the snowy branch! It attracts our attention.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>We experience moments vividly when something strips perceptual camouflage.</p>

<p>Sometimes, this vividness is part of mistake-predominant experiences&mdash;like how driving through high winds can cause us attentive worry, and not humor.</p> 

<p>But other times, these camouflage-stripping moments generate broad feelings of humor, like when Yasmin gets glasses for the first time. We often describe these positive experiences as being alive, interesting, intense, joyful, or so on.</p> 

<p>While all this happens with our <term>external</term> senses <callback>(what we hear or see)</callback>&mdash;it also happens with our <term2>internal</term2> senses too. <callback>(What we think or feel.)</callback></p> 

<p>In the same way we get used to a <term>view</term>, we also get used to a <term2>framing</term2>. Those framings accrue perceptual camouflage just like anything else, and eventually we stop giving evaluatory attention to that framing:</p>

<p>As we become used to framing something a particular way, that framing becomes expected and invisible. Those framings start to seem like just how the world is&mdash;and it becomes hard to give these framings attention.</p> 

<p>But alternative framings strip perceptual camouflage, making things seem new.</p>

<p>So in the same way looking at something from a <term>new angle</term> <callback>(our house, our face, a tourist attraction)</callback> generates mistakes, looking at something from a <term2>new framing</term2> also generates mistakes.</p>

<p>All this helps us think about how emotions and senses connect to mistakes. Mistakes are nubs of non-regular information. Our senses highlight those nubs for us, which fast-tracks them for evaluation. These evaluations of mistakes make up our evaluatory state&mdash;our emotional state. Sometimes, these evaluations are expressed as humor.</p> 

<p>This gives us a brief initial look at the connection between expectations, senses, and humor&mdash;and the connection between humor and the positive removal of perceptual camouflage.</p>

    <p>
    Humor doesn't just have a magnitude, but a <vocab>duration</vocab> as well. 
            </p>
            <ul>
    <li>
        The duration of humor is the
                duration that <strong><a href="5-0-duration.html">evaluations are near to a 1 ratio</a></strong>.
    </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
    <li>
        Our evaluations have a varying resistance to change. This resistance is the <strong><a href="5-1-mistakes-have-varying-longevity.html">durability and broader integration</a></strong> of either our expectations or our perception of security. 
        
    </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
    <li>
        In the same way durable expectations can lead to long durations of humor, they can also lead to long durations of <strong><a href="5-2-durable-expectations-do-not-always-lead-to-humor.html"> any emotion</a></strong>.
