Each active topic contributes to our emotional state 
</h2>
  
<p>When a topic is active, it generates emotions into our emotional state:</p>
<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>
        <p>
        <strong>
            A.
        </strong> <narration>Seventh grade Emma remembers her old teacher Ms. Gardener. She feels very calm, thinking about her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic 'Ms. Gardener' is active, generating <emotions-in-notes>calmness</emotions-in-notes> into Emma's emotional state)</notes>

    alt="This focus diagram has a column for 'Ms. Gardner,' which is active at A and B and inactive between. At A and B, an arrow corresponds the topic to an emotional state box.

B has an emotional state box with diagonal lines, with an annotation that says 'topic generates humor into Emma's emotional state.'"

	We can have multiple topics active at once. All our active topics together make up our emotional state:
