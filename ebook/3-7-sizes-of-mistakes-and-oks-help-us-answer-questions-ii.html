    Answering more questions using sizes
</h3>

  
<p>
    We can continue using sizes of evaluations to make sense of humor:
</p>
<h4>Why can shows with such wildly different tones generate about equal amounts of humor?</h4>
  <div class="vignette">
      <blockquote>
          <p><narration>Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Office People</book-title>, where an outing to a sushi restaurant makes for a hilarious climactic scene.</narration></p> 
          
          <p><narration>Everyone gets up to head to their coworker's wedding&mdash;but they realize their car keys were accidentally put into the jacket of a businessman! They have to scramble to recover them. It’s a really funny scene.</narration>
                    </p>
                 <p>
                     <narration>Next, Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Animated Guy</book-title>, where the climactic scene is a joust to the death among friends from the tops of limousines. Everyone dies horribly, and it’s really funny. Owen knows that whenever characters die in this show, they’re always back alive in the concluding scene.</narration></p>
                 <p>
                     <narration>Owen thinks both scenes were about equally funny. Which is weird, because they were so tonally different!</narration>

         Title="We can feel intense humor from small evaluations as well as large evaluations as long as they balance"
         Alt="This image combines scales with our evaluation tables. the scale for Animated Guy is balanced with a large mistake box and large OK box. The scale for Office People is balanced with a small mistake box and a small OK box. Both generate intense humor, and are plotted on the evaluations table. This shows that both are on the line of most-intense humor, despite having different sizes of evaluations."

         <p>
         The tone of the show sets the overall OK. If Owen knows that characters can die and be alive again in the next scene, he has a large OK&mdash;which then needs a large mistake <callback>(limousine jousting)</callback> to balance the OK.</p>
         
         <p>
   On the other hand, if Owen relates to more realistic characters in a show with more realistic consequences, then Owen has a smaller OK&mdash;which then needs smaller mistakes <callback>(misplacing car keys)</callback> to balance the OK.</p>
         
         <p>
   This means both shows will have their own sweet spot that generates intense humor&mdash;even though these sweet spots are tonally different.</p>
    

<h4>Why does the genre of something influence the humor we feel from it?</h4>

Title="If we're told a genre, it influences our evaluations"
Alt="This flowchart has a large mistake box labeled 'Voschev was made redundant from the small machine factory where he obtained the means for his existence...', leading either to (1) a small OK box labeled 'we think the book is a tragedy,' which leads to no humor or to (2) a large OK box labeled 'we think the book is a dark comedy,' which leads to humor."

<p>
    The genre influences how we evaluate the size of the mistakes and OKs. If the front of the book said it was a <term>dark comedy</term>
    <callback>("a masterpiece of dark humor")</callback>, we’d be more likely to evaluate the mistakes and OKs in a way that would generate some humor. 
</p>
<p>
    On the other hand, if the front of the book said it was a <term2>dark tragedy</term2> <callback>("a masterpiece of human suffering")</callback>, we may evaluate things so that there was less humor.

    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>
           When we’re not confident in how we’re “supposed” to be evaluating things, we can feel some evaluatory ambiguity. We may oscillate between a big OK and a small OK, which leads to bewilderment or mixed emotional states. <callback>(“I can’t tell if this is hilarious absurdism or unrelievedly grim.”)</callback>
