<p>We can answer the question <callback>"how do I generate humor?"</callback> by cycling through humor outcomes:</p> 
        
        <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
           <li>“How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>”</li>
            <li>"How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>"</li>
            <li>"How do I generate humor? By <humor-outcome>helping someone become accepted</humor-outcome>"</li>
               </ul>   
          <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
        
<p>This lets us take an abstract question <callback>("how do I generate humor?")</callback> and downsize it into something tangible&mdash;since we already know how to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>.</p> 
        
<p>Loosely, we have two different approaches when thinking about generating humor:</p> 

<ul style="list-style: none">
   <li>An <vocab>emotion-first</vocab> approach, which treats a humor outcome as a consequence of humor. <callback>("If they laugh, they'll reach a humor outcome")</callback></li>
    <li>An <vocab>outcome-first</vocab> approach, which treats humor as a consequence of a humor outcome. <callback>("If they reach a humor outcome, they'll laugh")</callback></li>
    </ul>

<p>These two approaches let us talk about the same thing in different ways:</p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
   <li><strong>Emotion-first:</strong> <callback>“If he laughs, I’ll have handled his criticism”</callback></li>
    
    <li><strong>Outcome-first:</strong> <callback>“If I handle his criticism, he’ll laugh”</callback></li>

    alt="This figure has a double-sided arrow linking 'he laughs' on the left to 'I've handled his criticism.' on the right. An arrow approaching things from the left is labeled 'emotion-first thinking' and another from the right is labeled 'outcome-first thinking.'"

    </ul>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
    <li><strong>Emotion-first:</strong> <callback>“If I feel humor, I’ll have dealt with a taboo topic”</callback></li>
    
    <li><strong>Outcome-first:</strong> <callback>“If I deal with a taboo topic, I’ll feel humor”</callback></li>

    <ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">    
            
    <li><strong>Emotion-first:</strong> <callback>“If they feel humor, I’ll have eased their tensions.”</callback></li>
        
    <li><strong>Outcome-first:</strong> <callback>“If they ease their tensions, they’ll feel humor.”</callback></li>

    <p>Essentially, this is like solving <callback>X = Y</callback>&mdash;or, in this case, <callback>X = humor = Y</callback>. We can solve the same equation by approaching either end!</p>
    
<p>If we thought we could <sem-weak>only</sem-weak> solve for X, we'd limit ourselves! When we realize we can <em>also</em> solve for Y, we'll have more flexibility in how we think about different situations.</p>

        If we're welcoming a new person to our team, we know we'll want them to smile or laugh. If we frame our question as "how can we make them smile or laugh" <callback>(emotion-first)</callback>, we'll call to mind things like jokes, funny voices, goofy icebreakers, and so on.</p>
        
        <p>Alternatively, if we frame our question as "how can we <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>" <callback>(outcome-first)</callback>, this calls to mind a different set of things&mdash;maybe a thoughtful gift, individualized time, hospitality, displays of equality, and so on.</p>
            
        <p>By reframing the question to center around humor outcomes, we can think beyond our usual associations and think of other things that produce smiles and laughs when done successfully.</p>
    </aside>
       
    </div>

<p>The point of all this isn't that there are "two ways" of going about generating humor&mdash;the point is to find new perspectives on how we go about taking emotional actions in our lives.</p> 
  
<p>It's also a way of finding synergies from a network of skills. Since all humor outcomes are connected, improving at <humor-outcome>supporting arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealing personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on improves our skill at <emotions>humor</emotions>&mdash;and improving our skill at <emotions>humor</emotions> improves our ability to <humor-outcome>support arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
   
<p>In this sense, a rising tide lifts all boats&mdash;improving at humor makes us better at all these different humor outcomes! This is especially true as we gain greater awareness to when and where and why humor happens.</p>

<p>Humor has triggering conditions. We can think about these conditions narratively with humor outcomes, including using a spatial metaphor to think about how a situation does or doesn't develop toward these triggering conditions.</p>

    Our evaluations are shaped by the direct and indirect participation of everyone. That means that <a href="17-02-everyone-has-influence-in-who-does-or-do-not-feel-humor.html">everyone has a role</a> in whether or not humor outcomes are reached, and on what topics. 
    </li> 
    
    <li>We can generate humor by simply <a href="17-04-we-can-generate-humor-by-only-thinking-about-outcomes.html">focusing</a> on reaching a humor outcomes&mdash;whether or not this strikes us as stereotypically "funny."</li>

        Humor outcomes are something a situation <a href="17-05-humor-is-something-we-work-toward.html">develops toward</a>. This means we sometimes have to take time working toward them. It's sometimes helpful to think of humor as more as a conclusion or destination than as a beginning.
