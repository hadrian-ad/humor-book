	We can also describe moments where mistakes and OK balance as <emotions>acceptance</emotions>. We've seen examples with this context before: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        
        <narration>Timothy calls Jennifer.</narration></p>
            <p><speaker>Timothy:</speaker> <speech>“Jennifer, I know Sam said otherwise, but I checked with the insurance company. They said the treatment is still experimental. They won’t cover it.”</speech>
    </p>
            <p>
            <narration>Jennifer is silent for a second. Then she laughs, exhausted</narration>. <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>acceptance</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
            
    </p>
        <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <speech>“That’s what I thought. If we hold a fundraiser, I think we should still be able to cover it.”</speech>
    </p>
</blockquote>
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
            <narration>Sam is examining his nearly bald head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</narration></p>
            
              <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <speech> <action>*squeezing him* </action>“You look so <em>handsome</em>.”</speech> </p>
              
              <p><narration> Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately.</narration> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>acceptance</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>	
         
    </p>
</blockquote>
    </div>
<p>
	In the examples above, people feel humor when they feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>&mdash;since acceptance describes moments where mistake and OK balance. 
</p>
<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>
            Sam gives a “<em>releasing</em> series of small laughs”&mdash;with <emotions>release</emotions> being another of our humor family words. In this case, we can describe his humor as <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on. These words all work, simultaneously, since they’re all describing the same thing&mdash;humor.
