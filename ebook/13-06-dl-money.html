  <p>Spectator entertainment is often commercialized&mdash;which means that there's a priority for maximizing money somewhere in the production chain. Commercialization gives things design priorities that shape how they turn out.</p> 

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to hotels, since commercialization shapes how hotels are built. For instance, architects are told that the hotel rooms should:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>be easy to clean</li>
    <li>be durable</li>
    <li>be inoffensive</li>
    <li>have an orderly and efficient arrangement</li>
    <li>not be more expensively furnished then necessary</li>
    <li>reduce theft</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This helps us understand part of why hotel rooms look like hotel rooms, and not like someone’s bedroom. In our bedroom, we can put whatever art we like on the walls&mdash;since we're not worried someone will steal it or give them a bad review, like we might if decorating a hotel.</p> 

<p>Something similar happens to when humor is a goal of something commercialized. The commercialization gives design priorities to things like movies or comedians, where the creators may then try to:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>appeal to a broad audience</li>
    <li>be a conventional length</li>
    <li>be accessible to many people</li>
    <li>be reproducible</li>
    <li>fit an advertising model</li>
    <li>not allow disruptive interaction from the audience</li>
    <li>represent the distributor or host</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>This explains in part why a funny clip from a <term>comedy</term> and a funny video from our <term2>partner</term2> aren't similar. In part, that’s because our partner isn’t shaped by any commercial priorities!</p> 

<p>Our partner can focus entirely on us alone, without worrying about whether they'll also appeal to a broad audience or if they'll fit with an advertising model. It's similar to how a residential bedroom can look different than a hotel bedroom&mdash;the goals and priorities are different.</p> 

<p>Our partner can also activate topics specific to just us, in a way a video designed for hundreds of thousands of people can't.</p>


<div class="for-instance">
    <aside class="consider"><consider>For instance:</consider>
        
        <p>If a movie is trying to reach tens of millions of people, it has design priorities that will screen out niche content.</p> 
        
        <p>We won’t see a blockbuster <term>movie</term> that makes a joke about a restaurant in our hometown&mdash;let alone about a gift we once got during a birthday dinner there.</p>
        
        <p>However, our <term2>partner</term2> may activate these topics&mdash;which is one reason people can provide things in conversation that we can't get from things with more commercialized design priorities.</p> </aside>
</div>

<p>We’re often aware of the upsides and downsides of <vocab>scaling</vocab>, like for rented rooms. We intuitively know this when thinking about staying in a three-room Bed &amp; Breakfast or a 1,000 room resort.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <aside class="consider"><consider>For instance:</consider>
        
        <p>The resort may have efficiencies of scale, so their 1,000 rooms can support a water park and commercial kitchens&mdash;while a three-room bed and breakfast can’t.</p> 
        
        <p>At the same time, the resort will be unable to have an entrance that's cozy, delicate, detailed, distinctive, small, textured, unique, and so on&mdash;since there's just too many people coming in and out!</p> </aside></div>

<p>But even though we're used to thinking this way for things like <term>hotels</term>, we sometimes aren't used to thinking this way for <term2>spectator entertainment</term2>&mdash;which is often similar.</p> 
 
 
 <p>A comedic movie for ten million people is very different then a small open mic night for ten listeners&mdash;which is itself different than a conversation with our partner.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider> 
         <p>We may wonder why people may go to local comedy open mics. There are many reasons&mdash;one of which is that we can get local references or characteristics in ways we simply can't from other spectator entertainment!</p>
    </aside>
     </div>
 <p>The point here isn't to say that commercialization or scalability is bad, since it's not&mdash;those things can be good or bad. Instead, the point is to notice the <sem-weak>reasons</sem-weak> that spectator entertainment is the way it is&mdash;and to notice what isn't in spectator entertainment.</p> 
 
 <p>This lets us be thoughtful about how these things relate to our day-to-day lives.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>For instance:</consider>
        
        <p>We may enjoy going to a hotel for a vacation. But just because we enjoyed it doesn't mean hotel rooms are how <em>all</em> bedrooms everywhere should be.</p>
        
        <p>It's the same for comedic books or movies. We may enjoy them&mdash;but at the same time, it's not something that defines how <em>all</em> moments of humor should be everywhere.</p>
