<p>As we increase our attention to each other’s emotional state, we increase the informational tension between them&mdash;forming a connection between them.</p> 
     
<p>This <vocab>human surface tension</vocab> is what makes groups groups:</p>

     <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-information-tension/cl-0-low-high-surface-tension.png
    alt="This image establishes a visual framework for showing surface tension. People, represented by circles, have either small dots around them for low surface tension, or big dots for high surface tension."

    style="max-width: 22rem ; margin-left: ; margin-top: .5rem" 
     >

 

<p>We can see the degrees of human surface tension any time we look at any group of people:</p>

        <p>

    style="max-width: 32rem ; margin-left: 1rem; margin-top: .5rem " 
     >



<p>We increase or decrease this informational tension by how much mutual attention we give each other:</p>

<p>"Grouping" is so normal that it's sometimes hard to even think about. Human surface tension is one way of drawing attention to the connection that groups us, how that connection happens, what it is, and how it changes over time.</p>

<p>It can also more elegantly describe emotion networks and subnetworks:
    </p>

<img src=../images/closer-look/cl-information-tension/cl-7-surface-tension-is-networks.png
    alt="This figure takes our previous image for emotion networks and subnetworks, and replaces them with surface tension diagrams."
    title="Dots more accurately describe emotion network"
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>These groupings are fluid and can quickly change over time&mdash;since we’re constantly changing which people we put effort into sharing and receiving information with.</p> 

<p>We can see arrangements, degrees, and changes of human surface tension whenever we look at anyone. We can see this in some pictures:</p>


<img src=../images/closer-look/cl-information-tension/cl-8-surface-tension-examples.png
    alt="This figure has close-ups of people at tables at a ballroom, and transposes them into surface tension diagrams. People who are disinterested in each other are grouped by small dots, people who are deeply interested are grouped by large dots."

<p>In each of these pictures, the human surface tension is fluid and tangible&mdash;it's the constantly changing degree of informational exchange between people. </p>

<p>Our ability to handle human surface tension is what enables us to form or disband groups. And while this skill is broader than just "humor," it's also essential to any skill around humor.</p>

<p>We can improve our awareness and control of human surface tension&mdash;which in turn enables connective and precise humor with others. That's because it gives us the nuanced information needed to shift mistakes and OKs on various topics to generate mutual humor.</p>

<p>Evaluators radiate their evaluations to other evaluators. This creates a reactive network of evaluations. These emotion networks are the medium where humor happens.</p>

<ul>
   <li>We automatically <a href="10-0-emotion-network.html">join</a> emotion networks whenever we're around others.</li> 
    
   <li>Emotion networks try to <a href="10-2-we-synchronize-with-people-on-our-emotion-network.html">synchronize</a> evaluations. People on emotion networks feel uncomfortable when they can't arrive at a shared evaluatory perspective.</li> 
    
    <li>Emotion networks can be nested within each other. These <a href="10-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks-by-synchronizing.html">subnetworks</a> try to stay synchronized on the sets of topics specific to that subnetwork.</li>
