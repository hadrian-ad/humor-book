Change in humor tells expresses change in intensity
</h3>

<p>We can see how humor tells <term>decrease</term> or <term2>increase</term2> in intensity over time:</p>

title="Moment A"
alt="This photo shows a young man and a woman smiling."

class="photo"
title="Moment B"
alt="This photo is from a later moment from the photo above. Both the man and woman are now laughing and smiling broadly."

<p>The people above go from a medium-intensity humor to a high-intensity humor:</p>

title="Change in intensity of humor"
alt="This evaluation graph has two moments marked from the photos above. Between moment A and moment B, the intensity of humor increases."
style="max-width: 24rem;"

<p>This change in intensity of humor happens through a change in the intensity of their humor tells:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>a <humor-tell>light smile</humor-tell> <em>into</em> a <humor-tell>full smile</humor-tell></li>
    <li>being <humor-tell>somewhat loose</humor-tell> <em>into</em> being <humor-tell>fully loose</humor-tell></li>
    <li><humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell> <em>into</em> <humor-tell>complete loss of situational awareness</humor-tell></li>
    <li><humor-tell>energy</humor-tell> <em>into</em> <humor-tell>more energy</humor-tell></li>
    <li><humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell> <em>into</em> <humor-tell>even more raised spirits</humor-tell></li>
    </ul>
    
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>


   <aside class="box">
         <p><b>Lifecycle.</b> To think about the intensity of a humor tell like a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, we can think about the “life cycle” of a smile. We start with the lowest intensity version of a smile and think about how it progresses into greater intensity:</p>
        
        <ul class="close-list" style="list-style: upper-alpha">
            <li>twinge of muscles in the cheeks, <i>followed by a</i></li>
            <li>twinge of muscles around the eyes, <i>followed by a</i></li>
            <li>twinge of muscles around the lips, <i>followed by</i></li> 
            <li>greater contraction around our eyes, <i>followed by the</i></li>
            <li>edge of our lips pulling outward, <i>followed by our</i></li>
            <li>lips being stretched by our cheeks muscles</li>
            
            </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
        
        <img src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-3-images/8-3-3-scale-smile.png"
        
        title="Lifecycle of a smile"
        alt="This spectrum has the lable 'smile' and shows the man's smile from photo A and photo B. The smile in Photo A is placed onto the spectrum graph at C from the list above. An arrow points from Photo A to Photo B, which is placed on F from the list abave."

        <p>We can do this with any humor tell, which all have a smallest variation that progressively becomes more and more intense.</p>
