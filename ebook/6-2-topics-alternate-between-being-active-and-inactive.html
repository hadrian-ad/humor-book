     Topics alternate between being active and inactive 
</h3>
  
<p>
	We're not evaluating <sem-weak>everything</sem-weak> all the time. Instead, we evaluate a few things for a while, and then switch to evaluate other things.

    <consider>For instance:</consider>
            
            <p>We don’t hear a joke and then spend the rest of our lives continuously evaluating it. Instead, we evaluate the joke for a while and then our attention goes to something else.

    <p>
	When we're paying attention to a topic, we're evaluating it. When we're evaluating a topic, it's <vocab>active</vocab>&mdash;otherwise, that topic is <vocab>inactive</vocab>:

    title="Introducing line of focus"
    alt="This image introduces a line of focus diagram. It has an axis for time, with topics strong along  a line. Where the line is full, the topic is active. Where the line is dotted, the topic is inactive."
    style="max-width:17rem;">

<p>
	We cycle through active topics as our attention changes:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> <narration>Trevor's ears prick as he hears the mail being delivered. It sounds like a big lump of mail today!</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor is making evaluations on topic 'mail,' so that topic is active)</notes>
        </p>
    <p>
        <strong>B.</strong> <narration>Trevor goes back to his game. He has got to find a way to beat the Time Magistrate.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor is no longer making evaluations on topic 'mail,' so that topic becomes inactive)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>

    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-2-topics-alternate-between-being-active-and-inactive/6-2-1-mail-and-game.png"
    title="Line of focus"
    alt="This focus diagram expands on the previous diagram. It has two columns, one labled [1] and another [2]. A legend describes [1] as the topic 'mail' and [2] as the topic 'game.' Along the time axis, there are two marked points, A and B. At A, topic 1 is active, but becomes inactive at B, when topic 2 becomes active."
    style="max-width:19rem;">


<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> <narration>Zoe is watching a video on her phone.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic ‘video’ is active)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>B.</strong> <narration>She’s interrupted by a phone call from her mother.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic ‘Carol’ is active)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>C.</strong> <narration>After hanging up, Zoe goes back to her video.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic ‘video’ is active again)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>
    </div>

    <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-2-topics-alternate-between-being-active-and-inactive/6-2-2-video-and-mom.png"
    title="Line of focus II"
    alt="This focus diagrams expands on the previous diagram by showing focus reactivating a topic. It shows two columns for two topics, 'video' and 'mom.' At A, it shows topic 1 is active, at B topic 2 is active, and at C topic 1 is active again."
    style="max-width:28rem;">


<p>Multiple topics can also be active at the same time:</p>
<div class="vignette">
	<blockquote>
	    <p>
	        <strong>A.</strong> <narration>Emma is eating on the couch when her roommate, Jessica, joins her.</narration> <notes>(&larr; Emma's topic 'Jessica' is active)</notes>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        <strong>B.</strong> <narration>Jessica's boyfriend, Elias, comes out of the bathroom and joins them too.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma's topics 'Jessica' and 'Elias' are active)</notes>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	        <strong>C.</strong> <narration>Elias leaves, and Zoe calls Emma.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma's topics 'Jessica' and 'Zoe' are active)</notes>
	    </p>
	</blockquote>
    </div>
    
        <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-2-topics-alternate-between-being-active-and-inactive/6-2-3-jessica-elias-emma.png"
    title="Line of focus III"
    alt="This focus diagriam expands on previous ones by having three columns for three topics, and showing how multiple topics can be active at once. Column 1 is topic 'Jessica,' column 2 is topic 'Elias,' column 2 is topic 'Emma.' At A, 'Jessica' is active. At B, 'Jessica' and 'Elias' are active. At C, 'Jessica' and 'Emma' are active."
    style="max-width:25rem;">

    
   <aside class="box">
         <p><b>Timeline and presentation.</b> All topics are inactive for periods of time. For instance, even though Zoe's conversation with Ryan was <term>frequently</term> active, it wasn't <term2>always</term2> on her mind all the time.</p>
                
                <p>So if we were to graph both the active and inactive periods of this topic, we'd have gaps between the evaluatory changes, where no evaluation is happening.</p>
            
                <img 
            src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-2-topics-alternate-between-being-active-and-inactive/6-2-4-box-inactive-topics.png"
            title="Connecting evaluation graphs to focus diagrams"
            alt="This image shows an evaluation graph next to a single-topic focus diagram. The evaluation graph has dotted lines where the topic isn't active and evaluation isn't occuring. This is shown on the focus diagram where the topic goes through periods of inactivity."
            style="max-width:35rem; margin-top: .5rem">
            
            <p>
        To keep our informal graphs easy to read at a glance, we'll usually ignore these inactive periods.
