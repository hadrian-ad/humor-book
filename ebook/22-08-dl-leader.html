<p>We sometimes think that we should <em>rationalize</em> humor or humor dress codes&mdash;perhaps through lists of permitted and forbidden content. But this misunderstands humor and emotions more generally.</p>

  <p>We know we can’t verbally promise ourselves that we won’t be angry or sad next week&mdash;or sign a binding contract that we’ll only feel happiness next week. These promises or contracts wouldn’t do anything!</p> 

<p>For the same reason we can't sign a contract like this with <term>ourselves</term>, we can't force <term2>others</term2> to sign a contract. We can’t control emotion dress codes in this way!</p>

            <p>This doesn’t stop people from trying&mdash;like during the French revolution, when the constitutional assembly formally banned laughter at their meetings.</p> 
               
            <p>But laughter continued, and there really wasn’t anything formal rules could do about it. They could <term>enforce</term> the rule, but not reach inside and <term2>change</term2> people's underlying evaluatory system.
            </p>
            
            <p>Charitably, their goal was to become more effective, deliberative, grave, rational, and so on&mdash;but interestingly, an unfollowable rule brought them further away from all of those thing!</p> </aside>
        </aside>
</div>

<p>Even though we can't control emotional dress codes by dictate, people still try all the time:</p>



<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <narration>Stephen calls an all-staff meeting.</narration>
        </p>
        
        <p><speaker>Stephen:</speaker> <speech>“There will be no laughing during all-hands meeting. None. Got it? We’re going to spend the rest of the hour figuring out what’s happening in research. We don’t have time for nonsense.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Stephen tries to set a dress code in advance)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>



<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <narration>Tucker calls an all-staff meeting.</narration>
        </p>
        
        <p><speaker>Tucker:</speaker> <speech>“Now I want us to have fun. We have to laugh. No frown-y faces. C’mon everyone. Let’s laugh. Ha ha ha! Amber, why don’t you start us off with a joke? Anything goes!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Tucker tries to set a dress code in advance)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>


<p>Stephen is trying to set the dress code so high that any humor would be seen as unfitted <callback>(and so seen as justifiably censurable)</callback>&mdash;Tucker wants to set it so low that any humor or humor attempt would be fitted <callback>(and so <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast>  justifiably censurable)</callback>.</p> 

<p>The problem is that dress codes aren’t something Stephen or Tucker have centralized control over.</p>

<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>This is obvious with something like anger. We can't just wave our hands to set what things people around us see as justifiably infuriating.</p> 
       
    <p>We can't control the <term>anger</term> dress code for the same reason we can't control the <term2>humor</term2> dress code.</p>
</aside>
    </div>

<p>When we think we should be able to set dress codes unilaterally, we don't just treat others as inferiors&mdash;we won’t succeed either!</p>

<p>If we want to raise a dress code, everyone around us will need to have a non-theoretical reason for increased efficiency and cohesion.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>It’s not enough for <term>Stephen</term> to feel a need for efficiency and cohesion&mdash;since the dress code is set by <term>everyone</term>. In a room of twenty people, Stephen is only 1/20th of the opinion on this.</p>
        
        <p>The dress code won't raise until <term2>everyone</term2> present <term2>also</term2> agrees on the need for increased efficiency and cohesion.</p>
    </aside>
    </div>

<p>At best, Stephen could try to <term>censor</term>&mdash;rather than <term2>censure</term2>&mdash;humor. He could try to force people to behave <em>as if</em> the dress code was a certain way. But this is a bit like making people enjoy his birthday party at gunpoint&mdash;the picture of what he wants only.</p>

<p>If the staff is intimidated, they may <term>censor</term> (not <term2>censure</term2>) themselves the way Stephen wants&mdash;but this is different than him actually setting the dress code for them. Stephen would just be compelling behavior, not changing what others internally recognize as fitted or unfitted.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
         <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>Teachers often do this with students. When students don't feel any need for efficiency or cohesion, they lower their dress code and goof off without censuring each other.</p> 
        
        <p>Instead of <term>addressing</term> the cause of their lower dress code <callback>(boredom, lack of perceived need for efficiency or cohesion)</callback>, the teacher tries to <term2>force</term2> them to not goof off <callback>(censor)</callback>. The teacher is trying to enforce a dictated dress code in a way that goes against how dress codes are actually set.</p>
        
        
            <p>Sometimes teachers think classes need to get serious <callback>(raise a dress code)</callback> before they get started&mdash;but this is often backwards. We actually need to get started before we get serious!</p> 
            
            <p>That's because moving into an activity that requires greater cohesion and efficiency will <term>naturally</term> raise the dress code&mdash;while simply yelling at people to knock it off tries to ineffectively <term2>force</term2> a dress code through censoring.</p>
    </aside>
</div>
    
    
    <p>Sometimes, we have the incomplete perspective that humor is counterproductive. The problem with this is that <term>fitted</term> humor is by <term2>definition</term2> productive&mdash;it’s doing many things at once, in a way that meets the current minimum standard.</p>


<p>If we can't distinguish between fitted and unfitted humor, and so tried to censure <em>all</em> humor, we'd be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Removing all humor would be a solution that creates problems.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        
            <consider>Consider:</consider>
            <p>Sometimes we think we can get rid of dress codes, like if we go to an anything goes basement comedy club show, an unmoderation forum, or so on. But that’s an illusion: any group of people will always form dress codes.</p> 
            
            <p>This is why an audience that's hungry for taboo jokes will still censure annoying laughter or comments from within the audience, or why members of a boundary-pushing forum will still censure people making fun of members a certain way.</p> 
            
            <p> That's because humor dress codes haven't gone away, and those audiences haven't been exempted from the normal process that sets them.</p> 
            
            <p>The same thing is true for people who try to <sem-weak>raise</sem-weak> a dress code instead of lowering them. Simply saying a topic is off-limits doesn't stop us from finding fitted humor attempts on that topic fitted.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>When we understand how dress codes work, we can better influence them or make sense of why people are behaving the way they are.

      <p>When we see people having fun when we think they should be serious, or being serious where we think they should be having fun, we don't <em>only</em> need to be frustrated&mdash;since their dress code gives us insight into how they’re seeing the world around them.</p>

<p>This in turn lets us make changes to our approach to people in ways that accords with how people work. We can recognize this being done by the genuine emotional leaders we know in our lives. Instead of being in conflict with how we work, they lead by being in harmony with it.</p>

<p>When humor or a humor attempt is below the humor dress code, it's vulnerable to <vocab>censure</vocab>.</p>


<ul>

    <li>The dress code is the line where two <a href="22-01-we-feel-itss-justified-to-censure-unfitted-humor.html">competing measures meet</a>: the justification for censure, and the justification for humor or the humor attempt. The dress code is the line where one justification becomes larger than the other.</li>
    
    <li>We can <a href="22-02-we-experience-this-all-the-time.html">censure</a> humor or humor attempts that fall below the humor dress code. The amount of censure we tolerate is proportional to the deficiency of fittedness to the situation's dress code.
    </li>
    
    <li>We experience desynchronization as <a href="22-03-we-synchronize-toward-fittedness.html">censure</a>. This is part of a calibratory system that is often gentle or bonding&mdash;censure only occasionally becomes confrontational or high stakes.</li>
