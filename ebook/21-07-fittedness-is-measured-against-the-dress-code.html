    <h3 id="21-07">Comparing fittedness to dress code</h3>
   
<p>We can put everything together to look at a few examples:
</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the used bookstore for fun.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe doesn't need to be particularly efficient or cohesive&harr;&#xFE0E;browsing has low dress code)</notes></p> 
        
        <p><narration>She finds a book called <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title>.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor attempt with low fittedness)</notes></p> 
        <p><narration>She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;low dress code and low fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;fitted humor)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
    
  <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-00-dress-codes/browsing-zoe-ferdydurke.png

    alt="This dress code figure is labeled 'browsing' and shows a small bar that exceeds a very low dress code.";
    title="Dress code figure I";
    style="max-width: 20rem ; margin-left: 1rem" 
     >
    
    <div class="vignette">
    
   <blockquote>
         <p><narration>Owen is writing an email to Justin. For fun, he writes</narration> <speech>“He cries FERDYDURKE!”</speech> in the subject lines</p>
        
        <p><narration>Justin is amused and annoyed. Why doesn’t anyone ever read the email etiquette guidelines on the syllabus?</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen and Justin disagree on the humor dress code)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
    
    <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-00-dress-codes/owen-justin-emailing.png

    alt="There are two dress code figures, each with a small bar of fittedness. The left, labeled 'Owen,' exceeds the low dress code, while the right, labeled 'Justin,' falls far short of the dress code.";
    title="Dress code figure II";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: 2rem" 
     >
 
<p>Above, there was disagreement on what the humor dress code should be, and so end up with different views on whether the subject line was fitted.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>Justin has to juggle emails from all twenty-five students&mdash;Owen just has to juggle emails from one professor. It's not surprising they have different initial estimates of efficiency and cohesion needs.

<p>Tucker’s <term>pun</term> had a <term>low</term> fittedness, since it wasn't on relevant topics and wasn’t trying to reach humor family words. Amber only thought it was fitted when there was a low dress code.</p> 

<p>By contrast, Tucker’s <term2>affirmation</term2> had a <term2>high</term2> fittedness, since it was on relevant topics and was trying to make Amber feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>Because the affirmation had a high fittedness, Amber thought it fit the emotional situation <em>whether or not</em> there was a high or low dress code.</p>
 
 
<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Context.</headline> Sometimes we're surprised that humor attempts are recieved differently in different places&mdash;we think there should be a flat dress code everywhere.</p> 
            
            <p>It's worth noticing that this gives a double standard for <sem-weak>humor</sem-weak> that we don't give to other emotions. We're not surprised that an erotic photo or a long rant are treated one way in one situation, and another way in another.</p> 
            
            <p>For the same reason, we shouldn't be surprised that jokes or humor attempts are treated differently in one situation than another.</p>
