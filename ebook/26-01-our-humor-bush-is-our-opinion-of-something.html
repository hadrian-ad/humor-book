<h3 id="26-01">Our opinion is our humor bush</h3>

<p>When people have different opinions of Seattle, the difference is accounted in their humor bushes:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“I went to Seattle last summer! I <sem-weak>love</sem-weak> Seattle!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s opinion of Seattle)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <speech>“I <sem-weak>lived</sem-weak> there for eighteen years. I… like it.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh’s opinion of Seattle)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Well I <sem-weak>hate</sem-weak> Seattle.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s opinion of Seattle)</notes> <speech>“I was trapped in a Greyhound station there for like twelve hours overnight once. One of the worst experiences of my life!”</speech></p>
    </blockquote>

    alt="This image has circles of time for each character. Each circle has different amounts of humor in it. These humor bushes correspond with their opinion of seattle."

<p>When Emma says she loves Seattle and Owen says he hates it, they’re not arguing about the merits of Seattle’s:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>strong mayoral system</li>
    <li>growth opportunities in their retail market</li>
    <li>economic data of the middle quintile of residents</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>Instead, Emma loves how she <sem-weak>feels</sem-weak> about Seattle&mdash;just like Owen hates how he <sem-weak>feels</sem-weak> about Seattle. They’re both describing their humor bush with Seattle.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>When Emma visited Seattle, she felt she <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> created rapport (with herself or the city)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> gained new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>constantly</outcome-contrast> avoided conflict (with herself or others while travelling)</humor-outcome>, felt <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> able to become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>constantly</outcome-contrast> symbolized close ties (with herself, the city, the world)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
        
         
        
        <p>By contrast, Owen felt he <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> created rapport (with himself or the city)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> gained new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>couldn’t</outcome-contrast> avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> symbolized close ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<p>Emma visited Seattle for a <term>vacation</term>&mdash;it was a short time period that was filled with interesting and novel experiences. This gave her a large humor bush.</p>



<p>By contrast, Minh <term2>lived</term2> there&mdash;it was a long time period that was filled with less straightforwardly enjoyable things. This gives Minh a smaller overall humor bush than Emma:

alt="This image shows different size circles filled with humor. Emma and Minh have the same number of humor dots, but different sized circles. Emma, with a smaller circle, has a larger humor bush."
     title="Opinion figure"
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: "

<p>Since Minh’s humor bush with Seattle is smaller than Emma, his opinion of the city is less positive than Emma's opinion&mdash;but not as low as Owen’s opinion.</p>

 

 <aside class="box">
     <p><b>Dilution.</b> Our opinion of a topic or topics is the amount of humor they generate&mdash;the humor bush for that topic.</p> 
     
     <p>As a tourist, Emma has <term>one</term> topic she attributes all humor to&mdash;'Seattle.' This superloads this topic with humor, leading to a large humor bush.</p>
     
     <p>By contrast, as a resident, Minh has <term2>many</term2> active topics he can attribute his humor to. Instead of pooling all his humor into 'Seattle,' he distributes it across many topics&mdash;his neighborhood, his home, his school, a shop, and so on, while an abstract general topic like 'Seattle' may end up with a relatively small humor bush.</p>

     <p>This is why Minh may light up when his home street is mentioned <callback>(large humor bush)</callback>&mdash;while not neccessarily attributing it to 'Seattle' in general <callback>(medium humor bush)</callback>.</p>
