    What do we mean by "mistake"?
</h2>

       <p>
    The first part of our humor pattern is a <vocab>mistake</vocab>.    </p>
   
    <p class="lesson">
        Humor is a <i>mistake</i> that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In this book, a "mistake" is something we aren't expecting:</p>

    The examples above aren’t examples of <term>humor</term>&mdash;they're just examples of what we're calling <term2>mistakes</term2>. Mistakes are just <sem-weak>one part</sem-weak> of our pattern of humor. 
    </p>


<div class="consider">
    
  <aside class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>
            We labeled mistakes above based on the perspective of the people <em>in</em> the examples. The <term>characters</term> thought they were mistakes&mdash;which may or may not match what we, as <term2>readers</term2>, feel are mistakes. We’ll do this throughout this book.
            </p>
    </aside>
</div>


<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Expectations.</headline> 
         A more formal term for a "mistake" would be a <vocab>deviation from our expectations</vocab>. We have <term>expectations</term> for how things should be, and sometimes things <term2>deviate</term2> from those expectations.
         </p>
         
             <p>
     This isn't about whether something is good or bad&mdash;instead, it's about whether something conforms to our expectations.
     </p>
        
        <div class="for-instance">
        <aside class="consider">
<consider>For instance:</consider>
            <p>
                 Since we expect an egg to have <term>one</term> yolk, it’s a deviation from our expectations to find an egg with <term2>two</term2> yolks&mdash;or an egg with <term2>no</term2> yolk.</p> 
                 
                 <p>Similarly, if we thought we knew the <term>billing</term>, it’s a deviation from our expectations to get an unexpected <term2>fee</term2>&mdash;or get an unexpected <term2>discount</term2>.
                 </p>
            <p>
                 It doesn’t matter whether we feel these deviations from our expectations are good or bad. A mistake is when our expectations don't match what we actually encounter.
                 </p>
        </aside>
     </div>
        <p>
     For now, we’ll be using these terms interchangeably <callback>(mistake = deviation from our expectations)</callback>. We’ll mostly use “mistake,” since it’s shorter and less cumbersome.
