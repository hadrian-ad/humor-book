            <deeper-title>Scales of Humor</deeper-title>
            </h4>

    <p>At this point, we’ve gone over the five interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor in this book.</p> 
    
    <p>These are different scales of looking at humor&mdash;from the <term>highest</term> scale <callback>(the general word “humor”)</callback> to the <term2>smallest</term2> scale <callback>(“mistakes and OKs”)</callback>:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Humor as an overall pattern <callback>(“humor”)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as experiences <callback>(humor family words)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as actions, intentions, or consequences <callback>(humor outcomes)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as expressive behavior <callback>(humor tells)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as information-assessments <callback>(mistakes and OKs)</callback></li>
    </ul>
    
         <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-0-pyramid.png

    alt="This pyramid is divided into five sections. At top is humor (overall pattern), then humor family words (situation  or states), humor outcomes (actions), humor tells (behavior) and finally mistakes and OKs (assessments)"
    title="Assembly of humor"
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

 
<p>These are all different scales of talking about the same thing.</p>

<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
         <p> We pick a scale or scales to focus on based on what's useful to us. Sometimes we want to pull back for a bigger picture view, and other times we want to zoom in for smaller details.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome&mdash;like how <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>relaxed posture</humor-tell> compose <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>:</p>

      <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-1-tells-into-outcomes.png

    alt="This molecule figure has three humor tell dots: loosening, social integration, and relaxed posture. They are arranged into a triangle with the dots as points, forming a humor outcome 'ease tension'"
    title="Molecule figure"
    style="max-width: 22rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word&mdash;like how <humor-outcome>eased tensions</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>survival of a high stress environment</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome>changing negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome> compose <emotions>relief</emotions>:</p>

     <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-2-outcomes-into-family-word.png

    alt="This molecule figure has three humor outcomes, represented by the triangle figure of compounded humor tells, forming an even larger triangle of a humor family word. In this way, negative emotions changed into positive ones, easing tensions, surviving a high stress environment, all compound into a 'relief' molecule."
    title="Molecule figure II"
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or the word humor:</p>

    <p>These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to growing our intuitive understanding of things. And sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales of humor for a greater range of perspective.</p>

Humor can be described as actions or outcomes. This lets us think narratively about humor using more ordinary language.</p>

<ul>
   <li>We'll use an arbitrarily limited list of <a href="15-01-list-of-humor-outcomes.html">humor outcomes</a> in this book: <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieve catharsis</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>change negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tensions</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>give new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>help one become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open up a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personality trait</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>survive in high stress situations</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>.</li> 
    
   <li>Since humor outcomes <em>are</em> humor, humor outcomes also have <a href="15-05-humor-outcomes-intensity.html">intensity and duration</a>.</li> 
    
    <li>Humor outcomes all <a href="15-06-humor-outcomes-multiples.html">overlap and redescribe</a> the same thing: humor. That means we can use any humor outcomes, which help us see emotional situations in new light.</li>
