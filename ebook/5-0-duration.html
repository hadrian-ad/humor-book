	We can describe and predict the duration of humor using the same ideas we looked at <a href="../4chapter-continuity/4-0-continuity.html">last chapter</a>: the duration of humor is however long the mistakes and OKs are close to matching in size: 
</p>
    <img
    src="../images/5c-images-duration/5-0-duration/5-0-0-duration-introduction.png"
    title="The duration of humor is as long as mistakes and OKs are close enough to generate humor"
    alt="This evaluation graph shows three lines: one for size of OK and mistake, and one for intensity of humor. Where the lines for OK and mistake meet, the intensity grows. The duration is the length of this balancing of evaluations."
    style="max-width:32rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
<p>
	We’ll be looking at the duration of humor for the rest of this chapter.
</p>
    
    <aside class="box">
        <p><headline>Emotions and durations.</headline> All emotions have a duration to them&mdash;like how grief or irritation can last for a split second, a minute, an hour, a day, a month, and so on.
                 </p>
        <p>But if we're sad all day, that doesn't mean we're sobbing for twenty hours straight. Instead, the <term>intensity</term> of sadness <term2>increases</term2> and <term2>decreases</term2> over the course of the day. <sem-weak>If</sem-weak> our sadness crests into crying, it'll eventually pull back and continue at a lower intensity.</p>
        
        <p>It’s the same for humor. When we feel humor all day, that doesn't mean we're laughing non-stop for twenty hours straight. Instead, the intensity of humor increases and decreases over the course of the day&mdash;and <sem-weak>if</sem-weak> it crests into laughing, it'll eventually pull back and continue at a lower intensity:</p>
        
        <img 
        src="../images/5c-images-duration/5-0-duration/5-0-1-duration-box.png"
        title="Duration of humor is more than just laughter"
        alt="This evaluation graph shows the intensity of humor growing, cresting, and declining over time. It points out that at the crest is loud laughter, but at the start and ends are things like talking excitedly or bouncing. We should include all parts of the rise and fall of intensity of humor as part of the duration of humor, and not just focus on loud laughter. "
        style="max-width:25rem; margin-top 1rem;">
        
            <p>
            Any peak of humor will be bookended by less intense humor. To think about the duration of humor, we'll have pay close attention to the bookending moments of humor peaks.
