       <p>We can use a humor bush to think about why our partner likes us so much, and vice versa&mdash;even if neither of us has ever cured a disease, modeled underwear, won an Olympic medal, or so on. This helps answer a question: if we can compare everyone to everyone, why would anyone still like anyone?</p>
       
        <p>We already know the answer! Those metric comparisons are neither here nor there to our overall opinion. Instead, our overall opinion is based on our humor bush with them.</p>
         
         <p>People feel bonded when they mutually and frequently feel intense feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. In other words, they're bonded when they have a large mutual humor bush! 
         
         <p>We emotionally orient toward the things we have large humor bushes with, including our partner and friends&mdash;and having a large mutual humor bush is the same thing as two people having a high mutual opinion of each other.</p> 
       
       <p>This process is independent of any metric comparisons we could chose to make, which is why people everywhere love other people&mdash;not for their comparative successes, but for the positive emotional experiences they have with each other.</p> 
        
       <p>This is why people tend to say that "humor" is their most important trait in a partner. <callback>(“someone I can laugh with,”</callback> <callback>“someone who makes me laugh,”</callback> <callback>“someone to be weird with together,”</callback> <callback>“someone with a great sense of humor,” and so on.)</callback> We foremost want a humor bush with someone!</p>
       
       <p>We can expand how we think about this using humor family words too. If we say we want <callback>"someone who accepts me,"</callback> <callback>"someone I feel safe with,"</callback> <callback>"someone I feel comfortable around,"</callback> this is <em>also</em> a focus on humor, since feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on are also humor.</p> 
       
       <p>We develop positive opinions this way with romantic partners&mdash;but also with friends, coworkers, neighborhoods, apartment complexes, online gaming lobbies, yarn stores, and so on. That's because these positive opinions all happen the same way&mdash;through cumulative experiences of humor.</p>
              
<h5>Promotion in relationships</h5>
            <p>We looked at comedy <callback>(prioritizing intensity)</callback>, charm <callback>(prioritizing fittedness)</callback>, and <a href="25-09-dl-promotion.html">promotion</a> <callback>(prioritizing status)</callback>.</p>
            
            <p>We sometimes prioritize status when considering romantic partners, instead of fittedness or intensity of humor. When we do this, we don't judge a partner by whether we feel <emotions>connection</emotions> and <emotions>delight</emotions> with each other&mdash;but on whether we think they're status-increasing or not.</p> 
            
            <p>We may hear or think statements like <callback>“we would look so good together,” “I want someone my parents would approve of,” “they're someone who will impress my friends,”</callback> and so on.</p> 
            
            <p>When we <sem-weak>prioritize</sem-weak> increasing a status-metric, we fall into metric comparisons&mdash;which by themselves do not predict good experiences, and are vulnerable to the endless variety of metric comparisons that may float around at different times.</p> 
            
            <p>People who prioritize status instead of prioritize a mutual humor bush often end up with brittle relationships, where their opinions of each other can quickly sour&mdash;since those relationships weren't grounded on a large mutual humor bush, but something more friable.</p> 
            
            <p>The same thing can happen anytime there's promotion chosen over a humor bush&mdash;whether a partner, job, style, activity, and so on.</p>

<p>We emotionally orient toward positive emotional experiences&mdash;which means we can use humor over time as a proxy for our overall opinion of something.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>
     We have a <a href="26-01-our-humor-bush-is-our-opinion-of-something.html">higher overall opinion</a> of something we felt more humor over time with. 
     </li>
    
    <li>
    Our overall opinion of something comes from the <a href="26-02-fitted-humor-makes-up-our-opinion-of-something.html">presence</a> of humor family words, humor outcomes, and humor tells&mdash;which we can aggregate over time. 
    </li>
    
    <li>Our opinions are based on our fitted humor with something, not simply a comparison of <a href="26-10-our-opinion-isnt-same-thing-as-comparison.html">arbitrary metrics</a>.</li>
