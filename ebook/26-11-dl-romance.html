       <p>We can use a humor bush to think about why our partner likes us so much, and vice versa&mdash;even if neither of us has ever cured a disease, modeled underwear, or won an olympic medal. If we can compare everyone to everyone, why would people still like each other?</p>
       
        <p>We already know the answer! Those metric comparisons are neither here nor there to our overall opinion. Instead, our overall opinion is based on our humor bush with them.</p>
         
         <p>People bond when they mutually and frequently feel intense feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. In other words, when they have a large mutual humor bush! 
         
         <p>We emotionally orient toward the things we have a large humor bushes with, including our partner and friends. Having a large mutual humor bush is the same thing as two people having a high mutual opinion of each other.</p> 
       
       <p>This process is independent of any metric comparisons we could chose to make, which is why people everywhere love other people&mdash;not for their comparative successes, but for the positive emotional experiences they have with each other.</p> 
        
       <p>This is why people tend to say that "humor" is their most important trait in a partner. <callback>(“someone I can laugh with,”</callback> <callback>“someone who makes me laugh,”</callback> <callback>“someone to be weird with together,”</callback> <callback>“someone with a great sense of humor,” and so on)</callback> We formost want a humor bush with someone!</p>
       
       <p>We can expand how we think about this using humor family words too. If we say we want <callback>"someone who accepts me,"</callback> <callback>"someone I feel safe with,"</callback> <callback>"someone I feel comfortable around,"</callback> this is <em>also</em> humor focus, since feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on are also humor.</p> 
       
       <p>We develop positive opinions this way with romantic partners&mdash;but also with friends, coworkers, neighborhoods, apartment complexes, online gaming lobbies, yarn stores, and so on. That's because these positive opinions all happen the same way, through cumulative experiences of humor.</p>
              
    <div class="consider">
                 <consider>Consider:</consider>
                  
            <p>We looked at comedy <callback>(prioritizing intensity)</callback>, charm <callback>(prioritizing fittedness)</callback>, and <a href="../19chapter-humor-bushes/19-08-humor-bushes-are-mutual-or-asymmetric.html">promotion</a> <callback>(prioritizing status)</callback>.</p>
            
            <p>We sometimes prioritize status when considering romantic partners, not fittedness or intensity of humor. That means we don't judge a partner as good or bad not on whether we feel <emotion>connection</emotion> and <emotion>delight</emotion> with each other&mdash;but on whether we think they're status-increasing or not.</p> 
            
            <p>We may hear or think statements like <callback>“we would look so good together,” “I want someone my parents would approve of,” “they're someone who will impress my friends,”</callback> and so on.</p> 
            
            <p>But when we <sem-weak>prioritize</sem-weak> increasing a status-metric, we fall into metric-comparisons&mdash;which by themselves do not predict good experiences, and are vulnerable to the dizzying variety of metric-comparisons that may float around at different times.</p> 
            
            <p>People who don't prioritize a mutual humor bush often end up with brittle relationships, where their opinions of each other can quickly sour&mdash;since those relationships weren't grounded on a large mutual humor bush, but something more friable.</p> </div></div>

<p>We emotionally orient toward positive emotional experiences&mdash;which means we can proxy our overall opinion of something using a humor bush.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>
     When presented between two things, we'll have a higher overall opinion of the one we have a larger humor bush with. 
     </li>
    
    <li>
    Our overall opinion of something comes from the presence of humor family words, humor outcomes, and humor tells&mdash;which over time we can aggregate as a humor bush. 
    </li>
    
    <li>
    Our overall opinion is different than a metric comparison. Our overall opinion can be good or bad even when we can compare certain elements of that thing in various ways. We can have a good opinion of a slice of pizza, even if someone points out that it was more expensive than our last slice of pizza&mdash;since comparatize cost is something different than our overall opinion of that experience.
