<p>Since we grew up with words like "humor" and "emotions," we often find it hard to imagine a world without them&mdash;a bit like imagining a world without words like "tree" or "clouds."</p>

<p>But surprisingly, <em>both</em> <term>humor</term> and <term2>emotions</term2> are relatively new words. Their modern meanings didn't actually exist for most of history in any language.</p>

<p>Let's go over a quick history of both of these words:</p>


<h5>Humor</h5>
<p>"Humor" originally meant <callback>"juice of a plant or animal."</callback> So we can squeeze the humors from apples <callback>(apple juice)</callback>, and squirrels are full of squirrel humors.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>
         <p>
             Words like <sem-weak>humor, humid, humidify, humidor, humus,</sem-weak> and so on all share the same root&mdash;of <callback>"moist, wet."</callback>
         </p>
    </aside>
     </div>    
<p>Humor didn't have any association with laughter at all&mdash;for the same reason <callback>"juice"</callback> doesn't have association with laughter today.</p>

<p>It wasn't until just a few hundred years ago that the word "humor" started being used not for <term>laughter</term> specifically but for <term2>emotions</term2> generally. That's when the word "humor" was used by English-speakers as terminology for popular personality modeling systems. <callback>(The four humors, or four fluids.)</callback></p>
        
<p>Eventually, the combinations of fluids <callback>(humor<outcome-contrast>s</outcome-contrast> specifically)</callback> was seen as an extraneous step, and "humor" started to directly mean something like "malleable medium of disposition" <callback>(humor generally)</callback>&mdash;often with a capricious subtext. <callback>("The king's humor," "The baby was in bad humor yesterday, but is in good humor today!”)</callback></p>

<p>Over the next two hundred years or so, the meaning of humor shifted from "the malleable medium of disposition" into all the things it also means today.</p>

<p>These overlapping modern meanings of "humor" tend to relate to laughter from different angles&mdash;including <callback>"laughter,"</callback> <callback>"cause of laughter,"</callback> <callback>"weirdness associated with what sometimes causes laughter,"</callback> <callback>"laughter associated with weirdness,"</callback> <callback>"jokes in general,"</callback> <callback>"interpersonal ability to generate laughter,"</callback> <callback>"a feeling associated with laughter,"</callback> and so on.</p> 

<p>These modern meanings coexist with older meanings, making the word a very broad tent&mdash;a word that shrunk from a general meaning to a more specific one, before expanding again.</p> 
  
<div class="for-instance">
    <aside class="consider"><consider>For instance:</consider>
                    
        <p>We can feel the presence of this history with the word humor, since the word can still carry poetic notes of sadness, madness, rejection, capriciousness, emotional medium, energy, and so on. <callback>("The sisters were instilled with periodic bouts of plaintive humor.")</callback></p> </aside>
    
</div>

<!--
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p>It's easy to look down on the "four humors" as nonsense. However, it's also worth not giving the past a double standard&mdash;it's not that different from personality modeling systems today. We know from our own time that these systems have language that have become inescabable <callback>(extrovert, introvert)</callback> no matter what we think of them or their original systems.</p>
    
    <p>In the same way, humorous <callback>("juice")</callback> words like "melancholy" or "sanquine" also became inescapable as a shared idiom in previous centuries, which doesn't immediately tell us what individuals would have thought about systems those words came from.</p> 
    
    <p>Finally, we can think of more charitable interpretations. If we think of "humor" as not literally "juice," but metaphorically "flavor" or "tone"&mdash;we arrive at gentler understanding of their language.</p> </div>
-->

<h5>Emotion</h5> 
<p>The word “emotion” was originally just a variation of the word “motion.” Like <term>(e)rupture</term> and <term>rupture</term>, <term2>(e)motion</term2> was just <term2>motion</term2> with an emphatic or expelling <sem-weak>e-</sem-weak> in front. 

<p>This is why early uses of emotion were about <em>motion</em>:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>an earthquake was (e)motion in the ground <callback>(the ground shakes, has motion)</callback></li>
    <li>an audience pouring out of the stadium was (e)motion in the crowd <callback>(they moved together, com-motion)</callback></li>
    <li>a letter could cause a reader’s (e)motion <callback>(like pacing, from internal feelings)</callback></li></ul> 

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>


<p>From there, the word eventually developed into its current sense of <callback>“cogitated feelings, especially strong ones (that cause movement or expressive action).”</callback></p>


<div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
         <aside class="consider">    
    <p>In an essay from 1904, we can see a middle point in the development of the word:</p>
               
    <p><q>I was able to walk on, but very slowly, so strongly was I still possessed by the interior emotion.</q></p>
    
    <p>The reference to an "interior" emotion is dated and redundant: unlike in 1904, today there are <em>only</em> interior "emotions".</p>
    </aside>
     </div>

<p>Sometimes, we use the word “emotion” expansively beyond movement&mdash;like to refer to all inner life. But when we look, we can see the meaning of “emotion” constantly drifting back to motion.</p>
       
  <p>If a director says <callback>“let’s do the scene again, this time with more EMOTION!”</callback>&mdash;they don’t mean more vivid internal sensations. The director mean more <sem-weak>emoting</sem-weak>, more expressive action in the body and face. </p>
   
<p>Similarly, we call cats emotionless, not because cats don't have feelings, moods, opinions, personality, preferences, reactions, and so on, because they obviously do&mdash;but because their faces don’t move. Cats can’t emote in the same way dogs can with their moving <callback>(emotional)</callback> faces. </p>

<div class="consider">
   
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
   
    <aside class="consider">
        <p>It's the same for people. When a novelist describes someone as "standing emotionless" they often mean they have a stony poker face <callback>("motionless")</callback>&mdash; not that there's nothing happening inside them.</p>
    </aside>
    
    <!--
    <p>Similarly, we think of stormy seas and blowing trees as emotional, where it's the motion that gives power to the analogy to human emotion.  </p>
-->
</div>
  
 <!--   
 <p>This association with movement is one reason emotion sometimes struggles to encompass everything we want it to&mdash;including things like intentions due to mood or tone of reflections. </p>
 --> 

<h5>The shift</h5>
<p>One reason "humor" and "emotion" took on their new meanings was because of a  metaphor&mdash;the metaphor that <term>reactions and interpretations</term> were <term2>liquid</term2>. This metaphor that caught several words in its wake, and gave them new meanings.</p>

<p>Since <term>humors</term> <callback>(liquids)</callback> were particularly <term2>emotional</term2> <callback>(fluid)</callback>, these two words, humor and emotion, changed together from literally describing <term>fluids</term> and <term>movement</term> to metaphorically describing <term2>cause of laughter</term2> and <term2>feelings</term2>.</p>  

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>We have plenty of remnants of this metaphor cluster, like when we talk about emotions as something we are <sem-weak>"filled with"</sem-weak> that can be <sem-weak>"let out"</sem-weak> or <sem-weak>"expelled" <callback>(emoted)</callback>.</sem-weak></p>
        
        <p>
            This way of speaking wouldn't have had as much power with older ways of describing experiences. In the Latin language, emotions were described with <callback>affect</callback>. Affect meant <sem-weak>"to have done to,"</sem-weak> <sem-weak>"to have been connected in such a way."</sem-weak>
        </p>
        
        <p>If a view affected us <callback>(with beauty)</callback>, there's nothing to expel or let out&mdash;since their model of experiences and evaluations was not based on a metaphor of internal fluids, but external influence.</p> </aside>
    
    </div>    <!--
    <p>These metaphors replaced the Latin word for emotion <callback>(affect)</callback>, which meant <sem-weak>"to have done to,"</sem-weak> <sem-weak>"to have been connected in such a way."</sem-weak></p> 
    
    <p>The replacement of <term>affect</term> <callback>(done to us; out-to-in)</callback> with <term2>emotions/humor</term2> <callback>(happens within us; in-to-out)</callback> also upturned and outdated many traditional affect-affilated words, like <sem-weak>merry</sem-weak> <callback>(something that causes enjoyement out-to-in, "merry weather")</callback>.</p>
-->
        



<p>The point of all this isn't to chase history so much as it is  to give us some distance from the modern meanings of these words. These words dominate how we think about ourselves&mdash;even when they're often confusing! </p> 

<p>When we can step back and accept that these words are a bit strange, nebulous, and inconsistent today, we have more freedom to treat these words as one tool in a bigger toolbox&mdash;we aren't locked forever into one way of how we think about ourselves
</p>

<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Slang.</b> The modern meaning of "humor" is kind of slangy. We can feel this slanginess by imagining that we're saying "juice” instead of humor:</p> 
     
     <ul class="close-list">
      <li>“he just has a great sense of juice about him”</li>
      <li>“that movie has great juice”</li> 
      <li>"it's juice that makes life worth living!"</li>
     <li>“just juice him, it's not worth the conflict”</li> 
     </ul>
     
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
     
     
        <p>One way of thinking about what "slang" is is that slang is where the meaning doesn't match its etymology. This gives some context to a new word like humor <callback>("moistness")</callback>, which often feels categorically different to more durable emotional words, like anger, grief, love, and so on.</p>    
        
    <ul class="close-list">
     <li>
         <sem-weak>anger, anxiety, angina,</sem-weak> and so on come from the root for <sem-weak>"painful, painfully constricted"</sem-weak>
     </li>
         
        <li>    <sem-weak>grief, grave, aggravate,</sem-weak> and so on come from the root of <sem-weak>"heavy"</sem-weak>
            </li>         
     
     <li>
         <sem-weak>love</sem-weak> comes from the root for <sem-weak>"care, love" </sem-weak>
     </li>
        </ul>
      
      <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
      
      <p>These words have been stable for thousands of years! By comparison, "juice" is a newcomer, and it feels that way.</p>
      
              <p>That doesn't mean humor is less important or meaningful than those other words. It just means "humor" as a word has characteristics that we have to take into account when thinking about it.</p>

   <!--
    <p>Whenever we combine information together, we have a cognitive rush we call a feeling.


<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
      
      <p>At first we <term>can't</term> combine information to read sheet music, financial statements, scientific instruments, debugging reports, game user interface, forest health, and so on.</p> 
      
      <p>But once we <term2>can</term2> take everything in at a glance, the cognitive rush of quickly combining everything together makes up the “feeling” of that activity.</p> 
    </div>
    
<p>

We eventually have a “feeling” when looking over financial statements&mdash;but we don’t have this feeling when we start out. Instead, the “feeling” is the feeling of quickly synthesizing bits of information together into what's experienced as a single impression. This means the feeling won't come before we're able to actually do this synthesis!</p>

<p>The same thing happens with interpreting emotions. We’ll always be expressing various emotion tells, but that doesn’t mean we'll make sense of them in any particular way.</p>

<p>This is why our emotions aren’t always obvious, especially the first time we come across them. Our first experiences with <emotions>affection</emotions>, <emotions>arousal</emotions>, <emotions>grief</emotions>, <emotions>love</emotions>, <emotions>jealousy</emotions>, <emotions>shame</emotions>, and so on are often confusing to us&mdash;and we often don’t recognize what was going on until later. It takes awareness and practice for something like "jealousy" to cohere as a feeling.</p>

<p>That's because it's not until we interpret many emotion tells at a glance that we'll have the "feeling" of being jealous&mdash;since the feeling of <emotions>jealousy</emotions> is actually the feeling of quickly interpreting and synthesizing emotion tells together.</p> 

<p>We were still expressing emotion tells for our early experiences with our first experiences with <emotions>affection</emotions>, <emotions>arousal</emotions>, <emotions>grief</emotions>, <emotions>love</emotions>, <emotions>jealousy</emotions>, <emotions>shame</emotions>, and so on&mdash;we just didn’t put them together in a way that had an overarching feeling.</p> 

<p>This is often a new way of thinking about emotions. We often learn simplistic models of emotions early in life, and aren't presented with alternative models as we grow older to keep pace with our broadening understanding. But there are good reasons to have a variety of emotional models at our disposal.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p>In our model of emotions, we express more low-intensity humor tells than we're currently interpreting <callback>(“feeling”)</callback> as humor. That means there's low-hanging fruit to increasing the humor in our lives&mdash;which is simply to <term>notice</term> our low-intensity humor tells <term2>as</term2> humor! </p>
    
    <p>If we practice registering these low-intensity humor tells&mdash;blips of focus, twinges in our cheeks, exhales, and so on&mdash;and composite these humor tells together as humor, we’ll start “feeling humor” where we didn’t before. We do this by becoming aware of the humor we already experience.</p>
    
    <p>This is especially useful during times that don't otherwise feel that interesting or exciting&mdash;like when waiting around. As we'll talk about later, these moments of low-intensity humor can be sparks we can cultivate into more humor.</p>
</div>
    
<p>A variety of models of emotions doesn't just help us understand <term>ourselves</term> better&mdash;it also helps us understand <term2>others</term2> better. We can better track the evaluatory responses people have, and make more sense of how they describe their emotional experiences.</p>
