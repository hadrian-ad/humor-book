    Case studies on the duration of humor
</h3>


<p>
	Putting everything together, we can think about why a specific instance of humor was as short or long as it was:
</p>

<h4><outcome-contrast>Short</outcome-contrast> duration of humor</h4>
<div class="h3">
    <div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <narration>Trevor is talking the dog out at night. As General Zod squats to pee, Trevor looks into the nearby patch of dark trees, and a deep fear comes over him.</narration></p>
            
        <p><narration>He starts to jog back to the house with the dog until he feels possessed by terror and sprints the final way. He races inside and locks the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.</narration></p>
        
            <p><speech>“Phew. We made it, Zod. Safe!”</speech> <narration>He laughs as the dog wags its tail.</narration><notes> (&larr;two seconds of <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes> <narration>Trevor goes about his business.</narration></p>

    <p>Trevor's mistake became small fast, since nothing really went contrary to any of his integrated expectations.</p> 
    
    <p>His humor was a short duration, as there wasn't much time for his evaluations to balance.</p>
</div>

<h4><outcome-contrast>Medium</outcome-contrast> duration of humor</h4><div class="h3">
    
        <div class="vignette">
      <blockquote>
              <p><narration>Lina gets an email that her college decision notification is ready. Her blood freezes. Heart pounding, she logs on to her account and clicks the ‘view decision update letter.’ Her mouth is dry while it loads.</narration></p>
            
            <p><speech>“Congratulations!”</speech> <narration>the letter says. Lina leaps up and pumps her fist.</narration> </p>

        Lina's mistake took a while to shrink, since it went contrary to a year of thought and worry. This large mistake matched her large OK for a medium duration.</p>

	<h4><outcome-contrast>Long</outcome-contrast> duration of humor</h4>

	        <narration>Dr. Timothy Ailes participates in Doctors Without Borders, and spends six months assisting people displaced by violence. While he has comfortable lodging not far from the capital, seeing the degraded infrastructure, services, and environment continually shocks him.</narration>
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        <narration>When he returns home to Washington, he’s shocked in reverse. As he lands in Tacoma and takes the train into Seattle, he’s speechless at the orderly housing and surplus of urban trees and efficient infrastructure with clean boundaries.</narration>
	        </p>
	        <p>
	        <narration>For weeks, he finds himself laughing almost at random. It’s complex humor, giving a strange sense of unreality as he goes about his old routines in Seattle.</narration> <notes>(&larr;two weeks of <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>

	    <p>
	    Since Timothy had habituated to living in Seattle, he had developed integrated expectations to those urban conditions. When he moved somewhere else, the different conditions went against his integrated expectations. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    This created a long <term>mistake</term>, since it took him a long time to acclimate. But this long mistake <outcome-contrast>didn’t</outcome-contrast> generate long <term2>humor</term2>, since this mistake didn't constantly match with an OK. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    The same process happens in reverse when Timothy moves back to Seattle. He had by then developed new expectations around <term>Bangui</term>, which meant that it was now <term2>Seattle</term2> that deviates from those expectations.</p> 
	    
	    <p>This long mistake <sem-weak>does</sem-weak> generate long duration of humor, since the long mistake is seen as mostly OK.

	        alt="There are two evaluation graphs, one showing mistake and OK, the other showing the intensity of humor. It shows how Timothy only feels a small bump of humor when going to Bangui, because the mistake overshoots the OK. But Timothy feels a lot of humor for a long time when he returns to Seattle, because the mistake and OK balance"

    <p>
     <b>Awareness.</b> It's usually second nature to note the <term>intensity</term> of humor. <callback>("How much humor are they feeling?")</callback> But once it's pointed out, it quickly becomes second nature to note the <term2>duration</term2> of humor too. <callback>("How long are they feeling humor for?")</callback>
        </p>
        <p>
     Both dimensions of humor are important to notice&mdash;intensity and duration&mdash;since both give us important information about their evaluations.
