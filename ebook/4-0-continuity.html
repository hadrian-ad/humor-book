<p>
	Last chapter, we saw that we evaluate mistakes and OKs as having a <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-1-mistakes-have-a-size.html">size</a>. In this chapter, we’ll look more at how these sizes <vocab>change over time</vocab>. 
</p>
<p>
	As our evaluations change, the intensity of humor changes:
</p>
    <div class="vignette">
     <blockquote>
               <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin are playing a board game. Yasmin is about to win until she has a catastrophically bad turn.</narration></p>
            <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*shouting*</action> <speech>“My halfling runs you down. I win!”</speech></p> 
            <p><narration>Tears run down their face as they howl with laughter.</narration> <notes>(&larr;high-intensity <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
            <p><narration>Then they settle into giggles. </narration><notes>(&larr;medium-intensity <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
            <p><narration>Finally, they just feel tired.</narration> <notes>(&larr;low-intensity <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
        </blockquote>
        </div>	 
<p>
	The intensity of Trevor and Yasmin’s humor changes because their evaluations change. 
</p>
	
	<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
         <consider>Consider:</consider>
                <p>If our evaluations stayed the same, we would start laughing and then never stop!</p>
    </aside>
	    </div>
	    
	    <p>
	We can look at more examples of evaluations changing over time:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>
          <p>
            <strong>A.</strong>	<narration>Hana and Alina stare at the broken instrument.</narration> <notes>(&larr;medium mistake)</notes>
        </p>
            <p><strong>B.</strong>	<narration>Hana asks how much it costs. She hopes it was under $1,000.</narration>
            <speech>“About $12,000,”</speech> <narration>Alina says. Hana is shocked.</narration><notes>(&larr;large mistake)</notes>
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>C.</strong> <narration>After giving it some thought, Hana is no longer shocked by the price. Still&mdash;she can’t believe it just… cracked like that!</narration> <notes>(&larr;medium mistake)</notes>
        </p>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
<img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-0-continuity/4-0-0-mistake-over-time.png"
    title="Tracking the size of mistake over time"
    alt="This timeline shows mistakes (represented as squares) changing size over time. When the instrument breaks, there's a mistake. When Hana hears how expensive the instrument was, the mistake gets even larger. After thinking about it, the mistake gets smaller."
    style="max-width: 23rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
	
   <div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> <narration>Damien loses track of his wallet, which is annoying.</narration> <notes>(&larr;medium OK)</notes></p>
        <p><strong>B.</strong> <narration>He thinks about all the stuff he keeps in it&mdash;including his debit card!</narration> <notes>(&larr;small OK)</notes></p>
        <p><strong>C.</strong> <narration>Worst of all, he keeps his pin written on a piece of paper in his wallet. Shit.</narration> <notes>(&larr;even smaller OK)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
    </div>
<img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-0-continuity/4-0-1-ok-over-time.png"
    title="Tracking the size of OK over time"
    alt="This timeline shows OKs (represented by squares) getting smaller and smaller as Damien thinks about how consequential it could be that he lost his wallet."
    style="max-width: 18rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
<p>
	Since we evaluate mistakes and OKs <vocab>continuously</vocab>, we can graph their change over time: 
</p>
<img
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-0-continuity/4-0-2-mistake-and-ok-over-time.png"
    title="Representing the change in the magnitude of mistake and OK as a line"
    alt="This image shows the previous two timelines of mistake and OK, but converts the changing size of squares into a graphs. On these graphs, the size of mistake and OK is the y axis, and the time is the x axis. One graph shows the size of mistake rise and fall as a dotted line, and another shows the size of OK continuously shrink as a solid line."
    style="max-width: 38rem;">

<p>
	We can put mistakes and OKs on the same graph:
</p>
   <div class="vignette">
    
   <blockquote>
         <p><narration>Then Owen leans over and tells Emma a joke.</narration></p> 
            <p><narration>She laughs.</narration></p> 
            <p><narration>Then she doesn't.</narration></p>
    </blockquote> 
   
    </div>
<img 
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-0-continuity/4-0-3-mistake-and-ok-over-time-together.png"
    title="Graphing mistakes and OKs together."
    alt="This image has our timelines for mistake and OK squares stacked on top of each other, with an arrow showing time. Below, this is re-represented as a graph. There's a straight solid line for the OK, with a dotted line for mistake rising from 0 up to touch the OK line before decreasing again. An arrow points out where the two lines meet, and says 'humor occurs when the lines for mistaken and OK meet'"
    style="max-width: 30rem;">
<p>
	This lets us graph the intensity of humor too. The intensity of humor <term>increases</term> the <term>closer</term> the mistake and OK are to touching <callback>(balancing)</callback>&mdash;and <term2>decreases</term2> the <term2>further away</term2> they get. This is why the intensity of humor tends to increase, peak, and then decrease:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Owen leans over and tells Emma a joke.</narration></p> 
        <p><narration>She laughs.</narration></p> 
        <p><narration>Then she doesn't.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor increases and then decreases in intensity)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>
    </div>
    
<img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-0-continuity/4-0-4-putting-it-all-together.png"
    title="The intensity of humor is greatest when the mistake and OK are closest"
    alt="This graph again has size of evaluations as the y axis, and time as the x axis. There are again two lines for mistake and OK. This graph adds a third line: a dotted line representing the intensity of humor. This line grows or shrinks based on how close the lines for mistake and OK are."
    style="max-width: 30rem;">
<p>
	We’ll talk about this throughout this chapter.
