    <h3 id="25-05">Humor bushes have a dress code</h3>


<p>The size of a humor bushes can be fitted or unfitted.</p> 

<p>In the same way a <term>single</term> instance of humor can be fitted or unfitted, <term2>many</term2> instances of humor together can also be seen as fitted or unfitted.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>For instance:</consider>
        
        <p>A large humor bush between Jennifer and Sam is more fitted than a small one&mdash;since Jennifer and Sam would prefer they have a relationship where <humor-outcome>new topics are <outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> opened</humor-outcome> than a relationship where <humor-outcome>new topics are <outcome-contrast>difficult</outcome-contrast> to open</humor-outcome>.</p>
    </aside>
    
    </div>

<p>To find the dress code for humor bushes, we can think about what we want to be able to do with someone. For instance, as Heather and Justin continue to date, they’ll want to increasingly be able to:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>share secrets</li>
    <li>give each other honest feedback</li>
    <li>ask each other for help</li>
    <li>do what we ask each other to do</li>
    <li>share personal details</li>
    <li>discuss personal problems</li>
    <li>share recreational time</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To be able to do these things, Heather and Justin will have to be able to mutually characterize their relationship as:

<ul class="close-list">
     <li>
         <humor-outcome>able to reveal <outcome-contrast>any</outcome-contrast> personal views</humor-outcome>
     </li> 
      <li>
          <humor-outcome>having <outcome-contrast>complete</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>
      </li>
      <li>
          <humor-outcome>having <outcome-contrast>exceptionally</outcome-contrast> close ties</humor-outcome>
      </li> 
      <li>
          <humor-outcome>having <outcome-contrast>unlimited</outcome-contrast> ability to open new topics of conversation</humor-outcome>
      </li>
      </ul>  
  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
  
  <p>That means a large humor bush between partners would be fitted.</p>

<p>But a larger humor bush isn’t <sem-weak>always</sem-weak> more fitted. Heather is a high school math teacher, and Lina is her student&mdash;and it would be unfitted for Heather and Lina to: 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>
       <humor-outcome>have <outcome-contrast>unlimited</outcome-contrast> ability to deal with taboo topics (with each other)</humor-outcome>
   </li>
    <li><humor-outcome>have <outcome-contrast>unlimited</outcome-contrast> ability to open new topics of conversation (with each other)</humor-outcome> </li></ul>

  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

  <p>In that case, the humor bush between a teacher and student would be too big.</p>

<p>But while a humor bush can be too <term>large</term>, it can also be too <term2>small</term2>&mdash;it would be unfitted for Heather and Lina to:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>
        have <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> ability to deal with any taboo topics</humor-outcome>
    </li> 
     <li>have <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> ability to open any new topics of conversation</humor-outcome>.</li></ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>This means the dress code for a humor bush falls within a range:</p>
