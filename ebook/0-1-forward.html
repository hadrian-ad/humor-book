    <blockquote class="testimonial"><p>"The beautiful thing about this book is that it causes you to notice and appreciate an area of life that everyone agrees is important but receives very little formal investigation. I will be in the middle of a laugh with someone and cannot help but mentally dissect the situation with my new humor tools- which in turn makes me smile more."</p></blockquote>

    <p>It is more tiring to stand and watch a procession than to be part of it.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite books, <book-title>Rethinking Sitting</book-title>, takes something ostensibly obvious and settled <callback>(chairs, sitting)</callback>&mdash;and then hits it with a lightning bolt. A touch of catalytic insight and <sem-weak>snap!</sem-weak> the picture goes into focus, and at that point we realized it had been blurry all along.</p>
    
    <p>Many of our observations are waiting to come alive like this&mdash;and, when they do, how we look at the world is permanently changed.</p> 
    
    <p>I'm sure you can see where I'm going with this: we'll be doing something similar to humor in this book. My goal is for you to notice things that, once pointed out, can't ever be unseen&mdash;and for you to smile as this happens. It'll be fun!</p>     
    
    <p>I am a teacher of humor. My goal is to guide people through their own observations of smiling and laughing to help them see things that have been right in front of their eyes. This isn't exactly like learning to be funny&mdash;it's something broader and much more inclusive.</p> 
    
    <p>Most of us grew up with little to no exposure humor education&mdash;and if we were, it was probably only to unsophisticated and rudimentary ideas on it. For instance, you've probably taken a geometry class&mdash;but probably never a humor class. The consequences of this kind of illiteracy are too long to list. </p>
    
     <p>I think it's part of why serious instruction on humor resonates with so many people. People are ready for the power and strength of orientation that comes from studying smiling and laughing&mdash;I wager you're ready too.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I am a humor theorist and teacher&mdash;my day work is in community-building and placemaking. This underlies my perspectives on humor, which tend to focus first on interpersonal and environmental elements.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as a professional writer and environmental historian at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping STEM graduate students or postdocs write dissertations and research articles. These experiences influenced the style and emphases I chose for this book.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught&mdash;I read full-time for several years while learning to partner dance and host gatherings. This period of exploration gave me some independence of thought, giving me some detachment from received ideas about humor.</p>
        
        <p>I am indebted to Warren Shibles, a forgetten academic I never met. In high school, I came across his self-published and monumentally weird <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;a  work of tilted clarity that set me down this path years ago.</p>

     <p>I'd like to thank the philosopher Warren Shibles, whose free and bizarre materials on humor set me on the path of humor observation at a young age. His monumental (and monumentally strange) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> exists only on the Internet archives, but had a lucid kind of beauty that impressed significantly.</p>
