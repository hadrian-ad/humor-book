    <p>Welcome to this classic manual to humor! Time and time again, readers have been left with the sticky sense that the world is more beautiful and elegant than they had supposed.</p>
           
    <p>Readers of this book often attest to the same pleasing quality of "surprising obviousness" that is present throughout. By re-viewing familiar experiences, and teasing out some shared structure between them, readers are initiated into a useful and profound way of seeing the world.</p> 
       
    <p>Both analytical and narrative, this textbook will help you find this abiding sense of practical beauty and usable elegance too.</p>
