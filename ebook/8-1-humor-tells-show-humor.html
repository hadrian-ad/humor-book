Humor means humor tells 
</h2>


<p>We can annotate more pictures to get a better sense of <vocab>humor tells</vocab>:</p>

 <img class="photo" src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-1-images/8-1-0-beaming-stephanie.jpg"

title="Woman smiling"
alt="This photo shows a young woman in a pedestrian market, who is turning to look at something, smiling happily with bright eyes."
style="max-width: 25rem;"
>

<p>Above, the woman <humor-tell>brightens</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>flushes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>activates eyes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>thinks fast</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focuses on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>has energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seeks</humor-tell> <callback>(turns to comment to someone)</callback>, <humor-tell>social tightens</humor-tell> <callback>(slows pace to let others get closer)</callback>, and so on.</p> 

<p>Since there are many humor tells that are clearly expressed, humor is the majority of her emotional state:</p>

title="Man with chicken plushie on head"
alt="This photo shows a man sitting with a hand on his mouth, looking thoughtful, with a fake chicken balanced on his head."
style="max-width: 14rem; "
>
 

<p>Even though we often think of humor as something expressed with laughter and smiles, this isn’t always the case&mdash;like in the picture below, where the man is feeling humor <outcome-contrast>without</outcome-contrast> <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>:</p>

<img class="photo" src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-1-images/8-1-2-no-smile-hadrian-chicken.jpg"

title="Humor is part of a mixed emotional state"
alt="This emotion box has several emotional zones, with a label for a section of humor. An annotation says the emotional state is mixed."
style="max-width: 20rem;"
>

<p>The man above is <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>making efforts to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>showing non-normative behavior</humor-tell>. So even though <term>some</term> common humor tells are <term>absent</term> <callback>(smiling)</callback>, there's enough <term2>other</term2> humor tells <term2>present</term2> for us to say there's humor in his emotional state.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>
        In the picture above we're partly using <em>decisions</em> to identify humor. By keeping the chicken on his head, the man is making a choice to <humor-tell>spread humor</humor-tell> and have <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>. If he <term>wasn’t</term> feeling humor, he <term2>wouldn’t</term2> be making these choices&mdash;he’d instead take the chicken off his head.</p>
   </aside> </div>

<p>Even though we can identity humor in the man above, there aren’t enough humor tells for us to think his humor is particularly intense or prominent. In this case, we’d see his humor as  part of a mixed emotional state:</p>

title="Man losing chess"
alt="This photograph shows a man with a hand on his head, looking wistfully at the camera, a chess board below him. He has a vague discomfited smile."
style="max-width: 14rem; "
>

<p>We can look at another picture where humor is a minor part of a mixed emotional state:</p>

<img class="photo" src="../images/8c-images-humor-tells/8-1-images/8-1-4-complicated-smile.jpg"

title="Humor can be a small part of an emotional state"
alt="This emotion box has sevaral sections, with a very small section for humor. An annotation says 'humor is a minority of an emotional state.'"
style="max-width: 20rem;"
>

<p>Above, the man has <callback>(partially)</callback> <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell>, a <callback>(light)</callback> <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <callback>(unenthusiastic)</callback> <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> <callback>(by glancing at the picture taker)</callback>. These humor tells help us see there’s at least some humor in his emotional state.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>If the man had <outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor, he would have more inverse humor tells: instead of <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, he would be <outcome-contrast>frowning</outcome-contrast>; instead of <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell>, he would have <outcome-contrast>contracting posture</outcome-contrast>; and so on. Since this isn’t the case, we can say that there’s at least some humor in his emotional state.</p>
   </aside></div> 

<p>The man isn’t just expressing humor tells, but other emotion tells at the same time&mdash;these other emotion tells show <emotions>exasperation</emotions>, <emotions>frustration</emotions>, <emotions>tiredness</emotions>, and so on. Because of this, we'd say the man has a mixed emotional state that includes <term>some</term> humor, but not <term2>much</term2>.</p>

    <p><headline>Inference.</headline> Sometimes <vocab>emotion tells</vocab> are things we observe <term>directly</term>, like <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> or <emotion-tell>frowns</emotion-tell>. But other times emotion tells can be inferred <term2>indirectly</term2>&mdash;like how we can sometimes gauge our partner’s emotional state by:</p>
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>what's on their grocery receipt</li>
        <li>what they’ve been watching recently</li>
        <li>whether they leave early or late</li>
        <li>how many hours they’ve spent playing which game</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
     
    <p>That's because emotion tells are actions and decisions as well as facial cues. This is obvious with cats. Since cats have a very limited range of facial expressions, we understand their emotional states by paying attention to their actions.</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>if a cat is afraid, it hides</li>
        <li>if it’s in a good mood, it looks for people</li>
        <li>if it’s stressed, it pees everywhere</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>What expresses the cat's emotional state isn't so much in their <term>face</term>, which expresses little&mdash;but their <term2>actions</term2> and <term2>decisions</term2>. The cat's absence or the cat’s pee are <em>themselves</em> emotion tells. 
        
    <p>It's the same for humans. While we also express emotion tells through our face, we also express emotion tells through actions and decisions&mdash;which is as true for <emotions>humor</emotions> as it is for <emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>sadness</emotions>, and so on.</p>
