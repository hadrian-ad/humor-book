Topics help us be precise when generating humor</h2>
 
<p>
	We don't need to hear a joke to laugh. Sam laughs below, even though Jennifer doesn't do anything "funny:"
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Sam is examining his balding head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</narration>
        <speech>“You look so <em>handsome</em>,”</speech> <narration>she says, squeezing him.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer identifies that Sam has a medium mistake on a topic related to physical self-esteem)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer shifts Sam’s OK to match the medium mistake on this topic)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>
    </div>
<p>
	Jennifer wants Sam to feel humor. But more specifically, she wanted him to feel humor
	on a <em>specific topic</em>&mdash;she wants the topic 'Sam's physical self-esteem' to generate humor.
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>It matters which topic generates humor. Jennifer could make Sam laugh by giving him an affirmation <callback>(of her good opinion of him)</callback> or telling him a joke <callback>(about a burrito)</callback>&mdash;but even though Sam would laugh at both, the emotional results from each would be different.</p>
        
        <p>That's because it matters which topic generates humor&mdash;the outcome is different whether the topic 'burrito' or the topic 'physical self-esteem' generates Sam's humor.
        </p>
    </aside>
    </div>
    
<p>
	To shift Sam's evaluations into balance, Jennifer didn't try to do anything conventionally funny at all. That's because her goal isn't actually to be "funny", but to balance mistakes and OKs&mdash;and there are many ways to do that.
</p>
<p>
	In this case, Jennifer used an <term>affirmation</term> to raise Sam's OK&mdash;since an affirmation helped  him feel more secure from negative personal consequences. A <term2>joke</term2> would have had a narrow path on this particular topic at balancing mistakes and OKs.

        <p>
            When we have situational goals, we have to be precise about which topics we activate and focus on.</p> 
            
            <p>Like Jennifer, we can generate humor in a way that's both connected to and emerging out of someone’s life&mdash;which can influence people in positive ways.
