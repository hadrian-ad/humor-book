    <h3 id="21-01">Dress codes are constantly changing</h3>
    
   
<p>The humor dress code changes situation by situation&mdash;like how the humor dress code is higher at the office and lower when we’re at home:</p>

    alt="This image shows two bar graphs side by side. The first is labeled 'at home' and has a low dress code, represented as a dotted line low across the graph. The second is labeled 'at office' and has a high dress code. The dotted line has arrows pointing above and below, where above is increasingly more fitted and belowe increasingly unfitted."

<p>The dress code is constantly adjusting. Not just hour by hour, but minute by minute&mdash;and even second by second.</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>The dress code goes <term>up</term> when an all-staff meeting starts, and goes <term2>down</term2> when the meeting finishes</li>
    
    <li>The dress code goes <term>up</term> when the fire alarm goes off, and <term2>down</term2> when we get outside and are just waiting for the fire department to arrive</li>
    
    <li>The dress code goes <term>up</term> when we start discussing a big financial decision with our partner, and <term2>down</term2> when we switch to watching a movie</li>
    </ul>

    alt="This image expands on the previous graph by added an arrow between the two graphs, which is labeled 'five seconds later.' The first graph says 'at home (hanging out)' and the second says 'at home (discussing financial decisions),' with a much higher dress code. An annotation notes that the dress code can change second-by-second."

<p>Each moment, what's considered fitted shifts relative to humor dress code. </p>
