Each humor tell is expressed many ways
</h3>



<p>Each humor tell has an endless variation in how it can be expressed&mdash;like <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>:</p>

<p>In this book, we’ll referring to all of these exhales and inhales generically as <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>.</p> 

<p>So in our examples, we'll say that  people <action>*laugh*</action>&mdash;but that doesn't usually mean they had some kind of cliche, high-intensity laughter. (<humor-tell>“Hahahahahahah!”</humor-tell>) Instead, it usually refers to a laugh that’s less intense and in endless variety&mdash;like <humor-tell>“pff!”</humor-tell> <humor-tell>“ah!”</humor-tell> <humor-tell>“heh!”</humor-tell>, and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>We can see this in some examples:</p>

    <p>In our day-to-day conversations, we don’t always have an overall word for sounds like <callback>“hm!”</callback> or <callback>“huh!”</callback> or <callback>“fff!!”</callback> But in this book, we’ll just call them <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>.</p> 

<p>In the same way a <term>half-smile</term> and a <term>full smile</term> are different intensities of the same overall thing <callback>(a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>)</callback>&mdash;<term2>hm!</term2> and <term2>hahahahah!</term2> are different intensities of the same overall thing <callback>(a <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>)</callback>.</p>

        <p>We’ll mostly use the generic <action>*laughs*</action> throughout this book to indicate all kinds of <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>. This keeps our examples easy to read, even though it does cut out specific information about that humor's duration, intensity, and so on.</p>
        
     <p>It's the same for many humor tells too&mdash;characters in this book will generically <action>*smile*</action> to indicate all kinds of situationally specific and nuanced <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>.</p> </aside>

   <aside class="box">
         <p><b>Inflection.</b> Like any humor tell, how we laugh conveys a lot of nuance about the intensity and duration of our humor. <callback>("Heh" versus "HAH!" and "hahahahaha" versus "HAHAHAHAHA!")</callback> But how we laugh <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> conveys  whether our evaluations are tilted toward mistake- or OK-predominance.</p> 
         
        <p>If our evaluations aren't perfectly balanced, our laugh can show that we're leaning toward the <term>OK-predominant</term> zone <callback>(like Jessica's "hm!")</callback>, or whether we're leaning toward the <term2>mistake-predominant</term2> zone <callback>(like Trevor's "uuahh!")</callback>:</p>

        <p>Jessica's and Trevor's evaluations fell on different sides of the watershed line of highest-intensity humor&mdash;which was conveyed by how they laughed.</p> 
        
        <p>This isn't just true for <term>laughs</term>, but for <term2>all</term2> humor tells&mdash;smiles can be angry or sad <callback>(humor mingled with mistake-predominant emotions)</callback>, or smiles can be bored or social <callback>(humor mingled with OK-predominant emotions)</callback>.</p>
