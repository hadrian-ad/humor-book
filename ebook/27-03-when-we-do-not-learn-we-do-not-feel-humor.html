<h3 id="27-03">The absence of humor shows the absence of learning</h3>



<p>We can look at examples where the presence of humor shows the <term>presence</term> of learning, and the <outcome-contrast>absence</outcome-contrast> of humor shows an <term2>absence</term2> of learning:</p>

<p>There was fitted, low-intensity humor throughout the example, with an instance of more intense, less-fitted humor at the end. <callback>(“Blurgh!”)</callback></p>

<p>To see how the humor and the interpretation of the manuscript went hand-in-hand, we can use contrasting examples of them <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feeling humor:</p>

        <p>We have words like insight, learning, perspective-incorporation, teaching, understanding, and so on&mdash;and the connection between them all is fitted <em>humor</em>.</p>
