All intensities of humor matter
</h3>


<p>Humor tells convey intensity&mdash;like how a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> can be <term>low-intensity</term> <callback>(light smile)</callback> or <term2>high-intensity</term2> <callback>(beaming)</callback>:</p>

title="Spectrums of smile"
alt="This spectrum has 'less intense smile' on the left, and 'more intense smile' on the right. Arrows at various marks along this spectrum correspond to images of a man in different contexts with different intensities of smiles."
style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left:"
>

<p>Sometimes we only focus on the more-intense half of the spectrum&mdash;like broad <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> that crest into <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>. But we should <em>also</em> be able to see the less-intense half of the spectrum too:</p>

title="We should focus on all intensities of humor tells"
alt="This image has two spectrums, both with 'less intense humor' on one end and 'more intense humor' on the other. The top spectrum has just the 'more intense' half circled, and an annotation says that 'we often focus on high-intensity variations of humor, and ignore low-intensity variations.' The second spectrum has the entire thing circled, and an annotation says 'we should instead treate the whole range of a humor tell as important."

<!--
<p>The importance of low-intensity humor is obvious in our day-to-day life, even if low-intensity humor isn't what we always first think of when asked to think abstractly about "humor:"</p>

alt="This image has two stills from the show, one where the therapist is completely serious and one a moment later where her face breaks into humor. An arrow shows this on an evaluation graph, where the intensity of humor has a small bump."

<p>In this book, we'll want to understand this low-intensity humor <em>as well</em> as we understand high-intensity humor.</p>

<!--

<p>
 
 When we see humor everywhere it occurs, we can better understand how people relate to what's happening around them&mdash;as well better acclimate to all the various humor profiles around us.</p>

        <p><headline>Accounting.</headline> We wouldn't be very good accountants if we didn't realize that cents were money&mdash;or if we thought we never had to account for them in any situation. Something similar happens with humor.</p> 
        
        <p>If we didn't realize that a twinge in our cheeks was a <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>&mdash;or thought we never had to bother paying attention to these <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>&mdash;we would have some blind spots in our accounting.</p>
