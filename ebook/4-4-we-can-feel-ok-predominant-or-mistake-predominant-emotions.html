Emotions are either OK-predominant or mistake-predominant</h2>

<!-- 04.40 -->

<p>Our evaluations have three emotional configurations&mdash;three <vocab>emotional zones</vocab></p>

<p>There is a <em>mistake-predominant zone</em>, where the <term>mistake</term> is larger than the <term>OK</term>. There's also the <em>OK-predominant zone</em>, where the <term2>OK</term2> is larger than the <term2>mistake</term2>.</p>
<p>
	These zones are separated by when these two evaluations are balanced: the <em>balanced zone</em>&mdash;humor:

    alt="This figure shows our table, and then an arrow shows the abstraction of the table we'll use in this book. It's an emotion quilt graph, with three quadrants: mistake-predominant, OK-predominant, and sandwhiched between is humor. The mistake-predominant and OK-predominant increase the further one goes into them, while the humor fades into the other two."

<p>
	The line of highest-intensity humor is like a watershed line: on either side of it, the humor starts to change one of two ways&mdash;into either OK-predominant emotions or mistake-predominant emotions.
</p>
    
	<h3>Humor into mistake-predominance</h3>
	
	<div class="h3"><p>
	    While the mistake and OK balance, we feel intense humor. But if the mistake grows or the OK shrinks, we head toward the <em>mistake-predominant zone</em>:

	        alt="This evaluation graph has size as the y axis and time as the x axis, and plots mistake and OK. It shows the mistake outsizing the OK more and more over time, and lables it as increasing mistake-predominance."
	        style="max-width: 34rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
	    
	    <p>
	    As we head into the mistake-predominant zone, our emotional state contains less humor and more and more  mistake-predominant emotions, like <emotions>afraid</emotions>, <emotions>ashamed</emotions>, <emotions>bummed</emotions>, <emotions>confused</emotions>, <emotions>excited</emotions>, <emotions>irritated</emotions>, <emotions>focused</emotions>, <emotions>grieving</emotions>, <emotions>perplexed</emotions>, <emotions>jealous</emotions>, <emotions>sad</emotions>, <emotions>stressed</emotions>, <emotions>terrified</emotions>, <emotions>worried</emotions>, <i>and so on</i>.</p> 
	    
	    <p>
	    Eventually, there’s no humor, and we’re left with <em>only</em> mistake-predominant emotions.

    <h3>Humor into OK-predominance</h3>
<div class="h3">
    <p>	
        The opposite happens if we tilt toward the OK-predominant zone. At first, we feel intense humor. But if the mistake shrinks or the OK grows, we move further into the OK-predominant zone.

        style="max-width: 30rem; margin-top: 1.5rem;">
    
    <p>
        As we head into the OK-predominant zone, our emotional state contains less humor and more and more  OK-predominant emotions like <emotions>apathetic</emotions>, <emotions>bored</emotions>, <emotions>calm</emotions>, <emotions>certain</emotions>, <emotions>content</emotions>, <emotions>convinced</emotions>, <emotions>detached</emotions>, <emotions>leisurely</emotions>, <emotions>listless</emotions>, <emotions>neutral</emotions>, <emotions>relaxed</emotions>, <emotions>stagnant</emotions>, <emotions>satisfied</emotions>, <emotions>tranquil</emotions>, <emotions>unexcited</emotions>, <i>and so on</i>. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Eventually, the mistakes and OK are so far apart that our humor is gone, and we’re left with <em>only</em> an OK-predominant emotion:
