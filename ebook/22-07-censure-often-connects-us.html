    <h3 id="22-07">Censure connects us more often than divides us</h3>
    
<p>We often think of censure as something that <term>divides</term> people. But censure usually <term2>connects</term2> us instead:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Jasper makes a joke with a tasteless fake accent, and it’s cringey. Sam meets a stranger’s eye.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam and a stranger connect with each other by censuring Jasper)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Justin and Heather are cleaning up after a dinner party.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*amused*</action> <speech>“How about Travis just barging into every conversation?!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“I couldn’t believe it!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin and Heather connect with each other by censuring Travis)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(mimicking)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh you went to Philly? That reminds of the time I went to Seoul!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(mimicking)</internalaction> <speech>“Fantastic. Fantastic!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><narration>They continue bonding as they clean.</narration></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

 

<div class="vignette">
 <blockquote>
           <p><narration>Sam and the rest of the administrators have to watch a new training video. It’s full of tedious puns. It’s both infantilizing and a waste of time.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>People adjust themselves in their seats, check their phones, and sigh. Everyone is aware of how much they are all hating this.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam and the rest of staff connect with each other by censuring video)</notes></p>

<p>In the examples above, the censure is something people are doing <term>with</term> each other, not <term2>against</term2> each other:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>
        When Sam and a stranger exchange looks at Jasper’s fake accent, they’re checking to confirm that they have synchronized evaluations&mdash;which tightens them as a subnetwork. Whether Jasper notices this censure is neither here nor there.
    </li>
    
             <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-11-censure-often-connects-us/17-11-0-censure-as-connection.png
    
        alt="This surface tension figure shows Jasper and two audience members sharing equal surface tension. An arrow shows a later moment, where Sam and a stranger connect with each other in censure of Jasper. This tightens their surface tension, tightening their group relative to their group with Jasper."
        title="Surface tension figure I"
        style="max-width: 30rem; margin-left: ">
    
    <li>
        <listblock>Justin and Heather are synchronizing in a way tightens their emotion network&mdash;but they intentionally waited until Travis is gone to do this. Their censure is something they do with each other, not something they do against someone.</listblock>
        
                 <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-11-censure-often-connects-us/17-11-1-justin-heather-bring-closer.png
        
            alt="This surface tension figure shows two people with low surface tension, and an arrow showing a later moment where they have high surface tension. An annotation says 'Justin and Heather use censure as a humor attempt to bring them closer.'"
            title="Surface tension figure II"
            style="max-width:22rem ; margin-left: ">
        
        <listblock>Heather and Justin are processing mistakes together. They’re shifting mistakes and OKs into balance and <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>sharing personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizing</humor-outcome>, and so on.</listblock>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        The school administrators are watching a video, which means they <em>can’t</em> censure the people who made the training video&mdash;there’s no one there to censure! Their censure is something they do together. They want to make sure everyone shares their grievances about the video.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Most censure is connective like this&mdash;it synchronizes groups more tightly. Censure is <term>usually</term> used to calibrate groups or connect people <term>together</term>&mdash;and is only <term2>rarely</term2> used confrontationally to <term2>divide</term2> or fragment groups.</p>


<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>Censure redefines groups, often subtly, like over the course of a dinner. Nothing really happens, other than a shift in some of the group dynamics.</p> 
       
       <p>Sometimes this happens more aggressively, where enough connective censure builds up that we’re able to exclude or expel the target or source of our censure.</p>
        
       <p>But even though this expulsion is <sem-weak>sometimes</sem-weak> an outcome of this process, it’s not the most common outcome or even the main general goal of this process.</p>
   </aside>

<p>Humor dress codes and censure are how we communicate, group, and organize. In our day-to-day lives, humor dress codes allow feedback in ways that allows social groups to function well together.</p>
