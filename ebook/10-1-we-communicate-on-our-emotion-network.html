    <h3 id="10-01">We use emotion networks to communicate</h3>
    
   
<p>Once our emotion network is pointed out, we notice it everywhere:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
          
          <p><narration>Zoe is backpacking in Brazil. The train she’s on gives a frightening bounce. Alarmed, she looks around.</narration></p> 
           
           <p class="vig-indent"><strong>A.</strong> <narration>The bounce made the commuters sit up and mutter darkly to each other. Zoe’s heart continues to pound.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe determines from others that the bounce was a mistake and <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> OK)</notes></p>
           
           <p class="or">- OR -</p>
           
           <p class="vig-indent"><strong>B.</strong> <narration>The bounce made the commuters sit up and laugh and chat with each other. Zoe relaxes a bit.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe determines from others that the bounce was a mistake but OK)</notes></p>
           
           <p class="or">- OR -</p>
           
           <p class="vig-indent"><strong>C.</strong> <narration>All the commuters seem bored and uninterested. She calms down.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe determines from others that the bounce was not a mistake and so was OK)</notes></p>
   </blockquote>
    
    </div>

   alt="This evaluation graph shows how Zoe's mistake is sized according to how others react. At A, the mistake far overshoots the OK. At B, the mistake balances. At C it undershoots."
    title="We cue evaluations off of others."

     >


<p>Everyone on the train was sharing their evaluations of mistakes and OKs. Zoe was able to synchronize her evaluations to theirs <callback>("they're not worried so I'm not worried")</callback>&mdash;even though she was around people she didn’t know and who spoke a different language than her.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>Everyone else on the train could also assess Zoe’s evaluations of mistakes and OKs, just like she could theirs.</p>
        
        <p>Unless there's a substantial emotional <a href="10-0-emotion-network.html">screen</a> <callback>(we’re watching people in a recording, looking at them from a window, or so on)</callback>&mdash;we can’t <term>receive</term> information from an emotion network without also <term2>putting in</term2> information.</p>
   </aside>
    </div>
    
<p>We do this whenever we’re around others, for every active topic&mdash;even when that topic seems inconsequential. Below, Owen gets feedback on his new hat through the emotion network:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    
  <blockquote>  <p><narration>Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table, and they look up at him.</narration></p>
        
        <p class="vig-indent"><strong>A.</strong> <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*stares blank faced*</action></p>
        
        <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(carefully)</internalaction> "Nice hat."</p>
        
        <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(uncomfortable)</internalaction> "Thanks." <notes>(&larr;Owen determines from Emma and Zoe that they see the hat as a mistake and that they are unsure if it’s OK)</notes></p>    
        
        <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
        
        <p class="vig-indent"><strong>B.</strong> <narration>Zoe and Emma laugh.</narration></p>
        
        <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(admiringly)</internalaction> "Nice hat, man!"</p>
        
        <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(pleased)</internalaction> <internalaction>(happily)</internalaction> "Thanks! <notes>(&larr;Owen determines that Zoe and Emma see the hat as a mistake but that they feel it’s OK)</notes></p>
        
        <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
        
        <p class="vig-indent"><strong>C.</strong> <narration>Zoe and Emma barely glance at Owen. He was hoping for a bit of a reaction&mdash;but at least it must look normal.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen determines that Zoe and Emma see the hat as not a mistake and so without negative consequences)</notes></p>
        </blockquote>
    
    </div>

<p>Owen isn't focused so much on literal statements made by Zoe and Emma. Instead, he pays attention to what he learns over their emotion network:

<img src=../images/10c-images-emotion-network/10-1-we-communicate-on-our-emotion-network/10-1-1-outcome-transformation-2.png

    alt="Like the previous image, this evaluation graph shows how the mistake is sized differently in moments A, B, and C."
    title="We cue our evaluations off of others II"

<p>This emotion network provides the evaluatory context that everything happens in.</p>


<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Communal sense.</headline> Our emotional state isn’t private&mdash;to varying degrees, our emotional state is common information to everyone around us, just like theirs are to us. Our ability to pick up on these collective evaluations is almost like a sense&mdash;a “communal” sense.</p>
     
     <p>For many of us, our communal sense is so obvious that we only notice it when we <sem-weak>don’t</sem-weak> have it. For instance, when we go up to give our big presentation, we can get so nervous that we lose our ability to interpret our audience's emotion tells as coherent information.</p>
     
     <p>We can still <sem-weak>see</sem-weak> the audience when this happens&mdash;we just lose ability to interpret their emotional state. This can be as disorienting as losing any other sense, and when it happens we can feel socially unmoored and vulnerable.</p>
