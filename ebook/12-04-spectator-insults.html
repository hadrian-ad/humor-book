Laughing at the pain of others

<p>Above, Owen, Zoe, and Emma laugh, even though they know the group members were devastated. They can do this in part because they know their reaction is only shared among themselves.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p>Since no evaluatory information can reach the described emotion network, Owen, Zoe, and Emma have a large OK.</p> 
    
    <p>Not only was the event in the past, but their security from negative personal consequences is mostly set by each other&mdash;not the people being talked about.</p>

<p>When we watch characters in a skit give each other insults, <term>we</term> laugh&mdash;but the <term2>characters</term2> are devastated:</p>

<p><term>Owen</term> feels humor watching the clip, but the <term2>characters</term2> in the show <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> feel nearly as much humor.</p>

title="Interaction template"
alt="This interaction template figure simplifies the figures we've seen before. At the top are two-way arrows between farmers and jocks, labeled as feeling pain. A one-way arrow goes to Owen, labeled as feeling humor. "
style="max-width: 18rem;"
>

<p>On a surface level, Owen feels humor because he finds large mistakes <callback>(creative insults)</callback> has a very large OK <callback>(he's just watching a recorded skit)</callback>.
    </p>
 <p>Looking a little deeper, Owen feels humor because the actors and their characters are <em>prioritizing</em> Owen's evaluations&mdash;it's the priority that shapes everything about the clip. The casting, costumes, blocking, scripting, and so on is done to raise Owen's mistake and OK to a place where they balance. </p>
 
  <p>This prioritization is something that makes the clip "surreal" and different from our more spontaneous, mutual interactions. </p>



<!--
<p>The impermeable evaluatory screen is part of what allows the spectator entertainment to have things both ways: the <term>characters</term> can feel <term>mistake-predominant</term> emotions from insults, while the <term2>spectators</term2> can feel <term2>humor</term2> from those insults.</p>

<p>Normally, an emotion network tries to synchronize evaluations. But if Owen is confident in the evaluatory screen, he'll be able to react without trying to reach evaluatory consensus&mdash;and so he can laugh, even when they feel pain.</p>

<div class="consider"><p 
   class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p>Note that this isn't just about <sem-weak>humor</sem-weak>&mdash;since we can watch clips of people laughing and feel sick to our stomach too. Instead, an evaluatory screen makes desynchronized evaluatory reactions possible.</p>

<div class="consider"><aside class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>Just because <term>we</term> laugh at insults in spectator entertainment doesn't mean we can make our <term2>friends</term2> laugh by insulting them.</p> 
            
        <p>It's not that insults don't ever make our friends laugh&mdash;since they do! Instead, it's that we can't transfer things wholesale between spectator entertainment and interpersonal interactions without modifications.</p>

         <p><b>Admiration without aspiration.</b> The clip of the farmers and hockey players was seen millions of times, with people admiring it for its caricature, delivery, pacing, scripting, and so on. One of the top comments saw the dialogue as loosely aspirational:</p>
        
        <div class="vignette">
           <blockquote>
                 <p><speaker>Commenter:</speaker> <speech>“How would a person get that good at comebacks and insults? I mean I know it’s all scripted but shit. That’s superhuman levels of wit.”</speech></p>
            </blockquote>
        </div> 
        
        <p>The commenter answered their own question! We <em>can’t</em> get that good at comebacks and insults. The <sem-weak>writers</sem-weak> of the show aren’t that good at spontaneous comebacks and insults. They had a long production cycle and lots of crew to create an illusion of superhuman spontaneity.</p>
        
        <p>Sometimes we think we’re supposed to be able to be like people in comedies because we like comedies. But we’re <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> supposed to be&mdash;for the same reason we don’t think we’re <sem-weak>supposed</sem-weak> to be like action heroes just because we like action movies.</p>
