<h3 id="26-02">Our opinion is based on fitted humor</h3>



<p>If there are two math teachers at a high school, students won't have the same opinion of their classes&mdash;even if those math teachers have identical lesson plans.</p>

<p>Instead, the students will have a <term>higher</term> opinion of whichever class better generates more <term2>fitted</term2> humor. This will be the teacher that:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>presents the content in a way that creates <emotions>insight</emotions></li>
    <li>pushes students the right amount so that they feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions></li>
    <li>validates honest efforts, and helps students feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions></li>
    <li>structures tests well, and allows for feelings of <emotions>success</emotions></li>
    <li>decorates a room well, and allows students to feel <emotions>belonging</emotions></li>
    <li>acknowledges students, and can help them feel <emotions>welcome</emotions></li>
    <li>allows group bonding, and lets students feel <emotions>connection</emotions></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>When students think back to how good or bad the class was, they'll think about their humor bush. If they how <term>frequently</term> felt <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on, they'll have a <term>good</term> opinion of the class.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider"> <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>
        Sometimes it doesn’t seem accurate to say that humor makes up our opinion of teachers&mdash;in part because we're so used to thinking of <term>comedy</term>. <callback>(Prioritizing <outcome-contrast>intensity</outcome-contrast>.)</callback> But it makes more sense when we're able to think about <term>charm</term>. <callback>(Prioritizing <outcome-contrast>fittedness</outcome-contrast>.)</callback> </p>
        
        
        <p>
        <term2>Sometimes</term2> our favorite teachers were the cool, funny, or outrageous ones&mdash;but more <term2>specifically</term2>, we liked best the teachers who best helped us experience humor family words, like <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. Their ability to do this may or may not have overlapped with our stereotypical ideas of coolness or funniness.</p> 
         </aside>
</div>


<p>If a class <outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> feels fitted humor, they’ll <outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> feel <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, and so on&mdash;and the <term2>lack</term2> of humor family words gives students a <term2>bad</term2> opinion of the course.</p>

    <p><b>Orientation.</b> Our humor bushes are our overall understanding of someone or something's ability to help modulate the situation in a way that's effective and builds group cohesion.</p>
    
    <p>
