<h3 id="26-09">An overall opinion isn't based on specific comparisons</h3>

<!--
<p>Just because we have a good <term>overall</term> opinion of something doesn't mean we can't <term2>also</term2> judge it's relation toward different goals. We'll call these <vocab>goal-relations</vocab>.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <consider>For instance:</consider>
    <p>If we're trying out recipes, we may enjoy the experience of cooking and eating a meal. <callback>(Overall opinion)</callback> But then we also think about whether it's worth the time, fits in our budget, meets our dietary goals, how well it transports or freezes, and so on. <callback>(Goal-relations.)</callback></p>
    
     <p>Sometimes we care so much about a goal, that a single goal-relation dominates our overall opinion of an experience. But most time, no single goal-relation determines overall opinion.</p>
</div>

<p>Our spoken opinions usually have two parts to them. One is an overall opinion of the experience. Another is a <vocab>metric comparison</vocab>&mdash;comparing one metric to another:</p>

<p>We're often so used to making <term>metric comparisons</term> that we sometimes confuse them with our <term2>overall</term2> opinion&mdash;but a comparison may or may not overlap with our opinion, especially since there are many different comparisons we could make.  </p>

<div class="consider">

    <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>When we get pizza with our best friend and have a great conversation, we have a great time. We may have fond memories of that pizza place <callback>(overall opinion)</callback>&mdash;even if that pizza place was worse than most other pizza places in terms of quality, service, decour, and so on. <callback>(Metric comparisons.)</callback></p>

<p>If we feel fitted humor toward something, we’ll think of it positively&mdash;which isn't the same thing as saying it compares well to everything in every possible comparison.</p>
 


 <aside class="box">
     <p><b>Kids movies.</b> As kids, we grew humor bushes with the movies we watched over and over. We had a good opinion of them! Since the humor bush often continues into our adult lives, we continue having a positive opinion of those movies.</p> 
     
     <p>What happens if someone tells us those movies were low-quality compared to other kids movies of the time, and definitely low-quality compared to kids movies of today? <callback>(Metric comparison of movie qualities)</callback> We’d probably agree&mdash;but agreeing with a metric comparison <sem-weak>isn't</sem-weak> relevant to our overall opinion. Our overall opinion is a humor bush, which may or may not overlap with various metric comparisons.</p>
     
      
     
     <p>Similarly, if Zoe prefers Pittsburgh to Seattle, would Zoe change her opinion once Emma points out that Pittsburgh is poorer and smaller than Seattle? <callback>(Metric comparisons of cities wealth and population.)</callback> No&mdash;Zoe would agree with the comparison, but her overall opinion of Pittsburgh is her humor bush. <term>Comparative metrics</term> about wealth or size has nothing to do with her <term2>overall opinion</term2>, which is based on how often and intensely she feels humor family words on the topic of 'Pittsburgh.'</p>
     
     <p>We see people interchange opinions with metric comparisons all the time. <callback>"You should be happier now (overall opinion) because you're making more money (metric comparison)."</callback> But this is often disconnected reasoning&mdash;like ignoring units on an equation and expecting the results to always make sense.</p> 
     
     <div class="consider">
         <aside class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider> 
             <p>Sometimes we think our opinion <sem-weak>should</sem-weak> be based on metric comparisons, like comparative quality or comparative wealth. In this view, we'd think that everyone, everywhere, should prefer Seattle to Pittsburgh because of a select few comparative qualities.</p> 
             
             <p>Setting aside problems with picking a few metrics for that&mdash;that's not functionally how we form opinions! Our opinions are our cumulative amount of humor we feel with things, due to our emotional orientation to fitted humor.</p> 
             
             <p>This creates a fundamental starting point for thinking about opinions and the relevance of metric comparisons.</p>  </aside>
