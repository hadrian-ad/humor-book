<h3 id="27-04">We have a universal preference for learning with humor</h3>


<p>Since we learn from feeling humor, all things being equal we have a universal preference for learning materials that make us feel humor:

        <p><speaker>Host:</speaker> <speech>“Helicopter pilots are expensive to maintain for militaries, because it’s a demanding job! It’s hard. I mean, think about video games. Video games use very, very simplified controls for vehicles. But even in these games, the vehicle you’re most likely to crash is a helicopter!”</speech></p>

        <p><speaker>Host:</speaker> <speech>“Point being, rotary-wing assets are expensive to maintain, both from maintaining the equipment and skills needed to use them. So why don’t countries get rid of them? Well, until you have something that can do their task better, you’re kind of stuck with them. If you’re deploying soldiers mountain top to mountain top, your choice is either donkeys or helicopter&mdash;and until that changes, most militaries will stick with helicopters, no matter their expense.”</speech></p>

<p>We always trend toward the documentaries, non-fiction books, podcasts, and so on that we hope will make us feel <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>If we’re using something to learn that <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> let us feel <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on&mdash;we give them up or resent them.</p>

    alt="This figure shows there sizes of humor bush on a dress code graph. One is below dress code, another is larger than the dress code, but the middle is just right. An annotation says that, given a choice, we'll always choose a method of learning that we hope will lead to a fitted humor bush."
    title="Choices"
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >
    


<p>This is why we have a universal preference for the option of learning that produces more fitted humor.</p> 


<p>Trevor will avoid the think tank report <callback>(no humor)</callback>, books for children <callback>(no humor)</callback>, and choose something that makes him feel humor on relevant topics&mdash;something that helps him learn.</p>

     
        <div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        
        
         <p>We learn on the <em>specific topic</em> that generates humor. That means we don't have a preference for the most humor <term>generally</term>, but the most humor <term2>specifically</term2> <callback>(on the topic we want to learn about)</callback>.</p>
         
         <p  class="considertext">So if Trevor is interested in military helicopters, he wants to feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, and so on&mdash;specifically <term>on</term> topics related to ‘military helicopters,’ and not <term2>off</term2>-topic on things like ‘apples’ or ‘fantasy novels.’</p>
        
        <p>This is why we have a preference for <em>fitted</em> humor. If a podcast makes Trevor feel humor by making irrelevant asides on apples or fantasy novels, the humor will be unfitted&mdash;since his humor isn't on relevant topics. He'll be incorporating new framings&mdash;just not on what he’s trying to learns</p> </aside> 
    </div>



 
<aside class="box"><p><b>Quality.</b> Sometimes we think the amount we learn isn’t tied to our frequency and intensity of fitted humor, but instead to the quality of information that's presented. But that's obviously not quite right when we think about it.</p> 
    
    <p>If a kid can't read, it would help them learn much to give them a 500 page report&mdash;no matter how immaculate the report's anaylis is. Similarly, giving a 500 page report to an unmotivated adult <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> won't help them learn much on that topic.</p> 
    
    <p>Since it's not the quality of information alone that determines learning, it's instead the relation of the person to the content that determines learning&mdash;not content by itself. This is why how much someone gets a technical report depends on the user.</p> 
            
    <p><term>Trevor</term> may feel more humor from the <term>podcast</term>&mdash;but a <term2>defense economist</term2> may feel more humor from the <term2>think tank report</term2>. That’s because a defense economist would have the context to see a graph showing a 4.3% increase in global expenditure on rotary-wing aircraft as a mistake that's OK, and feel <emotions>insight</emotions> or <emotions>realization</emotions>&mdash;while Trevor won't.</p>
