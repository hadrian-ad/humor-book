     <p>In this chapter, we'll be looking at the <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> to <term>when</term> and <term2>why</term2> we feel humor. We can put this pattern most simply as:</p> 


<p class="lesson">
   Humor is mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
</p>

<p>
    We'll explain this in detail soon. But first, we can look at examples to get a general sense of how this pattern works:

<p>
    In each example, someone felt humor or not based on their evaluation of a mistake as OK or not OK.
    </p>
    

    
<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as OK.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    We're using words like "mistake" and "OK" in new ways. We'll be looking more precisely at what these words mean over the next few sections.
