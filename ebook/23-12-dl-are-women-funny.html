<p>In places and times that low-ranked women, it was generally agreed that most women were inferior to most men in things like civic awareness, courage, intelligence, industry, morality, leadership, rationality&mdash;and to boot, women weren’t very funny either. </p>

<p>Of course, it wasn’t just that women weren’t funny&mdash;women were the <term>opposite</term> of funny: they were killjoys, nagging, shrewish, shrill, thin-skinned, vain, and so on. But to cover all the bases, women were also seen as the <term2>opposite</term2> <outcome-contrast>opposite</outcome-contrast> of funny too: too caring, delicate, empathetic, moral, nurturing, observant, sensitive, sentimental, thoughtful, virtuous, and so on. </p>

<p>In other words, those societies saw women as bad at humor from both ends, even in incoherent and contradictory ways.</p>

<p>Through a variety of mechanisms, women in these societies were excluded from major roles in for-profit spectator entertainment, including as actors, directors, columnists, comedians, comics, screenwriters, radio jockeys, and so on&mdash;which created feedback loops of superficial confirmation of prejudices about women and humor.</p>

    <p>In addition, the spectator entertainment that was popular with women-majority demographics was belittled and trivialized, so that the period dramas, romantic comedies, romances, sitcoms, soap operas, and so on that were almost exclusively watched by women weren’t seen as having good or worthwhile humor attempts.</p>
    
    <p>This was in contrast to the spectator entertainment that was also popular with men, which was seen as good&mdash;as having greater authenticity, civic-worth, cultural value, daring, status, vivacity, and so on.</p>
</div>

<p>The prejudices that led to excluding and belittling women have had a long life. We can see the stereotypes that pretended to justify this exclusion being both mocked and winked at in a in a 2001 episode of <i>Futurama</i>:</p>

<p>In the scene, the men discuss what they use to assess how good humor attempts are. For them, good humor was <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> boring and <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> primarily based on character or realistic situations. In this book, this is loosely similar to a preference for intensity, instead of fittedness.</p> 

<p>Without really ever thinking about it, many of us have absorbed the idea that intensity is the only important&mdash;or even the only possible&mdash;measure of humor. This is why we sometimes think that “good” humor is either gloriously stupid <callback>(“ice to see you”)</callback>, or something that pushes the envelope. <callback>(“I know I’m not supposed to say it, but…”)</callback> We sometimes don’t think there <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> be any other kind of good humor.</p>

<p>There’s obviously nothing wrong with enjoying and celebrating things that prioritize intensity of humor. Instead, the problem comes when we lose the ability to see that other measures of humor exist&mdash;and can exist concurrently. We can maybe feel this ourselves in this chapter, where “charm” is something that’s both incredibly obvious and also hard to wrap our heads around.</p>

<p>All throughout our day-to-day lives, charm has been common, effective, enjoyable, familiar, memorable, normal, nice, powerful, versatile, and so on. Even so, we’ve often never really had a name for it&mdash;and it’s frequently been invisible because of it!</p>

<p>But as we start seeing fittedness as existing concurrently with intensity, our ability to use humor will become more capable and more in accord to the world around us.</p>

<p>Humor and humor attempts have two values: intensity and fittedness. We can weight these values in different ways. This gives us a variety of ways to judge and compare humor and humor attempts. 
</p>


<ul>
<li>We can give more weight to intensity <callback>(comedy)</callback> or to fittedness <callback>(charm)</callback>.</li>
   
    <li>
    We often ignore low-intensity humor. But if we weight fittedness highly, low-intensity humor can become more significant.</li>
    
    <li>Fitted humor is an <a href="18-06-charm-is-an-outcome-not-method.html">outcome</a>, not a method. There are many methods to create fitted humor.
