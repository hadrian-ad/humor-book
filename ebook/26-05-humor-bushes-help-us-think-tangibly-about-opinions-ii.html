<h3 id="26-05">Humor bushes allow comparisons</h3>




<p>To think more about how our opinion is based on humor bushes, we can compare two variations of Heather&mdash;one that frequently generates low-intensity humor, and the other that doesn’t: </p>

<p>Both Heather 1 and Heather 2 are teaching the exact same content. Students would have a <em>higher</em> opinion of the heather than overall grows a larger humor bush.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
    
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>While we looked at <callback>“Heather 1 and Heather 2,”</callback> we can do the same thing with any comparison&mdash;like between <callback>“PE teacher #1 and PE teacher #2,”</callback> <callback>“social studies class and math class,”</callback> <callback>"middle school and high school,"</callback> and so on.</p>
        
        
        <p>In any comparison, students will have a high opinion of the things they have a large, fitted humor bush with, and have a low opinion of things they don’t.</p>
</aside> </div>


<p>If students have a well-fitted humor bush in a class, they’ll remember that class or teacher as effective, enjoyable, fun, great, recommendable, and so on. If the students <em>don’t</em> have a well-fitted humor bush in a class, they’ll remember the class or teacher as controlling, creepy, dull, off, weird, and so on.</p>

<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Unfitted.</b> Sometimes teachers annoy us when they ignore fittedness and focus on intensity. This can happen when they  intuitively know how important humor is, but don't have a strong ability or understanding of fitted humor.</p>
    
    <p>In these cases, we can see their humor attempts as wasting time with things like comics, funny voices, pointless games, long gimmicks, wisecracks, cringy videos, and so on. This isn't a problem with <term>humor</term>, though&mdash;we're not feeling humor, but <term2>annoyance</term2>! The teacher has a problem with irritation, not humor.</p> 
    
    <p>Even if we did laugh, we can still censure them&mdash;since we felt their humor attempts don't meet or exceed our sense of the situation's standard of efficiency and cohesion. We found it irrelevant and time-consuming!</p> 
    
    
    <p>If a teacher wants to build a humor bush with their students, the teacher will have to not be censured by frustration or disapproval.</p> 
    
    
    
    <div class="consider"><aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
            <p>Dress codes are one reason teachers can't act like our friends. Since they're our teacher, our need for efficiency and cohesion goes up&mdash;our dress code goes up!</p>
            
              
         <p>This means we censure humor attempts from our teachers that we would tolerate in our friends&mdash;and teachers that try be our friend are making a fundamental error in how our interactions work.</p>
