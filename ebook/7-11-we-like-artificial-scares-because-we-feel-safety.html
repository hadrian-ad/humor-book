    We like artificial scares because we feel <emotions>safety</emotions>
</h2>
  
<p>
	One reason we sometimes like being artificially scared is that we feel
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>
	
	 afterwards&mdash;we feel humor.

        <p>
            This is part of the appeal of something like bungee jumps, haunted houses, jump scares, movie gore, pranks, peek-a-boo, pretend injury, roller coasters, horror films, and so on&mdash;we can feel humor from them! 
        </p>

<p>
	If we transition from a mistake-predominant emotion into
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>,
	
	 we’ll be feeling humor&mdash;if we don’t  feel <emotions>safety</emotions>, we won’t feel humor:
