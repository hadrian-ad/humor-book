    <h3 id="22-02">Dress codes and censure are always present</h3>
    
   
<p>While dress codes and censure are obvious in extreme examples <callback>(abandoning attention to mission control versus not)</callback>, the same dynamic happens all across our lives.</p>    
    
    <p>Dress codes and censure are why groups often can censure as a group, like when we:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>encounter awkward pauses around the dinner table</li>
        <li>exchange looks with each other when the teacher makes an uncomfortable joke</li>
        <li>find everyone dismissive of our social media post</li>
        <li>find random pointless stories from our spouse fun, but random pointless stories from the guy in the line in front of us annoying</li>
        <li>cringe when watching an uncomfortable scene in a comedy</li>
        <li>make eye contact with others when someone is weird in public</li>
        <li>share looks with passengers when someone is laughing on the bus too loudly</li>
        <li>know who in the group everyone finds irritating</li>
        <li>register who is censuring who in a meeting</li>
           
           <li>
            find our post censured online by immediate consensus</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
        
<p>In all these cases, some people have arrived at an shared understanding of the humor dress code&mdash;which gives them a shared basis to censure someone breaking the dress code.</p>

          <p><b>Censure.</b> “Censure” and “censor” are similar sounding words that mean different things. To <term>censure</term> is to <term>condemn</term>, while to <term2>censor</term2> is to <term2>suppress communication</term2>.</p>

                  <li>if a group of academics publish a letter condemning us, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li> 
                  
                  <li>If our parents are furious we mimed something behind Grandma's back, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li> 
                  <li>If people on social media react poorly to the joke we posted, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li> 
                  
                  <li>If our friend vaguely smiles at our joke in a way we feel is unenthusiastic, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li>

<li>If a forum blots out swear words, the forum has <strong>censored</strong> those words.</li> 
                             
                             <li>If the sound engineers cut our mic halfway through our speech, we have been <strong>censored</strong>.</li>

          <p>While censure and censor are overlapping concepts, generally, <term>censure</term> comes from <term>within</term> emotion networks, in the form of desynchronization&mdash;while <term2>censorship</term2> comes from <term2>outside</term2> an emotion network, as something imposed from without.</p>
