<p>In the examples above, we'll call this humor as good or bad depending on which measure we're prioritizing:</p> 




<ul class="close-list">
   <li>If we judge first by <term>intensity</term>, then these would be bad to okay moments of humor.</li>
    
    <li>If we judge first by <term2>fittedness</term2>, these would all be okay to good moments humor.</li>
    </ul> 
    
 

  

  
<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider> 
        <p>The point here isn't that we have to pick just one measure. The point is instead to notice that there <sem-weak>are</sem-weak> multiple measures to humor&mdash;which allows for multiple kinds of judgement.</p>
           
                   <p>Discussions of humor can seem dimensionless and flat if we only have <term>one</term> measure for humor <callback>(intensity)</callback>. We can create some depth perception to how we think about humor by adding in a <term2>second</term2> measure <callback>(fittedness)</callback>.</p>

      <p><b>Nameless.</b> In the examples above, people cared about fittedness first, and intensity second.</p> 
       
      <ul class="close-list">
            <li>Lina <em>foremost</em> was hoping the fable would make her feel wiser <callback>(which was why she was reading fables and not an anthology of Sunday comics)</callback></li>
             
             <li>Cyrus was <em>foremost</em> hoping his soldiers would feel convinced and satisfied <callback>(which was why he argued with and flattered them, instead of just drinking merrily with them)</callback></li>
             
             <li>Trevor was <em>foremost</em> hoping to feel some kind of catharsis or relief by talking with Minh <callback>(which was why he hoped Minh would take him seriously, not joke about being bored)</callback></li>
             
             <li>Zoe <em>foremost</em> wanted Trevor to feel included <callback>(which was why she brought him the burrito, instead of teasing him for his bad luck not having a burrito)</callback></li>
