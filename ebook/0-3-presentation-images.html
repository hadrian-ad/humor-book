<p>We can see this old meaning of clown in an old nursery rhyme, where clown-as-peasant is contrasted with a gentleman:</p>  
    <div class="text-example">    
            <p>Shall I marry a gentleman? /<br>
                Shall I marry a clown? / <br>
                Or shall I marry old Knives-and-Scissors / <br>
                Shouting through the town?</p>

       <p>Things designed to produce smiles or laugh have a connection to perspective, framing, or realizations&mdash;which is often obvious in jokes:</p>
       
<div class="text-example">
           <p>Two young priests went up to a cardinal to ask a question.</p> 
           <p>The first priest said: "Are we allowed to smoke while praying?".</p> 
           <p>Flabbergasted, the cardinal said: "Absolutely not!"</p>
           <p>The second priest turned to the other and said: "It's how you phrase the question... Cardinal, is it ok to pray while we smoke?"</p>
           <p>Pleased, the cardinal said: "Absolutely!"</p>
