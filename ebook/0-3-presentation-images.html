        The word "clown" originally meant "peasant," or someone without aristocratic manners. Eventually, the word clown evolved from meaning peasant to meaning <i>"someone who drew your laughter, by habits or profession."</i>
           </p>

<p>We can see this historical meaning of clown in an old nursery rhyme, where a gentleman is contrasted with a peasant <callback>("clown")</callback>:</p>  
    <div class="poem">    
            <p>Shall I marry a gentleman?</p>
<p>Shall I marry a clown?</p>
                <p>Or shall I marry old Knives-and-Scissors</p>
                <p>Shouting through the town?</p>
