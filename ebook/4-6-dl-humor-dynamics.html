<p>We can think of this book as being about <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>&mdash;that is, thinking about how humor <term>evolves</term> in people over time, and how that <term2>affects</term2> people.</p>
            
                       
<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">     
<consider>Consider</consider>
                <p>This is the difference between looking at a joke in a book <callback>(out of time)</callback>, and looking at how someone actually <sem-weak>reacts</sem-weak> to that joke <callback>(over time)</callback>.</p> </aside>        
         </div> 
             
<p>The goal of humor dynamics is to move beyond seeing humor as "on" or "off"&mdash;and move into seeing humor as something that flows and integrates into broader systems.</p>
              
<p>This is a bit like moving from arithmetic to algebra, from rivers to water basins, from gardens to ecology, and so on. These are alterations of focus designed to guide us down increasingly elegant paths of thinking about the world.</p> 
  
<p>More broadly, in humor dynamics, <em>humor</em> is the focal point for understanding our emotional systems. This is something we'll be spending the rest of the book exploring piece-by-piece.</p>

    Our evaluations
    <callback>(mistakes, OKs)</callback> aren't static&mdash;our evaluations <vocab>change over time</vocab>. This lets us plot the magnitude of mistakes and OKs over time. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        We always have a ratio of mistake and OK, which always produces emotions. However, this ratio only sometimes produce humor. By focusing on mistakes and OKs, we can see humor<strong><a href="4-1-our-evaluations-change-continuously.html">
                coming from somewhere</a></strong>, rather than nowhere. 
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        When the <strong><a href="4-4-we-can-feel-ok-predominant-or-mistake-predominant-emotions.html">
                ratio of mistakes and OKs <em>isn't</em> 1</a></strong>, our evaluations are either mistake-predominant <callback>(mistake is larger than OK)</callback> or OK-predominant <callback>(OK is larger than mistake)</callback>.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
       Our evaluational ratio falls into and move between  <strong><a href="4-5-emotions-are-somewhere-in-relation-to-these-three-zones.html">
               three emotional zones</a></strong>: OK-predominant evaluations; balanced evaluations <callback>(humor)</callback>; and mistake-predominant evaluations. These zones blend into each other and don't have hard boundaries.
    </li>
</ul>
