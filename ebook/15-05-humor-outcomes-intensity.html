<p>When Emma dodges down the hall, she feels she <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>. But since her humor wasn’t particularly long-lasting or intense, Emma didn’t <em>intensely</em> feel she <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>.</p>

<p>By contrast, if Emma realizes there had <em>never</em> been any potential conflict, so that she feels she <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>completely avoided</outcome-contrast> conflict</humor-outcome>&mdash;she feels more intense humor for longer.</p>

    <p><b>Modification.</b> We can always change the language of a humor outcome to reflect a change in intensity:

     <p>To keep things readable in this book, we'll just use static phrases for humor outcomes&mdash;but we can often be more accurate by using either milder or more intense phrasing on a case-by-case basis.</p>
    </aside>


    
    <!--
    <p>At the same time, <em>all</em> humor outcomes always describe <em>all</em> moments of humor in a loose, poetic sense&mdash;like how <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to something like <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>&mdash;or how <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>&mdash;or how <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> is interestingly similar to <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>&mdash;and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>These phrases interlock and overlap because they’re different ways of describing the same thing: humor.</p>
