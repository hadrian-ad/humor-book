	Last chapter, we saw that we evaluate mistakes and OKs as having a <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-1-mistakes-have-a-size.html">size</a>. In this chapter, we’ll look more at how these sizes <vocab>change over time</vocab>. 
</p>
<p>
	As our evaluations change, the intensity of humor changes:
</p>
    <div class="vignette">
     <blockquote>
               <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin are playing a board game. Yasmin is about to win until she has a catastrophically bad turn.</narration></p>

        </blockquote>
        </div>	 
<p>
	The intensity of Trevor and Yasmin’s humor changes because their evaluations change.

    </aside>
	    </div>
	    
	    <p>
	We can look at more examples of evaluations changing over time:
</p>
<div class="vignette">

    title="Tracking the size of mistake over time"
    alt="This timeline shows mistakes (represented as squares) changing size over time. When the instrument breaks, there's a mistake. When Hana hears how expensive the instrument was, the mistake gets even larger. After thinking about it, the mistake gets smaller."
    style="max-width: 23rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
	
   <div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>

    style="max-width: 18rem; margin-top: 1rem;">
<p>
	Since we evaluate mistakes and OKs <vocab>continuously</vocab>, we can graph their change over time: 
</p>
<img
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-0-continuity/4-0-2-mistake-and-ok-over-time.png"
    title="Representing the change in the magnitude of mistake and OK as a line"
    alt="This image shows the previous two timelines of mistake and OK, but converts the changing size of squares into a graphs. On these graphs, the size of mistake and OK is the y axis, and the time is the x axis. One graph shows the size of mistake rise and fall as a dotted line, and another shows the size of OK continuously shrink as a solid line."
    style="max-width: 38rem;">

<p>
	We can put mistakes and OKs on the same graph:
</p>
   <div class="vignette">
    
   <blockquote>
         <p><narration>Then Owen leans over and tells Emma a joke.</narration></p> 
            <p><narration>She laughs.</narration></p> 
            <p><narration>Then she doesn't.</narration></p>
    </blockquote> 
   
    </div>
<img 
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-0-continuity/4-0-3-mistake-and-ok-over-time-together.png"
    title="Graphing mistakes and OKs together."
    alt="This image has our timelines for mistake and OK squares stacked on top of each other, with an arrow showing time. Below, this is re-represented as a graph. There's a straight solid line for the OK, with a dotted line for mistake rising from 0 up to touch the OK line before decreasing again. An arrow points out where the two lines meet, and says 'humor occurs when the lines for mistaken and OK meet'"
    style="max-width: 30rem;">
<p>
	This lets us graph the intensity of humor too. The intensity of humor <term>increases</term> the <term>closer</term> the mistake and OK are to touching <callback>(balancing)</callback>&mdash;and <term2>decreases</term2> the <term2>further away</term2> they get. This is why the intensity of humor tends to increase, peak, and then decrease:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Owen leans over and tells Emma a joke.</narration></p> 
        <p><narration>She laughs.</narration></p> 
        <p><narration>Then she doesn't.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s humor increases and then decreases in intensity)</notes>
    </p>

    title="The intensity of humor is greatest when the mistake and OK are closest"
    alt="This graph again has size of evaluations as the y axis, and time as the x axis. There are again two lines for mistake and OK. This graph adds a third line: a dotted line representing the intensity of humor. This line grows or shrinks based on how close the lines for mistake and OK are."
    style="max-width: 30rem;">
<p>
	We’ll talk about this throughout this chapter. 
</p>

  <h2 id="4-01">
Evaluations change continuously 
</h2>

<p>
	We can see evaluations <term>change</term> over a few <term>seconds</term>, like when Owen tells Emma a joke. But we can also look at evaluations <term2>change</term2> over a period of <term2>months</term2> or <term2>years</term2>: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
      <blockquote>
            <p>
            <narration>Middle school Zoe has a huge crush on Ryan from the boy’s track team. She keeps trying to start a text conversation with him, until he finally gets annoyed.</narration> <speech>“Stop texting me,”</speech> <narration>he writes her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels this is an enormous mistake)</notes></p> 
            
            <p><narration>Zoe’s grin fades and she puts down her phone and curls over her legs from shame.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels this is a tiny OK)</notes>
               </p>
       </blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>
	We can arbitrarily assign numbers to Zoe’s mistakes and OKs to think about how Zoe’s evaluations change over time:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
       <blockquote>
           <p><strong>A.</strong> <narration>Middle school Zoe is devastated by the rejection.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels this is a mistake of 10 with an OK of 1)</notes></p>
            <p><strong>B.</strong> <narration>Two months later, Zoe still wants her parents to move to another country.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 10, OK 2)</notes></p>
            <p><strong>C.</strong> <narration>Two month later, Zoe still wants to transfer schools.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 10, OK 3)</notes>
            </p>
            <p><strong>D.</strong> <narration>Two months later, Zoe still wants to drop out of track.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 10, OK 4)</notes></p>
            <p><strong>E. </strong><narration>Two months later, Zoe still wonders how she could have been so stupid.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 9, OK 5)</notes></p>
            <p><strong>F. </strong> <narration>Two months later, the text conversation crosses Zoe’s mind. It wasn’t such a big deal after all, was it? She gives a loud laugh, suddenly feeling cleansed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 5, OK 5&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
       </blockquote>
      
        </div>
<p>
	At this point, the humor peaks, since the size of the mistakes and OKs match. But we don't have to stop at the peak of intensity&mdash;we can keep thinking about Zoe’s evaluations for as long as we think would be useful:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>G.</strong> <narration>Two months later, if Zoe thinks of it, she smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 4, OK 6)</notes></p>
            <p><strong>H.</strong> <narration>Two months later, if for some reason it crosses her mind, it amuses her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 4, OK 7)</notes></p>
            <p><strong>I.</strong> <narration>Two months later, Zoe is reading an article online about making sense of bad feelings, and she makes another realization. </narration><notes>(&larr; mistake 2, OK 10)</notes></p>
            <p><narration>Zoe smiles at the realization&mdash;but the event itself is now outside the bounds of humor and completely in the past. If she thinks of it again, she feels something other than humor.</narration></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>

<img
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-1-our-evaluations-change-continuously/4-1-0-zoe-ryan-over-time.png"
    title="More practice with our graphs"
    alt="This image has three graphs stacked on top of each other, tracking Zoe's evaluations over time. The three graphs disambiguate the plotted components (OK, mistake, and intensity of humor) to help the reader practice reading these evaluation graphs. They show the intensity of humor peaking where Zoe's mistake and OK is in balance at moment F."
    style="max-width: 37rem;">

<p>
	If we <em>only</em> track the intensity of humor, the humor can seem to come from nowhere and then vanish. But when we instead focus on mistakes and OKs, we can see humor as emerging and disappearing predictably from two continuous and interacting measures. 
</p>
 
 
<h2 id="4-02">
   Visualizing humor
</h2>
  <!-- 04.20 -->
  
<p>Humor is felt most intensely when the size of the mistake and OK are balanced. This lets us see humor grow in intensity, peak, and then decline in intensity:</p>

<img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/4c-images-continuity/4-2-how-we-will-visualize-humor-in-this-book/4-2-0-where-humor-peaks-on-graph.png"
    title="Humor peaks where our two inputs meet"
    alt="This image has three evaluation graphs stacked on each other, again to practice reading them. In these graphs, the line for mistake crosses and re-crosses the line for OK. Arrows point out that these crosses represent moments of intense humor where evaluations have briefly balanced in size."
    style="max-width: 32rem;">

<p>These graphs let us see at a glance when humor is felt, and how intensely. Someone feels humor whenever the lines for mistake and OK are close to each other.</p>

	 
<h2 id="4-03">
What do people feel when not feeling humor?
</h2>
 
 <!-- 04.30 -->
 
 
<p>
	When the size of mistakes and OKs are close to balanced, we feel humor. When they're <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> balanced, we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> feel humor.
	</p>
	
<p>
	But there are two ways these scales can not be balanced. The scales can either be <vocab>mistake-predominant</vocab> <callback>(mistake is larger than the OK)</callback> or <vocab>OK-predominant</vocab> <callback>(OK is larger than the mistake)</callback>:
</p>

    title="Demonstrating mistake-predominance and OK-predominance"
    alt="This image puts all our various graphs together. At the top is our flowchart, with a mistake box at the top flowing into OK boxes that are either smaller, the same, or larger. Each outcome is re-represented as the balance of scales, where the scales are either tipping toward the larger mistake, balancing, or tipping toward the larger OK. Each state is then re-represented below on our evaluation graph. When the line for mistake is above the line for OK, we're 'mistake-predominant'. When the lines are closed, we're 'balanced' and feel humor. When the line for OK is above the line for mistake we're 'OK-predominant."
    style="max-width: 40rem;">

<p>
	Above, someone starts with mistake-predominant evaluations, moves into humor, and then moves into OK-predominant evaluations. 
</p>
<p>
	This lets us describe different parts of the emotional situation over time&mdash;not just when there <term>is</term> humor, but also when there's <term2>not</term2> humor:

    title="Our evaluation graphs let us see what people are feeling when they are not feeling humor"
    alt="This evaluation graph has a grey bar around the line for OK, showing that there's a blurred division of humor between mistake-predominant and OK-predominant. When the line for mistake is in this bar, someone is feeling at least some humor. When the line for mistake is above or below this bar, they're mistake-predominant or OK-predominant."

    <p>We've used numbers to think about the size of mistakes and OKs&mdash;but our goal wasn't to imply precision, but to show that these evaluations are fluid. Once we accomplish that goal and see evaluations as fluid and changing, the numbers aren't so important.</p>
       
    <p>In the rest of the book we won't use numbers for mistakes and OKs. Our evaluations will be informally described as <callback>"small,"</callback> <callback>"medium,"</callback> or <callback>"large,"</callback> and our graphs will be informal and sketch-like.</p>

<h2 id="4-04">
Emotions are either OK-predominant or mistake-predominant</h2>

<!-- 04.40 -->

<p>Our evaluations have three emotional configurations&mdash;three <vocab>emotional zones</vocab></p>

<p>There is a <em>mistake-predominant zone</em>, where the <term>mistake</term> is larger than the <term>OK</term>. There's also the <em>OK-predominant zone</em>, where the <term2>OK</term2> is larger than the <term2>mistake</term2>.</p>
<p>
	These zones are separated by when these two evaluations are balanced: the <em>balanced zone</em>&mdash;humor:

    alt="This figure shows our table, and then an arrow shows the abstraction of the table we'll use in this book.

    style="max-width: 34rem;">

<p>
	The line of highest-intensity humor is like a watershed line: on either side of it, the humor starts to change one of two ways&mdash;into either OK-predominant emotions or mistake-predominant emotions.
</p>
    
	<h3>Humor into mistake-predominance</h3>
	
	<div class="h3"><p>
	    While the mistake and OK balance, we feel intense humor. But if the mistake grows or the OK shrinks, we head toward the <em>mistake-predominant zone</em>:

	    <p>
	    As we head into the mistake-predominant zone, our emotional state contains less humor and more and more  mistake-predominant emotions, like <emotions>afraid</emotions>, <emotions>ashamed</emotions>, <emotions>bummed</emotions>, <emotions>confused</emotions>, <emotions>excited</emotions>, <emotions>irritated</emotions>, <emotions>focused</emotions>, <emotions>grieving</emotions>, <emotions>perplexed</emotions>, <emotions>jealous</emotions>, <emotions>sad</emotions>, <emotions>stressed</emotions>, <emotions>terrified</emotions>, <emotions>worried</emotions>, <i>and so on</i>.</p>

	This helps us see humor as part of the same emotional landscape as other emotions. Humor isn’t <term>apart</term> from other emotions&mdash;instead, it has a specific place: humor is sandwiched <term2>between</term2> emotions like anger and calm.

            It can seem odd that we sometimes laugh before moments of apathy and also sometimes laugh before moments of terror. But it’s not odd when we think of humor as equally adjacent to both apathy and terror. 
            </p>

	When we cross between these two emotional zones, humor “rings”&mdash;like how a convenience store bell rings whenever the door is opened, whether someone is going in or out. 
</p>
<p>
	In this way, humor rings on the way to terror, the same way humor rings on our way to apathy:

    alt="This evaluation graph shows the mistake going from far below the OK (apathy) to far above the OK (terror) and back again to terror, pointing out how humor marks these transitions."
    style="max-width: 31rem;">

<p>
	If we’re in a convenience store, we can ring the bell by opening the door&mdash;but then not go through the door. We can do the same with humor, where humor rings, but we don’t change which zone we’re in:

    alt="This evaluation graph shows a mistake dipping toward an OK and producing humor without crossing the OK."
    style="max-width: 24rem;">
<p>
	We can also open and close the convenience store door repeatedly to keep dinging the bell. We can do something similar for humor too:

	We’ll be using this way of thinking about our emotions <callback>(three emotional zones)</callback> throughout this book&mdash;which will let us keep our thinking organized when interpreting humor.

<p>We can think of this book as being about <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>&mdash;that is, thinking about how humor <term>evolves</term> in people over time, and how that <term2>affects</term2> people.</p>

         </div> 
             
<p>The goal of humor dynamics is to move beyond seeing humor as "on" or "off"&mdash;and move into seeing humor as something that flows and integrates into broader systems.</p>
              
<p>This is a bit like moving from arithmetic to algebra&mdash;or from rivers to water basins&mdash;or from gardens to ecology. These are alterations of focus designed to guide us down increasingly elegant paths of thinking about the world.</p> 
  
<p>More broadly, in humor dynamics, <em>humor</em> is the focal point for understanding our emotional systems. This is something we'll be spending the rest of the book exploring piece-by-piece.</p>

    Our evaluations
    <callback>(mistakes, OKs)</callback> aren't static&mdash;our evaluations <vocab>change over time</vocab>. This lets us plot the magnitude of mistakes and OKs over time. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        We always have a ratio of mistake and OK, which always produces emotions. However, this ratio only sometimes produce humor. By focusing on mistakes and OKs, we can see humor<strong><a href="4-1-our-evaluations-change-continuously.html">
                coming from somewhere</a></strong>, rather than nowhere. 
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        When the <strong><a href="4-4-we-can-feel-ok-predominant-or-mistake-predominant-emotions.html">
                ratio of mistakes and OKs <em>isn't</em> 1</a></strong>, our evaluations are either mistake-predominant <callback>(mistake is larger than OK)</callback> or OK-predominant <callback>(OK is larger than mistake)</callback>.
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
       Our evaluational ratio falls into and move between  <strong><a href="4-5-emotions-are-somewhere-in-relation-to-these-three-zones.html">
               three emotional zones</a></strong>: OK-predominant evaluations; balanced evaluations <callback>(humor)</callback>; and mistake-predominant evaluations. These zones blend into each other and don't have hard boundaries.
