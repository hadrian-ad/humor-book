<h3 id="26-07">Constancy can bulid large humor bushes</h3>


<p>Steady humor can grow a larger humor bush than does intermittent but intense humor:</p>

    alt="This figure compares two evaluation graphs. One shows two spikes of intensity of humor, the other shows a consistent but lower intensity of humor. The area underneath representing the humor bush is larger, in this case, for the lower but constant humor."

<p>Above, two spikes of intense humor doesn't outperform the consistent humor at growing a humor bush.</p>

<p>If Heather wants to grow a humor bush, she could begin and end her class with something that makes the class laugh&mdash;two spikes of high-intensity humor. On the other hand, she could instead open the windows&mdash;which would let the students feel consistent low-intensity humor.</p>

    alt="This shows a time circle with humor dots in them. One has two very big dots, the other has many small dots. An annotation notes that constancy or frequency can be more important than intensity."

        <p>When a teacher opens a window and lets in some air and sounds of birds and leaves, we can imagine the class having low-intensities of <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxed postures</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, and so on. We'd be feeling consistent, low-intensity humor.</p>

<p>Heather can both tell jokes <sem-weak>and</sem-weak> open the windows, so it’s not one or the other. But it's worth noting that a teacher who never tells a single joke still has many ways of creating an environment that generates fitted humor&mdash;like by having a pleasant room.</p>

    <p>To think about how an open window contributes to a humor bush, we can think about our own room. When it's nice weather and we open the window, do we sometimes feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on? Does it <outcome-contrast>promote</outcome-contrast> opportunities to <humor-tell>brighten</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, and so on? This contributes to a humor bush.</p> 
    
    <p>If our landlord came and nailed shut the window, would we feel <outcome-contrast>less</outcome-contrast> <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on? Would it <outcome-contrast>reduce</outcome-contrast> opportunities to <humor-tell>brighten</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, and so on? This hinders a humor bush.</p>

    <p>The open window can promote low-intensities of humor. This in turn makes the window a component of our overall humor bush with things tangential to the window&mdash;whether our window opens or not changes our overall opinion of our apartment, mornings, neighborhood, and so on.</p>

    <p><b>Windows.</b> It can be unusual at first to think of windows as contributing to a humor bush. But it makes more sense when we look at an open window in a public restroom:</p>

    <p>Above, the the towel dispenser has been put near an window with wooden trim, which overlooks a forest and lake. A flowering plant has been tended so that it hangs over the window. Anyone using the towels can look out the open window.</p> 
    
    <p>If we imagine being here, we may feel low-intensities of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. We may <humor-tell>brighten</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, and so on. The humor bush constitutes our good opinion of this bathroom relative to other public bathrooms.</p>
