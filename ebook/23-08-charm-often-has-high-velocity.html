<p>We saw before how low-velocity comments don't always reach humor outcomes in complicated situations.</p> 

<p>That's why charm often involves <a href="18-00-we-can-push-toward-humor-tripwires-fast-or-slowly.html">high-velocity</a> toward humor outcomes:</p>

    alt="This comparative tripwire image shows a high-velocity ball breaking through a guard to reach the humor tripwire, next to one where a low-velocity ball bounces off the gurad. An annotation notes 'sometimes a high velocity humor attempt reaches humor outcomes, where a 'nicer' variation doesn't."

<p>If the tutor used less velocity, Zoe may have defended those tripwires and not have felt fitted humor. The “nicer” version may have been worse charm!</p>
