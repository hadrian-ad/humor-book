    <p>
            <narration>He races inside, locks the door, and breathes a sigh of relief. “Phew. We made it, Zod.

	Above, Trevor feels humor&mdash;his mistake and OK balance. In context, we can describe this humor as <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
<p>

Things like close calls, pressing deadlines, high-risk gambles, physical danger, or so on often cause us to feel mistake-predominant emotions. But when these mistakes balance with an OK, we've moved from <emotions>fear</emotions> to <emotions>safety</emotions>&mdash;we feel <emotions>humor</emotions>:

	When Justin gets up, he and Heather giggle with “relief.”
	
		 <emotions>Relief</emotions>
	
	 is another humor family word. Since
	
		<emotions>relief</emotions>
	
	 and
	
		<emotions>safety</emotions>
	
	 are context-specific variations of the word humor, both are fine to use simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
	Humor family words overlap because they’re describing the same thing: <emotions>humor</emotions>. This is why it usually feels accurate to use more than one humor family word to describe the same emotional experience:

        <p><b>Merging and overlap.</b> When Zoe returns to a warm apartment on a rainy day and smiles, we can describe her emotions as <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. The reason these humor family words overlap with each other is because they're describing the same emotional experience&mdash;<emotions>humor</emotions>:</p>

                <p>	We don't have to struggle to pick just one humor family word&mdash;we can use as many as we feel is useful.
