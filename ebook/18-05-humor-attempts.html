<p>Velocity is one quality of an intention to generate humor. In this book, we'll call intentions to generate humor <vocab>humor attempts</vocab>.</p>

<div class="consider">
     <aside class="consider"> <p class="consider">consider:</p>
           <p>Whenever we try to make someone show humor tells, push someone into humor tripwires, feel humor family words&mdash;we're making a humor attempt.</p>  </aside>  
        
    </div>
    
<p>A humor attempt is broader than a joke. A humor attempt includes <em>everything</em>&mdash;not just the words of a joke, but also the intonation, pacing, posture, facial expression, broader situation, and so on.</p> 
         
<p>That means the joke itself would just be <sem-weak>part</sem-weak> of the humor attempt.</p>

    alt="This diagram shows a circle labled 'humor attempt,' with a smaller circle labeled 'joke' within it. An annotation says 'the joke is smaller than the overall humor attempt.'";
    title="Humor attempts";

    <p>So if a hundred people tell the same joke, they're using <term>one</term> joke but making a <term2>hundred</term2> different humor attempts&mdash;since each person would be:</p> 
    
<ul class="close-list">
        <li>talking to a different person </li>
        <li>using a different inflection</li>
        <li>have a different relation to the joke</li>
        <li>speaking at different times of day</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
   
<p>Similarly, humor attempts are <em>anything</em> that intends someone to feel humor. So bringing our partner <sem-weak>tea</sem-weak> can a humor attempt&mdash;if our intention is for them to <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell> and <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome> and experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>If our partner smiles, it's a <term>successful</term> humor attempt&mdash;if they frown with disappointment, it's an <term2>unsuccessful</term2> humor attempt. Regardless of outcome, it's still a humor attempt if we intended humor.</p>

           <consider>Consider:</consider>
         <p>Throughout this book, we'll use "humor attempts" to talk about the broad range of things that intend someone to feel humor.</p>
        
        <p>This includes things that push people toward humor outcomes. When Sam puts on his jacket to go with Jennifer, or Zoe massages Emma's shoulders&mdash;they're making humor attempts! Their goal is for Jennifer and Emma to reach humor tripwires.</p>

    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
        
        <p>Humor attempts have qualities like velocity, intended topics, participants, success or failure, and so on.

<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Relation.</headline> "Humor attempt" has less ambiguity than words like <callback>"joke"</callback> or <callback>"insult"</callback>. Someone can intend <term>grief</term> from a <term>joke</term>, just like they can intend <term2>laughter</term2> from an <term2>insult</term2>.</p> 
    
    <p>By descripting intention first, we can better characterize something without worrying about describing it with a genre word. So when the tutor says <callback>"this is terrible,"</callback> we can simply call it a humor attempt without worrying too much about words like insults or jokes.</p>  
    
       
    
     <p>More importantly, "humor attempts" gives us a way to talk collectively about <sem-weak>everything</sem-weak> we do to generate smiles or laughs. This includes the ones we don't really have names for&mdash;like bringing tea, massaging shoulders, giving sincere compliments, giving sincere criticism, and so on.</p>
