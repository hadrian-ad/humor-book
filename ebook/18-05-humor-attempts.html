    <h3 id="18-5">Humor attempts</h3>


<p>In this book, we've looked at how you can intend to make someone smile by telling them a joke <callback>("chant of my generation!")</callback> or by complimenting them <callback>("gosh you're cute")</callback> or even being rude. <callback>("This is terrible")</callback> How can we talk about all this?</p>  

<p>In this book, we'll call intentions to generate humor <vocab>humor attempts</vocab>.<p></p>

<div class="consider">
     <aside class="consider"> <consider>consider:</consider>
           <p>Whenever we try to make someone show humor tells, feel humor family words, reach humor tripwires&mdash;we're making a humor attempt.</p>  </aside>  
        
    </div>
    
<p>If a friend tells us a joke, the humor attempt is broader than just the words of that joke&mdash;it's <em>everything</em>. It's intonation, pacing, posture, facial expression, broader situation, and so on.</p> 
         
<p>That means the joke itself would just be <sem-weak>part</sem-weak> of the humor attempt.</p>

    alt="This diagram shows a circle labled 'humor attempt,' with a smaller circle labeled 'joke' within it. An annotation says 'the joke is smaller than the overall humor attempt.'"

    <p>So if a hundred people tell the same joke, they're using <term>one</term> joke but making a <term2>hundred</term2> different humor attempts&mdash;since each person would be:</p> 
    
<ul class="close-list">
        <li>talking to a different person </li>
        <li>using a different inflection</li>
        <li>have a different relation to the joke</li>
        <li>speaking at different times of day</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
   
<p>It's the same for other things that intend someone to feel humor. Bringing our partner <sem-weak>tea</sem-weak> can be part of a humor attempt&mdash;if our intention is for them to <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell> and <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome> and experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 


<div class="consider">
 <aside class="consider">
           <consider>Consider:</consider>

         <p>If our partner smiles at the tea, it's a <term>successful</term> humor attempt&mdash;if they frown with disappointment, it's an <term2>unsuccessful</term2> humor attempt. Regardless of outcome, it's still a humor attempt if we intended humor.</p> 
        
        <!--<p>Throughout this book, we'll use "humor attempts" to talk about the broad range of things that intend someone to feel humor.</p>
        
        <p>This includes things that push people toward humor outcomes. When Sam puts on his jacket to go with Jennifer, or Zoe massages Emma's shoulders&mdash;they're making humor attempts! Their goal is for Jennifer and Emma to reach humor tripwires.</p>-->
    </aside>
</div>

    
     <p>The phrase "humor attempts" gives us a way to talk collectively about <sem-weak>everything</sem-weak> we do to generate smiles or laughs&mdash; including the ones we don't really have names for, like bringing tea, massaging shoulders, giving sincere compliments, giving sincere criticism, making eye contact, and so on.</p>    

   <!-- 
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
        
        <p>Humor attempts have qualities like velocity, intended topics, participants, success or failure, and so on. 
        </p>
    </div>

<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Why do we need the phrase "humor attempt"?</b> 
    A "humor attempt" describes intention first. <callback>(To make us feel humor.)</callback> By descripting <term>intention</term> first, we don't have to worry about describing it with a <term2>genre</term2> word.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, the words <callback>"joke"</callback> or <callback>"insult"</callback> don't imply a specific intention. We can intend <term>sadness</term> from a <term>joke</term>, just like we can intend <term2>laughter</term2> from an <term2>insult</term2>.</p> 
    
     
    
    <p>So when the tutor says <callback>"this is terrible,"</callback> what matters isn't whether it's a joke or an insult&mdash;what matters is the intention. An "successful high-velocity humor attempt" will tell us more about <callback>"this is terrible"</callback> than trying to sort through words like <callback>"joke"</callback> or <callback>"insult."</callback> </p>
