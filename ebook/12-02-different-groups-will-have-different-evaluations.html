Evaluations are different for different groups
</h3>

<p>In a play, <term>characters</term> may be upset&mdash;but the <term>audience</term> may laugh. To think about why <term2>characters</term2> and <term2>spectators</term2> have different emotional outcomes, we can use mistakes and OKs:</p>


<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    
    <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer are on set, and curtains rise.</narration></p>
      
      <p><narration>Sam's character forget to buy the right cream cheese, and Jennifer's character is angry.</narration> <notes>(&larr;characters have small OK and big mistake)</notes></p>
      
      <p><narration>The audience howls with laughter at Sam's attempt to escape Jennifer's chilly rebuke.</narration> <notes>(&larr;actors have big OK and big mistake)</notes></p>
</blockquote>
    </div>

<p>It's the same thing for why things make us laugh when they happen to characters, but not to people:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
  <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Sam watches <book-title>Fired Fireman 3</book-title> on his laptop. Chief is trying to get the household ready for school, but he’s comically inept at it. As he runs to get the doorbell, he slips on a toy car left on the stairs.</narration></p> 
        
        <p><narration>Sam loves the slapstick in these things.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
        
        <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
        
      <p><narration>Sam watches Jennifer slip on a toy car left on the stairs.</narration></p>
        
        <p><narration>His heart wrenches in fear.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
   </blockquote>

<p>These diverging outcomes happen everywhere in our lives&mdash;like how we might laugh when someone steps in a puddle, even if they don't laugh.</p>

<p>What makes spectator entertainment different is that the <em>priority</em> is on spectators. This is a design priority that shapes how spectator entertainment is put together.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>What goes into a comedic play? Things that will audience laugh, not the actors. The priority shapes what is and isn't in the play.</p>
        
        <p>This is why simply laughing at someone <callback>(they stepped in a puddle)</callback> isn't spectator entertainment&mdash;in this chapter, we're looking at things that are <em>intentionally</em> designed to focus on spectators.</p>
