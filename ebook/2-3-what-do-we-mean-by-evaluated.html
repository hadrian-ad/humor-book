<h2 id="2-03">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h2>
<!--    01.30 -->

 <p>The last part of our pattern is the word <vocab>evaluated</vocab>.</p>

<p class="lesson">Humor is a mistake that’s <i>evaluated</i> as OK.</p>



    <p>The word evaluation is like a hinge, where mistakes can swivel to OK or to not-OK. This lets our pattern describe when humor does and <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> occur:</p>

      <p><headline>Models.</headline> We introduced the bones of our <term>model definition</term> of humor. A model simplifies something more complex to help us approximate, characterize, describe, or predict outcomes. This is a lot like how maps are simplifications of what they're mapping.</p>
       
       <p>But no matter how useful a map is, it’s not actually the land its mapping. Our model definition of humor is similar: it’s not humor&mdash;just a model of it. As we add to this model, it'll become increasingly useful for creating, describing, and predicting humor at a day-to-day scale of thinking.</p>
