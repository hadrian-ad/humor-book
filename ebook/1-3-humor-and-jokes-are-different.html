<h3 id="1-03">Jokes and humor are different things</h3>
   
    <p>Sometimes we think of jokes and <emotions>humor</emotions> as the same thing. But they're not&mdash;for the same reason insults and <emotions>anger</emotions> are different things.</p>
    
    <p><term>“Insult”</term> makes us think of a <term>comment</term>, while “<term2><emotions>anger</emotions></term2>” makes us think of an <term2>emotion</term2>:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-3-images/1-3-0-anger-insult.png" title="Insults and anger are different" alt="This figure shows two circles: insult (comment) and anger (emotion)." 
    style="max-width: 20rem;">
    
    <p>Insults and <emotions>anger</emotions> sometimes coincide, but they're distinct things. There can be <term>insults</term> without <emotions><term>anger</term></emotions>, just like there can be <emotions><term2>anger</term2></emotions> without <term2>insults</term2>:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-3-images/1-3-1-anger-insult-overlap.png" title="Insults and anger sometimes overlap, but are distinct" alt="This figure takes two circles, insult (comment) and anger (emotion), and overlaps them. They sometimes intersect, but they don't always."
    
    style="max-width: 18rem;">
    
    <p>It’s the same thing for jokes and <emotions>humor</emotions>. They sometimes coincide&mdash;but they’re distinct things. There can be <term>jokes</term> without <term>
        <emotions>humor</emotions></term>, and <term2><emotions>humor</emotions></term2> without <term2>jokes</term2>:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-3-images/1-3-2-humor-joke-overlap.png" title="Jokes and humor are different" alt="This figure shows a venn diagram using joke (comment) as one category, and humor (emotion) as the other. These two circles sometimes intersect, but don't always."
    
    style="max-width: 20rem;">


    <p>The complication is that we sometimes call jokes “humor.” In this case, we have the same-sounding word for <em>both</em> comments and emotions. There's humor and <emotions>humor</emotions>:</p>
    
    <img src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-3-images/1-3-3-humor-humor-overlap.png" title="Humor (comment) and humor (emotion) are different" alt="This figure evolves the pprevious venn diagram to label the circles as humor (comment) and  humor (emotion). Despite having the same name, they don't always intersect."
    
    style="max-width: 20rem;">

    
    <p>This can make us think these two things are more similar than they are. But <term>humor</term> <callback>(comment)</callback> and <term>
        <emotions>humor</emotions>
    </term> <callback>(emotion)</callback> aren’t the same thing&mdash;for the same reason <term2>insults</term2> and <term2><emotions>anger</emotions></term2> aren’t the same thing!</p>

          <p><b>Jumping.</b> We often jump between different meanings of humor, even without noticing that we do:</p>

          <p>Jessica and Emma aren't settled on a meaning for the word "humor," and it changes throughout their conversation.</p>
                 
           <p>But both Jessica and Emma laughed during this conversation&mdash;this is the "humor" <callback>(emotion)</callback> that we'll be looking at throughout this book.</p>
