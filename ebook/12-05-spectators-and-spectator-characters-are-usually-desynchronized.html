Desynchronized evaluations
</h3>

    <p>In spectator entertainment, the audience and the characters don't usually feel the same thing at the same time&mdash;their evaluations are desynchronized.</p>

            <consider>Consider:</consider> 
            
            <p>In interpersonal orientations, it's destructive to continue to laugh as someone cries. That's because there's a <term>shared priority</term> that pushes us toward synchronizing our evaluations.</p>
            
             <p>But in spectator orientations, it's not necessarily destructive to laugh as someone cries. The <term2>one-sided priority</term2> leads to desynchronized evaluations. </p>

    </div>

    <!--    
<p>In interpersonal interactions, everyone <term>converges</term> toward synchronized emotions. If one person is angry, soon either both people are angry or both people are calm <callback>(emotionally synchronized).</callback></p>

 <p>But in spectator entertainment, we often have people <term2>diverging</term2> into desynchronized emotions. If a character is insulted, they'll have mistake-predominant emotions while we laugh <callback>(emotionally desynchronized).</callback> 
   -->
   
    <p>This is often obvious in comedies. While the <term>characters</term> are perplexed, bickering, complaining, crying, making mistakes, getting hurt, and so on&mdash;the <term2>audience</term2> feels humor:</p>

<p>Often, we alternate between the <term>characters</term> feeling humor and <term2>us</term2> feeling humor:</p>

<p>In a conversation, we're pulled toward synchronization. One of spectator entertainment's distinctive qualities is that we can have some distance from this pull.</p>

<p>If spectator entertainment tried to keep the audience and characters synchronized, it would forfeit one of the distinctive opportunities of spectator entertainment.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
       <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
       <p><term>Sometimes</term> spectator entertainment tries to make the audience feel the same emotion as a character, but this isn't the <term2>general</term2> goal of most spectator entertainment&mdash;and especially not the goal of most comedies.</p>
   </aside>
     </div>


    
    <aside class="box">
        <p><b>Laugh tracks.</b> It was an odd experience to transition from the universal experience of live theaters to radio or television. Suddenly, you were supposed to laugh alone or with a few other people&mdash;in an otherwise empty room! It was an isolating, often unsettling transition.</p>
         
        <p>To ease this transition, showrunners used laugh tracks or live audiences to <sem-weak>simulate</sem-weak> being in an audience. One outcome of this was maintaining the familiar cadence of theater dialogue. <callback>("Line of dialogue" *pause for laughter* "Line of dialogue" *pause for laughter.*)</callback></p>
        
        <p>The laugh track also helped audiences know who to synchronize with. If someone is watching a sitcom and a character comes in and glumly says <callback>"I was fired today"</callback>&mdash;we <sem-weak>could</sem-weak> synchronize toward the character and feel glum. But with a laugh track, we'll synchronize our evaluations with the imaginary "audience" and feel humor.</p>
        
        <p>Over time, TVs were no longer seen as <term>replacing</term> live entertainment&mdash;they just <term2>were</term2> entertainment. People no longer needed a laugh track to feel part of a detached audience from the surreal events depicted. And slowly, laugh tracks began being seen as increasingly archaic or even bizarre&mdash;and an obstacle to new changes to styles and genres.</p>
    </aside>
    
    
    
    <!--
    <p>During this transition, laugh tracks helped viewers learn to emotionally <em>synchronize</em> toward a hypothetical <term>audience</term>, not toward the <term2>characters</term2>. This lets us laugh with the audience, instead of being stressed or bored, like the characters.</p>
    
    <p>Most of this do this intuitively&mdash;if a character in a comedy gets injured and ugly cries, we laugh. And we notice when people don't synchronize to the hypothetical audience&mdash;like when we get frustrated watching a comedy with someone who keeps sympathizing with the characters.</p>
