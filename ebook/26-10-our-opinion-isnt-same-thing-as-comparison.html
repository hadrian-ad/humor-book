<h3 id="26-10">An overall opinion isn't a comparison</h3>


    <p>We sometimes confuse a metric comparison with an overall opinion&mdash;but they're not the same thing.</p>

           <p>This is obvious in many cases. Let's say we're celebrating our birthday with all our favorite people, when someone asks us if we'd be making more money if we were at work than at our party. <callback>("metric comparison")</callback></p>
           
            <p>Whether we say yes or no has no bearing on our overall opinion of our party. Even though metric comparisons of good or bad can sometimes overlap with our overall emotional opinion, they're not the same thing.</p>

      <p>Zoe grew a moderate humor bush with the <book-title>Tennis for Beginners</book-title> event. That means her overall opinion was mostly good. <callback>("Kind of fun.")</callback> Since she enjoyed being outside, meeting new people and trying new things, she overall felt:</p>

    <p>Ostensibly, she was there to learn about tennis. But overall, despite not learning much about tennis, she felt enough humor here and there to have a good overall opinion of the experience.</p>

    <p>Emma could have asked Zoe endless numbers of comparative questions. These might be metric comparisons of price, effort, outcome, and so on. But these <term>comparisons</term> are <em>different</em> than our <term2>overall</term2> opinion of something.</p> 
    
    <p>Our opinion is how we emotionally experience something&mdash;not how we set up comparisons before or after the fact. That's because our broadest emotional relation to something is our humor bush.</p>

           <consider>Consider:</consider>
            <p>Metric comparisons and overall opinions can overlap. If Zoe was <sem-weak>desperately</sem-weak> hoping to learn about tennis, it might have been a large mistake and a small OK to realize it wasn't a cost- or time-effective way to learn tennis. This may have prevented most of her humor, and she would have had a negative overall opinion.</p> 
             
             <p>In this case, one metric assessment <callback>("efficiency of learning")</callback> would overlap with her overall opinion <callback>("bad")</callback>. But even though this metric assessment would overlap with her overall opinion in this case, that doesn't make them the same thing.</p>

             <p>There's nothing odd about having <term>good</term> overall opinion of something we also can make bad metric comparisons of, just like there's nothing odd about having a <term2>bad</term2> overall opinion of something we can also make good metric comparisons  of it.</p>  
             
             <p>For instance, just because something is cheap <callback>("cheap compared to similar things")</callback> doesn't mean we'll have a good overall opinion of things.

         <p>Zoe may have learned a lot about tennis <callback>("good")</callback> but also felt angry, lonely, unappreciated, uncomfortable, unwelcome, and so on <callback>("bad")</callback>.
