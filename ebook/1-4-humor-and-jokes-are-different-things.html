  This book focuses on humor, not jokes
</h2>
  
<p>
	Instead of talking about <term>
	    <emotions>humor</emotions>
	</term> <callback>(emotions)</callback>, we sometimes instead drift into talking about <term2>humor</term2> <callback>(genres)</callback>&mdash;like "farces," "jokes," "irony," and so on. The problem with this is that we don't always laugh or smile at these things!</p>
		
	<p>Like anything else, comedies, farces, jokes, irony, and so on <em>can</em> lead to <emotions>humor</emotions>&mdash;but they don’t always.
</p>

	Since jokes, comedies, wittiness, satire, and so on can lead to <sem-weak>any</sem-weak> emotion outcome, they're not the same thing as <emotions>humor</emotions>:

	Since we’re focusing on <term>humor</term> in this book, we <outcome-contrast>won’t</outcome-contrast> be focusing on <term2>jokes</term2> or <term2>satire</term2>&mdash;since those things aren’t <emotions>humor</emotions>.</p> 
   
   <p>Instead, we'll stay focused on <term>when</term> and <term2>why</term2> the emotion of humor happens.</p>

   <div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
         <consider>Consider:</consider> 
            <p>Thinking a <term>joke</term> will explain <term>laughing</term> is a bit like thinking a <term2>salad</term2> will explain <term2>eating</term2>.</p> 
                    
                    <p>Why can't a salad explain eating? For one, we can have a salad and not eat it&mdash;since a salad isn't the same thing as eating.</p>
                    
                    <p>For another, if our goal is to explain "eating," we can distort or narrow our explanation if we focus on "eating a salad" instead of "eating" more generally.</p>
    </aside>  </div>


 <aside class="box">
     <p><headline>Jokes and everything.</headline> We sometimes call everything we laugh at a joke:  <callback>"We sometimes laugh at jokes. Therefore <em>everything</em> we laugh at is some kind of joke."</callback></p> 
     
        
     <p>It's easy to see this as idiomatic by creating new idioms. If we started saying: <callback>"we sometimes buy coffee. Therefore, <em>everything</em> we buy is some kind of coffee”</callback>&mdash;we would never take this expression too literally!</p>
        
     <p>It's strange to frame all <term>buying</term> around <term>coffee</term> for the same reasons  it's strange to frame all <term2>laughing</term2> around <term2>jokes</term2>.</p>
