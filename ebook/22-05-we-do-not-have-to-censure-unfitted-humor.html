    <h3 id="22-05">We don't have to censure unfitted humor</h3>

  
<p>When humor or a humor attempt is below dress code, we don't <term>have</term> to censure it. Instead, it just means we have the <term2>option</term2> to.</p>  

<p>Often, there's no reason to censure humor or humor attempts:</p>

         <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“What if we…”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“…shit all over the classroom?”</speech> *laughs harder* <notes>(&larr;unfitted humor)</notes></p>

<p>Owen can make an accurate emotional forecast of how <term>Zoe</term> will react when he flicks things at her. This lets him confidently make this unfitted humor attempt with her.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>By contrast, Owen couldn't forecast how a <term2>stranger</term2> would react if he flicked things at them&mdash;which is why Owen is more likely to have unfitted humor with a friend like Zoe than with a stranger.</p>

<p>No one above had any reason to censure humor&mdash;so no one did.</p>

        <p>If we imagine we're the only onse in a situation with a high dress code, we're the only ones who can bring censure&mdash;so if we don't, there's no censure.</p>

<p>When something is below dress code, that doesn't mean we <term>will</term> or <term>should</term> censure it&mdash;it just means that <term2>if</term2> we censure it, others will find that censure justified:</p>

<p>Above, Sam doesn’t bother to censure an unfitted humor attempt himself. But <em>if</em> someone censures it, Sam will see their censure as justified.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider">
         <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>That doesn’t mean Sam would approve of censure of <em>any</em> strength. Instead, Sam would see censure as justified in proportion to how unfitted it was.</p>

        <p>Since Jasper’s humor attempt wasn’t particularly unfitted, Sam would see a good-natured <term>groan</term> as a <term>justified</term> intensity of censure&mdash;but would see <term2>yelling</term2> at the stage as an <term2>unjustified</term2> intensity of censure.

     <p><headline>Normalcy.</headline> Desynchronization and resynchronization is a normal part of being around others. Censure and dress codes are just how we group and collaborate:</p>

     </div> 
     
     <p>Above, Zoe’s censure <callback>(exaggerated grimace)</callback> wasn’t received by Emma as harsh&mdash;it was just part of a collaborative, back-and-forth process that allowed evaluations to be shared and reacted to. This allowed a group to reach a consensus in just a few seconds.</p>
     
     <p>Censure is just a normal part of how conversations and groups work. Like trying to balance a scale, it's usually neither annoying nor notable&mdash;just how a task is done. It's only only occasionally that the same mechanism becomes large enough to become confrontational.</p>
