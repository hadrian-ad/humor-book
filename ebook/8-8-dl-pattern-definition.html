<p>One way we define things is through <vocab>pattern definitions</vocab>.</p>

 <p>Pattern definitions are much closer to how we actually define things than dictionary definitions&mdash;pattern definitions are why we can drive past ten barns and recognize them each as a “barn,” even though none of them look exactly alike.</p> 

<p>To see how pattern definitions works, we can make a simple pattern definition for a barn. We’ll start by making a list of things we understand to be possible elements of barns:</p> 

<div class="list-in-text">
<p><strong>Elements of our pattern definition:</strong></p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
   <li>silo</li>
    <li>big double doors</li>
    <li>stand alone structure</li>
    <li>red</li>
    <li>winch</li>
    <li>fodder</li>
    <li>made of wood</li>
    <li>gambrel roof</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
</div>

<p>Then, we assign weight to each element of a barn, since some things are more important to what a barn “is” than others. So we'll assign points for “barnness:”</p>

<div class="list-in-text">
<p><strong>Elements of our pattern definition:</strong></p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
    <li>
        silo (10) <notes>(&larr;ten points toward “barnness”)</notes>
    </li>
    <li>big double doors (5)</li>
    <li>stand alone structure (3)</li>
    <li>red (2)</li>
    <li>winch (5)</li>
    <li>fodder (3)</li>
    <li>made of wood (2)</li>
    <li>gambrel roof (5)</li>
</ul>
 <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
</div>

<p>The final piece of a pattern definition is to set a point threshold for what we identify as a barn. Let’s say 15 points is the threshold where we tag a structure as being a barn. Now, if we come across three very different buildings, we’ll be able to classify each one as barn or not-barn: </p> 

<div class="list-in-text"><p><strong>Structure #1</strong></p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
   <li>silo (10)</li>
    <li>winch (5)</li>
    </ul>

<p style="margin-left: 4rem; font-size: medium">= 15 points of barnness = “it’s a barn!”</p> </div>

<div class="list-in-text"><p><strong>Structure #2</strong></p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
   <li>stand alone structure (3)</li>
    <li>red (2)</li>
    <li>big double doors (5)</li>
    <li>fodder (2)</li>
    <li>made of wood (3)</li>
    </ul>

<p style="margin-left: 4rem; font-size: medium">= 15 points of barnness = “it’s a barn!”</p> </div>         

<div class="list-in-text">
<p><strong>Structure #3</strong></p>

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
   <li>stand alone structure (3)</li>
    
    <li>made of wood (3)</li>
    
    <li>gambrel roof (5)</li>
    </ul>

<p style="margin-left: 4rem; font-size: medium">= 11 points of barnness = “well it’s barn-<i>like…</i>”</p>
</div>

<p>When we combine dozens of pattern definitions for different structures, we have a flexible system for identification and classification. We’ll have patterns in our head for barns, houses, monasteries, outhouses, sheds, warehouses, and so on&mdash;which we can mix and match to describe even buildings that are unique in all the world. <callback>(“Well, it looks like a mix between a barn and a… monastery?”)</callback></p>

<p>There’s no official cosmic pattern definition for something like a barn. They’re just definitions we make up ourselves, out of everything we know about them. This means these pattern definitions vary person-by-person, based on our experiences.</p>

<div class="consider">
<aside class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>Someone who grew up in 21st century Japan would have a different pattern definition for “barn” than someone who grew up in 14th century France.</p> 
    
    <p>Similarly, someone who lived in a city would have a different pattern definition for barn someone who uses or researches barns.</p>
</aside>
</div>

<p>The pattern definition we made above is just based on the barns we see in children’s books and stock photos&mdash;it's probably not a very good pattern definition for most practical purposes. As we gain more awareness about barns, we’d update and refine our definition.</p> 

<p>In this chapter, we’ve been making a pattern definition of <em>humor</em>:</p>

 <p><strong>Elements of our pattern definition:</strong></p>

<div class="list-in-text"><ul class="close-list" style="list-style: none">
   <li>laughter (10)</li>
    
    <li>smiling (5)</li>
    
    <li>brightening (3)</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
</div>
<p>We have a set of possible reaction elements, and we can decide which of these reaction elements are part of the humor pattern and which are part of other emotional patterns. This lets us take an emotional state that’s unique in all the world and try to make sense of whether it has what we’ve patterned as “humor” in it.</p>

<p>This is why we can see a thousand people feel humor a thousand times each, and still recognize it all as humor&mdash;even though none of those million moments of humor are exactly alike. It’s for the same reason we can recognize a thousand different structures as barns, even if none of them are exactly alike!</p>

<p>We can use pattern definitions to think about what emotions are. We take the set of possible human reaction elements <callback>(“emotion tells”)</callback>, and see which ones co-occur in relationships. We give names to these patterns, like <emotions>sadness</emotions> or <emotions>anger</emotions>. But it’s important to notice that there isn’t an "official" definition to an emotion like <emotions>anger</emotions>, since there are so many ways to tweak our pattern definition of it.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
<aside class="consider">
    <consider>For instance:</consider>
    
    <p>Maybe the convention fifty years ago was that anger required 25 points to be “anger”&mdash;but today the word anger only requires 15 points. Maybe a hundred years ago, blasphemous cursing was 15 points toward anger, but today is usually only 5 points toward anger.</p>
    
    <p>Maybe one language has a very broad pattern for <emotions>anger</emotions> but another language splits this pattern up into two emotions. Maybe another language doesn't have a word for <emotions>anger</emotions> and uses a word like <emotions>hurt</emotions> instead.</p>
</aside>
</div> 


<p>We're using a specific pattern definition for humor in this book that's broader than is conventional. While many conventional pattern definitions of humor focus on high-intensity humor, like belly laughing&mdash;we want our pattern definition to include low-intensities of humor too. <callback>("A single exhale making up a very soft laugh.")</callback></p>

<p>We can also use pattern definitions to think about why humor family words are humor&mdash;even though we can somewhat distinguish between experiences of <emotions>achievement</emotions> and <emotions>generosity</emotions>.</p> 

<ul class="close-list" style="list-style-type: none">
<li>
    First, humor family words are like nested patterns <sem-weak>within</sem-weak> the pattern of humor&mdash;similar to how <emotions>irritability</emotions> and <emotions>frustration</emotions> are specific patterns within a broader pattern of <emotions>anger</emotions>.
</li>

<li>
    Second, a pattern definition for the word <term>humor</term> tends to <term>exclude</term> context&mdash;while <term2>humor family words</term2> explicitly <term2>include</term2> context as part of their pattern definition.
</li>
</ul>



<p>As we’ll see throughout this book, the pattern definition of humor we're using will let us talk about ourselves and the world in some interesting ways&mdash;and let us think pragmatically about some of the underlying systems that make up our experiences.</p>
   
    </div>
       
                <div class="chapter-end"><p>That's it for this chapter!</p> 
    </div>

       <div class="chapter-summary">
        
      <h4 class="chapter-summary" id="chapter-8-summary">Chapter summary</h4>
    
    <p>
    When clusters of humor tells co-occur, we label it as humor. The word "humor" is a pattern definition made up of <vocab>humor tells</vocab>.
    </p> 
    
    <ul>
       <li>We'll use a <a href="8-0-humor-tells.html#exclude-navigation">specific list</a> of humor tells in this book: <humor-tell>active eyes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>flushing, higher speaking register</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reduction of physical tension</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxed posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>efforts to spread humor</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>fast thinking</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>fast speaking</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>louder voice</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>optimism, raised spirits</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reduction of stress</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>.</li>
        
        <li><i>Humor tells = humor = humor family words.</i> These are all different ways of looking at the same thing. This is why humor tells individually carry humor qualities like <a href="8-3-humor-tell-change-over-time-to-express-change-in-intensity.html#exclude-navigation">intensity and duration</a>, like how a smile has degrees of intensity or duration.</li>
            
        <li>Humor tells combine with other emotion tells to make up our <a href="8-5-humor-tells-are-expressed-in-many-different-ways.html#exclude-navigation">emotional state</a>. For instance, "humor tells" and "anger tells" together mean we have humor and anger simultaneously in our emotional state.</li>
