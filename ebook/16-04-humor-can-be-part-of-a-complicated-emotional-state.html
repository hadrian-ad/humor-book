Humor outcomes don't always describe the entire emotional state
</h3>


<p>Since humor can be a part of a mixed emotional state, we often feel humor at the <em>same time</em> we feel a mistake-predominant emotion&mdash;like shame:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Minh spends fifteen minutes explaining to Amaya how the mobile game <book-title>Fired Fireman: First-Person Hooter</book-title> had abandoned the things that made the franchise great.</narration></p>
        
          <p><narration>He talks and talks and talks and Amaya gets more and more bored.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <action>*interrupting*</action> <speech>“Minh&mdash;you’re being just like that fan boy character in <book-title>Fired Fireman 2</book-title>!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <internalaction>(aghast)</internalaction> <speech>“Squire Dorkulous Knows-a-Lot?”</speech> <internalaction>(ruefully)</internalaction> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Ouch!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh experiences both <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes> and <emotions-in-notes>shame</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>     
    </div>

<p>Minh reaches humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>being given new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>being acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>an argument being supported</humor-outcome>, and so on&mdash;he feels humor. At the same time, the unflattering comparison <em>also</em> makes him feel mistake-predominant emotions:</p>

<p>In this case, we can still describe Minh’s humor in terms of <term>good</term> outcomes&mdash;but that doesn’t mean his humor can’t <term2>coexist</term2> with other things we’d describe as less straightforwardly positive, like shame.</p> 

<p>Other times, we might first feel humor, only for the humor to evaporate quickly, leaving us with just negative outcomes:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
 <blockquote>
           <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*leaving*</action> <speech>“See ya!”</speech> <internalaction>(mocking imitation)</internalaction> <speech>“I’m off to the big city to be an <sem-weak>ah</sem-weak>ctress.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
        
        <p><strong>A.</strong> <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feels Elias <humor-outcome>symbolized close ties</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>created rapport</humor-outcome>)</notes> <speech>“I do not sound like that!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><strong>B.</strong> <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*closes door*</action> <action>*feels sad*</action> <notes>(&larr;<emotions-in-notes>sadness</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feel Elias <humor-outcome>symbolized <outcome-contrast>weak</outcome-contrast> ties</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>created <outcome-contrast>division</outcome-contrast></humor-outcome>)</notes></p>

<p>Even though humor outcomes are describable as positive for those who <term>feel</term> humor, that’s different than saying the <term2>overall</term2> consequences of humor are always positive or remain positive&mdash;or that people can’t generate humor as part of a wider intention to cause harm.</p>
