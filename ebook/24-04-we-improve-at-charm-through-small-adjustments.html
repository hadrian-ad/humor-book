<p>Below, small changes make a big difference to a charm attempt:</p>

    alt="This iumage compares two integration figures, one for 'no prelude' and one for 'prelude' The 'no prelude' figure has less lines stretching to relevant topics, humor family words, and humor outcomes than the figure with the prelude, which is on topics of drama, drama team, team talent, makes them feel achievement, delight, revelation, success, and does things like support an argument and give new perspective."

<p>Sam improved his charm attempt by making small adjustments toward efficiency, cohesion, relevance, humor family words, humor outcomes, and so on.</p> 
         
  <p>If we want to become more charming, we don't have to change our entire personality <callback>("I must get from gruff to bubbly")</callback>. Instead, we have to improve our overall ability to observe emotional situations&mdash;and then to consistently make small adjustments accordingly.</p>

       <consider>Consider:</consider>
      <p>We may know someone who is both gregarious and charming. We may then link them: to be good at charm, we <em>have</em> to be gregarious&mdash;or at least <sem-weak>pretend</sem-weak> to be. But this often confuses a means <callback>(gregariousness)</callback> with the ends <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>.</p>
                   
  <p>It’s obvious that being gregarious isn’t the same thing as being charming&mdash;since we also know gregarious people who are annoying, not charming!  The gregariousness is neither here nor there: what matters is whether or not they generate fitted humor.</p>

<p>We described charm as an outcome, not a method&mdash;with there being <em>many</em> paths to the same outcome. This is why we know charming people who are any combination of: 
</p>
<ul class="close-list">                   
                        <li>awkward</li>
                        <li>direct</li>
                        <li>brusque</li>
                        <li>careful</li>

                        <li>forward</li>
                        <li>generous</li>
<li>gruff</li>
                        <li>impulsive </li>
<li>kind</li>
    <li>loud</li>
        <li>premeditative</li>
            <li>quiet</li>
                <li>sincere</li>
                    <li>shy</li>
                         <li>thoughtful</li>
                         </ul>
                          
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>                     
<p>Within these small styles, we can make small changes that consistently help us generate or reach fitted humor more often. It's a matter of these small changes more so than an impossible large change.</p>
           
<aside class="box">
    <p><b>Comparisons.</b> If we have a charming friend, it can be exhausting to imagine trying to be charming like they are. But we <term>don't</term> have to try to be charming like they are&mdash;since there are <term2>many</term2> ways to be charming.</p>
    
    <p>When a thousand people become better at fitted humor, they’re not all converging toward the same style of being charming. Instead, they’d each be refining their own style in a way that feels very comfortable to each of them.</p>
    
    
    <p>We already know this feeling. When we’re in an unusually good mood, we’re better at generating fitted humor in ourselves or others. This experience usually feels <term>less</term> like becoming more like someone <term>else</term>, and <term2>more</term2> like <term2>ourselves</term2>&mdash;and feels good, not stressful.</p>
