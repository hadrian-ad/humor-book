<p>It can take work to reach humor outcomes&mdash;which we means don't have to give up pushing toward a humor outcome if we don't reach it right away.</p> 

<p>We know this with polite refusals&mdash;if someone politely declines our offer of something to drink, we know that in some situations we push a little more:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><narration>Yasmin goes to the bathroom, leaving Trevor sitting awkwardly at the table with her mother and siblings.</narration></p>
        
        <p><narration>There’s an awkward pause. Then Yasmin’s mother gets up.</narration></p>

<p>While this is familiar for <term>polite</term> refusal, it's the exact same thing for <term2>impolite</term2> refusals too:</p>

    alt="While the last figure showed an polite refusal of Trevor declining a trink, this figure shows an impolite refusal of Xiaowei trying to shut down a conversation. The momentum bounces a bit before Heather gets the situation across the humor outcome tripwire."

<p>The difference between the polite and impolite refusals is smaller than it seems at first. Their initial response <callback>(polite refusal, impolite refusal)</callback> are both part of positional movement within an evaluatory situation. One person is pushing the situation toward a humor outcome&mdash;another is trying to deflect from that outcome.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>This partnered motion within a situation is how <em>all</em> humor happens, everywhere&mdash;not just for <humor-outcome>opening a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, but for <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>, and so on too.</p>
        
            <p>More often than not, humor outcomes are reached after a give-and-take and push-and-pull&mdash;something that often involves resistance and tension before emotional outcomes are reached.</p>
    </aside>
    </div>
 
<aside class="box">
    
     
    <p><b>Declining.</b> The offer of something to drink is just a means to Yasmin's mother's ultimate goal&mdash;which is for Trevor to feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Knowing this is the ultimate goal, Trevor can effectively decline the drink. He'll have to pair his <callback>"no thanks"</callback> with humor tells. When Yasmin’s mother sees that he <humor-outcome>feels accepted</humor-outcome>&mdash;feels <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mdash;she'll be satisfied, whether or not he takes the drink. <callback>(Effective refusal)</callback></p> 
      
       
    <p>Otherwise, if Trevor just tries to explain why he doesn't want a drink <callback>("I'm not thirsty")</callback>,  Yasmin's mother will continue offering other things to try to reach her goal of making Trevor feel <emotions>welcome</emotions>&mdash;and will be unsettled if he never allows her to reach that goal. </p>  
     
      
     <div class="consider">
         <aside class="consider">
             <consider>Consider:</consider>
                 <p>It's the same whether we're declining or <em>accepting</em> an offer. It's not enough for Trevor to simply <term>take</term> the drink without smiling&mdash;for the same reason he can't simply <term2>refuse</term2> the drink without smiling.</p>
                 
                <p>When their goal is helping us reach a humor outcome, we have to express humor tells&mdash;whether accepting or declining.   Otherwise, they see us as feeling <emotions>alienated</emotions>, <emotions>uncomfortable</emotions>, <emotions>unwelcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>
