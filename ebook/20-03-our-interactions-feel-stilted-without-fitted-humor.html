    <h3 id="20-03">We prefer fitted humor</h3>
    
   
<p>When Sam <em>doesn’t</em> set up or follow-up on hooks, his speech will feel clunky and unfitted:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Lina shushes everyone. The principle is about to come in! The drama team quiets as Sam enters the classroom.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <speech>“Whoa! What happened to the colors in this room?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Who approved this? Hope it wasn’t me.”</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor attempt isn’t based on any hook to make audience feel humor family words)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><speech>“Anyway, I’m stopping by because you all scored pretty well at regionals. Sorry you guys were so upset about that mix-up earlier, but we have a lot more important things on our plate.”</speech> <action>*audience is quiet*</action> <speech>“I had the privilege of going to a conference in Philly, big hoopla, and I…”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“…realized I don’t do well on more than five cups of coffee, hoo boy…”</speech> <action>*crowd chuckles politely*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor attempt was on hook for himself, not on the audience)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><speech>“Anyway, I realized that you competed with less people than other schools, which was news to me.

<p>Sam's audience found his speech distasteful, inelegant, ineffective, toned-deaf, and so on&mdash;in part because of the absence of fitted humor and fitted humor attempts. Sam comes across hooks for humor family words, but doesn’t follow them.</p> 

<p>Sam still expresses humor tells <sem-weak>himself</sem-weak> and makes humor <sem-weak>attempts</sem-weak> <callback>(“I don’t do well on more than five cups of coffee…”)</callback>&mdash;but without <em>fitted</em> humor attempts, this speech comes off as worse than the other.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>As we saw last chapter, sometimes there's an unfitted <term>presence</term> of humor attempts, like when Sam talks about the paint color of the room&mdash;but other times there's an unfitted <term2>absence</term2> of humor attempts, like when Sam doesn’t properly congratulate the team.</p> 
    </div>

<p>Sam’s speech had greater impact on his audience when he created and followed hooks&mdash;and made humor attempts that fit the situation.</p>
