    <h3 id="23-07">Charm can be sharp</h3>   
    
   
  
<p>The word “charm” can sometimes make us think of things that are anodyne, artificial, bland, insincere, saccharine, soft, or so on.</p> 

<p>But charm attempts occur in all kinds of ways&mdash;many of which don’t strike us as saccharine or soft:</p> 


<div class="vignette">
    <blockquote>
        <p><speaker>Tutor:</speaker> <action>*finishes reading Zoe’s grad school application essay*</action> <action>*sighs*</action> <speech>“This is pretty terrible.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;tutor prioritizes fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;charm attempt)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*cathartic laugh*</action> “Really? Oh no.” <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
    </blockquote>
</div>



<p>At first, the tutor seems abrasive or rude&mdash;but the tutor was making a charm attempt by prioritizing efficiency and cohesion. Since Zoe felt fitted humor, it was a <sem-weak>successful</sem-weak> charm attempt:</p>

    alt="This image visually calls back to the integration figure linking moment A to moment B. A small circle in the middle represents the tutor's comment 'this is pretty terrible,' with integration lines going both left and right of it. On the left, it says 'tutor wants too...' followed by humor outcomes like '...acceptably criticize Zoe, control the situation, open a new topic of conversation, reduce Zoe's defensiveness, support their arugments.' On the right, it says 'Zoe feels...' followed by humor outcomes like '...accetably criticized, the situation is being controlled, the argument is being supported, a new topic of conversation is being opened, catharsis, her tensions are eased, she's surviing a high stress situation.'"

<p>On the surface, the content and tone of charm attempts can seem aggressive, direct, blunt, teasing, and so on. It’s not always until we check intentions and outcomes that we notice something as a charm attempt:</p>

<p>In this book, charm doesn’t mean <callback>“bland kindness with all sharp edges rubbed off.”</callback> It just means someone is giving more weight to fittedness than intensity. This can be done softly or sharply.</p>
