Humor isn't itself a negative experience 
</h1>


<p>Sometimes we think that humor outcomes can be negative&mdash;since humor can be present during moments of belittling, dehumanizing, and so on.</p>

<p>But if people are feeling <term>shame</term>, they're feeling <term>shame</term>—<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> humor. People who are feeling <em>belittled</em> are feeling <em>belittled</em>&mdash;<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> humor:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor comes into class and slips and falls, his cereal cup falling down his shirt. The entire class is at first shocked, but when they see he’s not hurt, start laughing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;class feels humor)</notes> </p>
    
    <p><narration>Bitter and unamused, Trevor stalks away to the bathroom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels shame)</notes></p> 
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma sees Owen selling candy in the hallway.</narration> <speech>“You’re selling candy?”</speech> <narration>Emma says. She laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels humor)</notes> “What are you, a girl scout?”</p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen’s face burns.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen feels shame, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes></p>
    
    </div>
    
<div class="vignette">    
        <p><narration>Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table and they look at him and laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Emma feel humor)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speech>“Nice hat, man!”</speech> <narration>Emma says, admiringly. Owen is horrified. They had laughed.</narration> <speech>“Thanks,”</speech> <narration>he says, tingling with horror.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen feels shame, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes></p>
        
        </div> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Middle school Emma is talking to Heather, her favorite teacher, when a passing student makes a witty comment about Emma’s buzzed head. Heather laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Heather feels humor)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Emma feels weirdly crushed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels shame, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>When Heather laughs at the comment about Emma’s hair, Heather <humor-outcome>eased tension (with herself)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoided conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport (with the mocking student)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>thought the student revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on. Heather feels humor.</p> 

<p>But while <term>Heather</term> feels humor, <em>Emma</em> <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> feel humor—and so <em>Emma</em> <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> experience any humor outcomes. Instead, since Emma felt mistake-predominant emotions, she felt mistake-predominant outcomes:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>instead of <humor-outcome>reduced defensiveness</humor-outcome>, Emma felt <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>increased</outcome-contrast> defensiveness</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>instead of being <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, Emma felt she was <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized</humor-outcome></li>
    <li>instead of <humor-outcome>negative emotions turned into positive ones</humor-outcome>, Emma felt <humor-outcome>negative emotions <outcome-contrast>stay</outcome-contrast> negative</humor-outcome></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>Even though <term>Heather's</term> humor has bad outcomes for <term>Emma</term>—we can still describe <em>Heather's</em> humor in terms of “good” emotional outcomes for <em>Heather</em>.</p> 

<p>In this way, humor can be described positively for whoever is <sem-weak>feeling</sem-weak> humor&mdash;even at the same time the situation can be described negatively overall.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Humor isn't a negative emotion even in more severe situations&mdash;like if a group of kids circle around another kid and laugh as they push and mock them.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">The <term>harassers</term> are feeling humor, which can be described as positive humor outcomes for the <term>harassers</term>. But the <em>target</em> or <em>observers</em> of the harassment aren’t <em>themselves</em> feeling humor.

    </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Tracking.</headline> Since emotions are part of how we communicate, we need to be precise in tracking who is feeling what. We already do this for who is <term>saying</term> what&mdash;and we should be <sem>as</sem> careful when it comes to who is <em>feeling</em> what.</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes, we aren’t precise in tracking humor, and can even be careless about it—like saying <callback>“everyone laughed”</callback> in a group, even though some people weren’t feeling humor.</p>
    
    <p>We wouldn’t do this for speech! If most people said yes, and a few said no, it would be weird to say <sem>everyone</sem> said yes—or to mix-up who said yes with who said no.</p> 
    
    <p>Even though we almost never do this with speech, we sometimes do this with emotions. This is often avoidable carelessness—since we're capable of applying the same care to emotions that we already do for speech.</p>
