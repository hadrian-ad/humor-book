Humor outcomes help us characterize humor
</h1>  

<p>Sometimes, it's hard to "match" something to a humor outcome:</p>
    
   <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>
    </div>

    title="";
    style="max-width: 33rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >

<p>To use humor outcomes here, we have to see humor outcomes as <sem>linking</sem> <term>someone</term> to <em>something</em>.</p> 
   
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>   
             <p class="for-instance-text">A title like <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title> doesn't <humor-outcome>create rapport (generally)</humor-outcome>&mdash;instead, <sem>someone</sem> feels <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title> <humor-outcome>creates rapport (<outcome-contrast>with something or someone specific</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>.</p> </div>
   
   <p>This lets us use humor outcomes even with things that at first seem nonsensical or unrelated to humor outcomes:</p>
    

         
           <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-06-specific-topics/14-06-3-ferdydurke-complete.sketchpad.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >
     
<p>We can do this for other book titles:</p>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Cryptonomicon</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Handy Andy</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>
    </div>

  <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler</book-title>. She smiles at the title.</narration> <notes>(&larr;it feels hard to match Zoe's humor to a humor outcome)</notes></p>
    </div>

<p>In all of these titles, Zoe's humor doesn't seem to intuitively match with any humor outcomes. We can use humor outcomes by being more attentive to what humor outcomes are linking:</p> 
               
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>
           instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>created rapport (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>created rapport (<outcome-contrast>with her</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
       </li>
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>controlled the situation (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>controlled a situation (by <outcome-contrast>influencing how she spent her attention</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
        </li>
        <li>
          instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>supported arguments (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>supported an argument (<outcome-contrast>about what the book will be like</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
            </li>
        <li>
            instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>gave her new perspectives (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt a title <humor-outcome>gave her new perspective (<outcome-contrast>about how books can be titled</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>
        </li> 
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized (everything)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) acceptably criticized (<outcome-contrast>the title</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome> or that <sem>Zoe</sem> felt that <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>the title</outcome-contrast>) acceptably criticized (<outcome-contrast>other titles</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>eased tensions (generally)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) eased tension (<outcome-contrast>with herself after encountering something weird</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        <li>
        instead of saying a title <humor-outcome>handled complaints (about itself)</humor-outcome>, we'd say <strong>Zoe</strong> felt <humor-outcome>(<outcome-contrast>she</outcome-contrast>) handled (<outcome-contrast>her own</outcome-contrast>) complaint (<outcome-contrast>about the title</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome></li>
        
        </ul>    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
   
    <p>This lets us unpack Zoe's perspective and humor in more specific ways, which help describe <sem-weak>why</sem-weak> someone felt humor.</p>  
  

<div class="consider">
     <p class="consider">Consider: </p>

         <p class="considertext">In each case, we can use humor outcomes like "evaluatory verbs," which describe actions, changes, or outcomes in someone's evaluatory state leading to humor.</p> </div>

    <p><headline>Explaining.</headline> If we laugh at a book title, we sometimes want to explain our laugh by calling the title a joke or satirical. <callback>("We laughed because the title was a joke.")</callback> But this isn’t usually the best way to go about explaining our humor.</p>  
    
    <p>For one, there are <sem-weak>many</sem-weak> possible ways of describing a title like <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title> or <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are</book-title>&mdash;"joke" being just one of many possible descriptions. For another, we don't <sem>always</sem> laugh at jokes&mdash;so calling something a joke doesn't yet <sem-weak>explain</sem-weak> why we did or didn't laugh when we saw it.</p>
        
    <p>But while Zoe doesn't always feel humor at every joke every time, Zoe <sem>does</sem> always feels humor when she <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome>&mdash;otherwise, she wouldn’t have <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>. This is why explaining Zoe's new perspective directly explains her humor.</p> 
    
    <!--
    <p>We can see the same thing with Justin and Heather.</p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Justin and Heather go biking through the cemetery every weekend. They often stop to ponder and enjoy a chipper sign that says</narration> <speech>“Cremation? Do we have a place FOR YOU!”</speech></p>

    <p>Above, Justin wants to describe something with genre words&mdash;all of which sometimes generate humor, and sometimes don't. But it's not "tone deaf" that makes Heather laugh&mdash;the actual evaluatory action happening is <humor-outcome>rapport being created</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>taboo topics being dealt with</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new topics of conversation being opened</humor-outcome>, and so on. This directly explains the humor, instead of just describing an object.</p>

 <p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain a family's humor. They didn't expect to see a sign like this <callback>(a mistake)</callback>, and it didn't have personal consequences for them <callback>(it's OK)</callback>.</p>
 
 <p>This would be a pretty shallow place to stop. So to dig deeper, we can use our list of humor outcomes. How would some humor outcomes apply, even in poetic or non-standard ways?</p>
 
 <p>By using humor outcomes, we can ask specific questions, like: in what way is their humor showing that something was <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>tensions were eased</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>new perspectives were found</humor-outcome>, that a <humor-outcome>personality trait was revealed</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>close ties were symbolized?</humor-outcome></p>
 
<p>By answering these questions, we can spark personal insight into some of the actions happening in the emotional situation.</p>

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain why Zoe and Emma felt humor. <callback>("The poster deviated from Zoe's expectations, and she felt equally secure from negative personal consequences.")</callback></p>

<p>At the same time, this generic language can obscure aspects of the emotional situation that we intuitively feel is happening. To cast a net for these aspects, we can use humor outcomes.</p>

<p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma's humor <humor-outcome>created rapport (among themselves, with the sign, with the establishment, and so on)</humor-outcome>; <humor-outcome>gave a new perspective (by inverting a meanginful idiom)</humor-outcome>; the sign's design, location, mood, sentiment, tone, vibe, and so on <humor-outcome>reveals a personal view (of the artist, establishment, or viewer)</humor-outcome>; and so on.</p>

    <p>We don't need to describe the genre or tone of Obama's statement <callback>("was it a joke? Satire? Mocking? Teasing? Biting? Clever?")</callback> to think about why the audience laughed.</p> 
    
    <p>Instead, we can simply say the audience laughed because they felt Obama <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave new perspective</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieved catharsis</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This lets us understand the relation between the statement and the audience in a way that explains humor&mdash;without getting bogged down in trying to categorize speech.</p> 
    
<p>Obama went on in a way that some people thought was mean-spirited:</p> 

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-IW6PwJYcOc?si=clNGfdAfVlSU1UuO&amp;start=335&amp;end=350" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Obama:</speaker> <internalaction>(derisively)</internalaction> <speech>"We have these things called aircraft carriers where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." <internalaction>(regaining composure)</internalaction>  "And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities."</speech></p></div>
    
<p>Let's say someone thought this was mean, not funny. What was different here than moments before?</p>

<p>Again, we can use humor outcomes. Someone who thought Obama went too far thought he didn't <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized</humor-outcome>, didn't <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>undermined</outcome-contrast> an argument</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
  
<p>As before, <sem>how</sem> we describe the comment doesn't matter <callback>(mocking, arguing, teasing, angry, joking, and so on)</callback> since those words are outcome nonspecific&mdash;they don't by themselves indicate who would or wouldn't laugh in a given situation. So we can instead start by simply saying that some viewers didn't feel they reached any humor outcomes&mdash;and so they didn't feel humor.</p>
