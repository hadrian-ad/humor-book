Humor can be part of a complicated emotional state 
</h1>


<p>Since humor can be a part of a mixed emotional state, we often feel humor at the same time we feel a mistake-predominant emotion&mdash;like shame:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Minh spends fifteen minutes explaining to Amaya how the mobile game <book-title>Fired Fireman: First-Person Hooter</book-title> had abandoned the things that made the franchise great. He talks and talks and talks and Amaya gets more and more bored.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <speech>“Minh—you’re being just like that fan boy character in <book-title>Fired Fireman 2</book-title>!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <internalaction>(aghast)</internalaction> <speech>“Squire Dorkulous Knows-a-Lot?”</speech> <internalaction>(ruefully)</internalaction> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Ouch!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh experiences both humor and shame)</notes></p>     
    </div>

<p>Minh reaches humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>being given new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>being acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>an argument being supported</humor-outcome>, and so on—he feels humor. At the same time, the unflattering comparison <sem>also</sem> makes him feel mistake-predominant emotions:</p>

<p>In this case, we can still describe Minh’s humor in terms of <term>good</term> outcomes—but that doesn’t mean his humor can’t <em>coexist</em> with other things we’d describe as less straightforwardly positive, like shame.</p> 

<p>Other times, we might first feel humor, only for the humor to evaporate quickly, leaving us with just negative outcomes:</p>

    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*leaving*</action> <speech>“See ya!”</speech> <internalaction>(mocking imitation)</internalaction> <speech>“I’m off to the big city to be an ahctress.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    
    <p><strong>A.</strong> <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feels Elias symbolized close ties and created rapport)</notes> <speech>“I do not sound like that!”</speech></p>

<p>Even though humor outcomes are describable as positive for those who <term>feel</term> humor, that’s different than saying the <em>overall</em> consequences of humor to a situation are always positive or remain positive—or that people can’t generate humor as part of a wider intention to cause harm.</p>

     <li><strong>OK-predominant influence</strong> <callback>(inertial influence)</callback>&mdash;when we choose the familiar route over another; wear what we have in our closet; use one calendar system and not another; and so on&mdash;we're being influenced by habit or roteness.

<p>In this book, the the emotion of humor is the mechanism of concordant influence. This lets us clarify our humor outcomes with a critical addition&mdash;they're outcomes achieved through <term>concord</term>, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <em>inertia</em> or <em>coercion</em>.</p>

<p>This division of influences is so foundational to our experiences that they can be hard to notice, like breathing. We're also rarely in situations where our only recourse is to concordant influence.

     This is so fundamental to our experience, it's sometimes hard to notice, like breathing. We can't force strangers to be our friend at gunpoint&mdash;if not force, what is the mechanism that makes people experience active concord in dynamic interactions with each other? The mechanism is humor.</p>

<!--        
        Similarly, there's nothing odd about drawing lines around where there's concord and where there's not. If our team laughs and they don't, there's concord if we just look at our team, and a lack of concord if we look at both teams. We can do the same thing with just two people. If one person laughs and the other doesn't, there's internal concord just looking at one person, but only one-sided concord looking at both people.
        
        
        <!--
 <p>Often when laughter upsets us, it's not specifically their <term>humor</term> that upsets us, but the <em>lack of concord</em> that upsets us. This is often our experience with people in power who we describe as "humorless"&mdash;they show no concord.</p>

    <p>The library recognizes an unusual risk, so they decide to put up warning signs. However, due to the unusualness of the risk, they decide they need to actually <humor-outcome>support the argument (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>, not just give an unspecificed "warning" sign.</p> 
    
    <p>Once we recognize that the goal <callback>("<humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>")</callback>is a humor outcome, we can recognize creating this sign is a humor task.</p>
    
    <p>The sign-makers decided to focus on reaching the reaching the humor outcome directly <callback>(outcome-first approach)</callback>. Once they decide this, they don't need to think about "humor" at all&mdash;no need for jokes, comics, cartoon characters, self-reference, or other things stereotypically thought of as "funny."</p>
    
    <p>They instead just focus their efforts on <humor-outcome>supporting an argument.</humor-outcome> <callback>("If our argument is supported, they'll feel humor.")</callback>
     </p> 
    
    <p>This means they focus foremost on presenting a compelling argument. They laid out the reasons for caution, with an implied negative consequences if caution isn't exercised.</p>

    <p>The transit company above wanted to <humor-outcome>support an argument  (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. To reach this humor outcome, they could have focused making a strong argument for caution <callback>(outcome-first: "if they feel our argument is supported, they'll feel humor")</callback>. But instead, they used a cartoony allegory to try to balance mistakes and OK <callback>(emotion-first: "if they feel humor, they'll feel our argument is supported")</callback>.</p>
    
    <p>How did they decide between these methods? They thought about their target audience and how people would use their sign. They knew people may not spend much time looking at this sign, so they wanted to avoid long text or complicated visuals to support their argument. They also knew that not all the people they're trying to reach can read Turkish. So they decide on something visual that can be interpreted fairly quickly.</p>
    
    <p>This led them to decide on an emotion-first method&mdash;when planning out this sign, they focus first on balancing mistakes and OKs, without bothering to think about expectations and sense of security in terms of <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> they think about how to deviate from someone's expectations&mdash;which they do by showing a bumbling figure carelessly skipping toward an ambushing Death.</li> 
        
        <li><strong>OK:</strong> This is balanced by using an abstract and cartoonish style, leaving consequences implied in the future. Our disassociation from the character and outcome lets us feel more secure from negative personal consequences.</li>  
        </ul>
    <p>The designers have to callibrate mistakes and OKs based on their audience. For instance, they can make the sign more or less like other warning signs to modulate the mistake&mdash;or make the drawing more or less realistic to modulate the OK. If the audience feels humor generated by a relevant topic, they'll have <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome> and accomplished their goal.</p>

<div class="content-example">                         
<p>Task: A church wants to prevent cars cutting through their parking lot. So they decide to make a sign to that effect. How do they go about making an effective sign?</p>
            
<p>They start by thinking about they want their sign to achieve: they want to <humor-outcome>control/influence situations (by making drivers voluntarily stop cutting through)</humor-outcome>. In other words, the church wants their sign to generate humor.</p>

<p>They think about the most obvious sign they could think of <callback>("no cutting through")</callback>&mdash;and decide this probably wouldn't generate humor in a way that influenced a situation as much as they would like.</p> 

<p>So they think about using an outcome-first method of design. They brainstorm some of the most obvious ways to rush humor outcome tripwires&mdash;like by listing stats to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>; using a graphic of elderly or young church goers to <humor-outcome>share a perspective</humor-outcome>; bonding with readers by <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome><callback> ("hey, good neighbor!—please don't cut through")</callback>; and so on.</p> 

<p>They evaluate these approaches for suitability. Most of them have drawbacks: graphics are expensive to commission; stats take space to present effectively (especially to people in cars who are distant and fast-moving); elaborate sentences take time to read (which drivers don't always have); and so on.</p>

<p>So they set aside outcome-first methods, and brainstorm emotion-first methods. They take their standard idea <callback>("no cutting through")</callback> and think about how they could make it deviate from people's expectations. They think about adding colors, using an unusual shape or size, choosing an odd font, using odd phrasing; using slang; reverse psychology; and so on.</p>

<p>None of these emotion-first methods add much velocity toward a <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> tripwire. But they <sem>do</sem> have the advantage of meshing with the constraints of their sign.</p>

<p>So they pick a few of the emotion-first ideas that they thought were thematically relevant to the church. They use gothic script and archaic English to make a sign that says "Thou Shall Not Cut Through." They make an emotional forecast that many drivers would have balanced mistakes and OKs at this sign, which would reduce the rate of cutting through by <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>. 
    </p>

<p>Notice that these two methods "outcome-first" and "emotion-first" aren't actually distinct categories—they're just practical ways of relating ourselves to the same process. Both sides in the end <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>&mdash;we're just gaining different perspectives on how we generate humor, and why we take on path and not another.</p>
