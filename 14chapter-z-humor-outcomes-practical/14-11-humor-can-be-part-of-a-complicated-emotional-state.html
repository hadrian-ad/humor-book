Humor outcomes don't always describe the entire emotional state
</h1>


<p>Since humor can be a part of a mixed emotional state, we often feel humor at the same time we feel a mistake-predominant emotion&mdash;like shame:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Minh spends fifteen minutes explaining to Amaya how the mobile game <book-title>Fired Fireman: First-Person Hooter</book-title> had abandoned the things that made the franchise great. He talks and talks and talks and Amaya gets more and more bored.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <speech>“Minh—you’re being just like that fan boy character in <book-title>Fired Fireman 2</book-title>!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <internalaction>(aghast)</internalaction> <speech>“Squire Dorkulous Knows-a-Lot?”</speech> <internalaction>(ruefully)</internalaction> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Ouch!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh experiences both humor and shame)</notes></p>     
    </div>

<p>Minh reaches humor outcomes, like <humor-outcome>being given new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>being acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>an argument being supported</humor-outcome>, and so on—he feels humor. At the same time, the unflattering comparison <sem>also</sem> makes him feel mistake-predominant emotions:</p>

<p>In this case, we can still describe Minh’s humor in terms of <term>good</term> outcomes—but that doesn’t mean his humor can’t <em>coexist</em> with other things we’d describe as less straightforwardly positive, like shame.</p> 

<p>Other times, we might first feel humor, only for the humor to evaporate quickly, leaving us with just negative outcomes:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*leaving*</action> <speech>“See ya!”</speech> <internalaction>(mocking imitation)</internalaction> <speech>“I’m off to the big city to be an ahctress.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    
    <p><strong>A.</strong> <speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jessica feels Elias symbolized close ties and created rapport)</notes> <speech>“I do not sound like that!”</speech></p>

<p>Even though humor outcomes are describable as positive for those who <term>feel</term> humor, that’s different than saying the <em>overall</em> consequences of humor to a situation are always positive or remain positive—or that people can’t generate humor as part of a wider intention to cause harm.</p>

<p>In this book, <humor-outcome>control a situtation</humor-outcome> is a humor outcome&mdash;and the <sem>only</sem> way to <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> is with humor.</p>

<p>This doesn't make sense without an important clarification, since obviously someone can control a situation without humor&mdash;they can make us feel fear by threatening us with a lawsuit, drawing a knife, calling the police, or so on.</p> 

<p>The clarification is this: humor is the only way to <vocab>concordantly</vocab> <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>.</p>

     <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
     <p class="considertext">We're often more familiar with the word "discord" than we are with it's opposite, "concord." But concord is a useful word that implies mutual agreement of purpose. It etymologically means "hearts together."</p>

         <li><strong>Humor influence</strong> <callback>(concordant influence)</callback>&mdash;when we take a willing action on behalf of a friend; street performer; mentor; stranger; and so on&mdash;we're being influenced by concordant methods.</li>

<p>In this book, "evaluatory outcomes" can happen by any mechanism of influence. <sem>Humor</sem> outcomes are the subset of evaluatory outcomes that happen concordantly. The mechanism that concordantly transitions us from no rapport to rapport is humor.</p> 
   
 <p>That means humor is how we <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>reveal a personal review (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, the way we <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize (<outcome-contrast>through concord</outcome-contrast>)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

     <p class="considertext">Note that in the same way we can have mixed emotional states <callback>(anger <sem>and</sem> humor)</callback>, there's nothing odd about various combinations of influences&mdash;like an experience that mingles concord with coercion.</p>
 </div>
 
    
<p>The role of humor as the <sem>mechanism</sem> of concordant influence is so foundational to our experiences, it's hard to even notice, like breathing.</p> 
   
<p>   It's easiest to notice when we think about situations that <sem-weak>require</sem-weak> concord&mdash;like making friends, creating romantic relationships, asking someone to do something for us, motivating volunteers, organizing strangers, and so on.</p> 
    
                   
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">If two friends want to transition to a romantic friendship, they won't get what they want by ignoring each other or threatening each other with lawsuits. That's because what makes those relationships meaningful is the fact that two people want the same thing&mdash;they want a relationship of mutually aligned goals and actions.</p> 
    
    
    <p class="considertext">It's concord, not coercion or roteness, that would create what they want. So their only option is humor&mdash;to concordantly <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tensions</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>help each other feel accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open up new topics of conversations</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We want the same thing everywhere. All things being equal, we'd rather there be concord than not&mdash;with our children, coworkers, friends, municiple government, teams, and so on. Without concord, we often only have the picture of what we want only.</p>  
     </div>        
    
    <p>We could pull a gun or pay money to make someone do something&mdash;but we can't make someone <sem>want</sem> to do those things. If we pull a gun to make someone be our friend, they'll want to not get shot more than they want to be our friend. A similar twist often happens when we offer people money, where they want money and not what the money makes them do.</p> 
             
    <p>Instead, it's concordant influence that makes someone <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to be our friend, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to be at our birthday party, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to volunteer, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to care for mutual space, <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to do us a favor, and so on. It's the same for what motivates us&mdash;a genuine, shared smile with someone and we <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to do things with each other.</p> 
       
        <p>This gives some context for what we've been talking about throughout this book: humor creates and marks concordant internal changes or motivation. When multiple people feel humor for the same reason, the alignment of evaluations is an expression of concord.</p>

        Similarly, there's nothing odd about drawing lines around where there's concord and where there's not. If our team laughs and they don't, there's concord if we just look at our team, and a lack of concord if we look at both teams. We can do the same thing with just two people. If one person laughs and the other doesn't, there's internal concord just looking at one person, but only one-sided concord looking at both people.

    <p>The transit company above wanted to <humor-outcome>support an argument  (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. To reach this humor outcome, they could have focused making a strong argument for caution <callback>(outcome-first: "if they feel our argument is supported, they'll feel humor")</callback>. But instead, they used a cartoony allegory to try to balance mistakes and OK <callback>(emotion-first: "if they feel humor, they'll feel our argument is supported")</callback>.</p>
    
    <p>How did they decide between these methods? They thought about their target audience and how people would use their sign. They knew people may not spend much time looking at this sign, so they wanted to avoid long text or complicated visuals to support their argument. They also knew that not all the people they're trying to reach can read Turkish. So they decide on something visual that can be interpreted fairly quickly.</p>
    
    <p>This led them to decide on an emotion-first method&mdash;when planning out this sign, they focus first on balancing mistakes and OKs, without bothering to think about expectations and sense of security in terms of <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li><strong>Mistake:</strong> they think about how to deviate from someone's expectations&mdash;which they do by showing a bumbling figure carelessly skipping toward an ambushing Death.</li> 
        
        <li><strong>OK:</strong> This is balanced by using an abstract and cartoonish style, leaving consequences implied in the future. Our disassociation from the character and outcome lets us feel more secure from negative personal consequences.</li>  
        </ul>
    <p>The designers have to callibrate mistakes and OKs based on their audience. For instance, they can make the sign more or less like other warning signs to modulate the mistake&mdash;or make the drawing more or less realistic to modulate the OK. If the audience feels humor generated by a relevant topic, they'll have <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome> and accomplished their goal.</p>

<p>Task: A church wants to prevent cars cutting through their parking lot. So they decide to make a sign to that effect. How do they go about making an effective sign?</p>
            
<p>They start by thinking about they want their sign to achieve: they want to <humor-outcome>control/influence situations (by making drivers voluntarily stop cutting through)</humor-outcome>. In other words, the church wants their sign to generate humor.</p>

<p>They think about the most obvious sign they could think of <callback>("no cutting through")</callback>&mdash;and decide this probably wouldn't generate humor in a way that influenced a situation as much as they would like.</p> 

<p>So they think about using an outcome-first method of design. They brainstorm some of the most obvious ways to rush humor outcome tripwires&mdash;like by listing stats to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>; using a graphic of elderly or young church goers to <humor-outcome>share a perspective</humor-outcome>; bonding with readers by <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome><callback> ("hey, good neighbor!—please don't cut through")</callback>; and so on.</p>

Most of them have drawbacks: graphics are expensive to commission; stats take space to present effectively (especially to people in cars who are distant and fast-moving); elaborate sentences take time to read (which drivers don't always have); and so on.</p>

<p>So they set aside outcome-first methods, and brainstorm emotion-first methods. They take their standard idea <callback>("no cutting through")</callback> and think about how they could make it deviate from people's expectations. They think about adding colors, using an unusual shape or size, choosing an odd font, using odd phrasing; using slang; reverse psychology; and so on.</p>

<p>None of these emotion-first methods add much velocity toward a <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> tripwire. But they <sem>do</sem> have the advantage of meshing with the constraints of their sign.</p>

<p>So they pick a few of the emotion-first ideas that they thought were thematically relevant to the church. They use gothic script and archaic English to make a sign that says "Thou Shall Not Cut Through." They make an emotional forecast that many drivers would have balanced mistakes and OKs at this sign, which would reduce the rate of cutting through by <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>.

<p>Notice that these two methods "outcome-first" and "emotion-first" aren't actually distinct categories—they're just practical ways of relating ourselves to the same process. Both sides in the end <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>&mdash;we're just gaining different perspectives on how we generate humor, and why we take on path and not another.</p>
