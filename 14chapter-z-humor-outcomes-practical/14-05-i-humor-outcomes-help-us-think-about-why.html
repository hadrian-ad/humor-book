15. Explaining humor 
</h1>


<p>When using humor outcomes to explain humor's relation to something like a title, we start by picking the humor outcome that seems most relevant:</p>  

 
<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 
    
        <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-05-humor-outcome-why/wherever-you-go.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >
    

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>The Big Book of Masturbation: From Angst to Zeal</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <humor-outcome>dealt with taboo topics</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
        <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-05-humor-outcome-why/big-book-of-masturbation.sketchpad.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</book-title> She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <humor-outcome>eased tension</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    </div> 
            <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-05-humor-outcome-why/why-by-happy.sketchpad.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >
    
    
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe felt an <humor-outcome>argument was supported</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 
    
            <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-05-humor-outcome-why/in-a-cold-crater.sketchpad.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 30rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >
    
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>A Queer and Pleasant Danger</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe felt <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>)</notes></p> 
        </div>
        
                <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-05-humor-outcome-why/queer-pleasant-danger.sketchpad.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
     >

<p>In each case, Zoe feels humor because she reached a humor outcome, like <humor-outcome>taboo topics were dealt with</humor-outcome>, and so on. This lets us work backward&mdash;what was taboo, and how was it dealt with?</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">As before, humor outcomes are all different ways of describing the same thing <callback>("humor")</callback>&mdash;so we can use as many humor outcomes as we think would be useful:</p>
        
                <img src=../images/14c-images-humor-outcomes/14-05-humor-outcome-why/big-book-of-masturbation-complete.png
        
            alt="";
            title="";
            style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: 0rem; margin-top: 1rem" 
             >
    <p class="considertext">We can use the same process, just repeated multiple times: since Zoe <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, what was that perspective, and how was it delivered? Since Zoe <humor-outcome>eased tension</humor-outcome>, why was there tension to begin with, and what eased it?</p>
    </div>

<p>This gives us a handhold into thinking a bit more concretely about why someone feels humor when looking at something like a book title.</p>    
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Push.</headline> Zoe may not feel humor when she reads the title <book-title>In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948</book-title>. But she may still recognize something humorous about the title.</p> 
    
    <p>We can use humor outcomes to think about why we think some things are "humorous"—we think the author or publishers were <sem-weak>intending</sem-weak> readers to feel <humor-outcome>an argument was supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives were given</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>something was acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>When Zoe thinks she sees these intentions, she describes the vehicle for those intentions as "humorous." That doesn't mean she necessarily <term>feels</term> humor&mdash;it just means she sees the <em>push</em> toward humor outcomes. This is why we can describe a variety of things as humorous, even if we find them appalling or unfunny.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, there's nothing strange about someone intending us to feel both mistake-predominant emotions <sem>and</sem> humor simultaneously. An editor may title a book hoping that a reader finds that the title <humor-outcome>supports an argument</humor-outcome> even at the same time hoping we find it grim and severe.</p>

<p>If we only have abstract or technical ways of talking about humor, it can be hard to talk our actual experiences. Humor outcomes give us ways of talking narratively about humor:</p>

<div class="content-example">

<div class="vignette">
        <p>
            <narration>Sam and Jennifer are taking Riley to the kid-friendly farm. A sign at the goat enclosure says</narration> <speech>“GOATS HAVE NO MANNERS.”</speech>
        </p>
        <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam and Jennifer feel the sign supports an argument)</notes></p>

     >

    <p>To be concise, we can pick one or two humor outcomes that elegantly describe a situation. But since humor outcomes overlap and re-describe the same thing, we can use any or all humor outcomes too.</p>

<p>For instance, the sign with the goat doesn’t <term>only</term> <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>—it <em>also</em> <humor-outcome>creates rapport</humor-outcome>, makes Sam and Jennifer <humor-outcome>feel accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deals with stress</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>pre-emptively handles complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>opens a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizes goats and attendees</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolizes close ties (to goats and customers)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controls a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoids conflict</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<p>Usually, the more humor outcomes we use to characterize humor, the more some of them will feel non-standard or poetic. While we usually discard these, they're also useful in seeing an emotional situation in new light.</p>
