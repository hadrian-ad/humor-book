    Answering more questions using sizes
</h1>
 <!--   03.70-->
  
<p>
    We can continue using sizes of mistakes and OKs to make sense of humor:
</p>
<h2>Why can shows with such wildly different tones generate about equal amounts of humor?</h2>
  <div class="h2"> 
          <div class="vignette">
              <p><narration>Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Office People</book-title>, where an outing to a sushi restaurant makes for a hilarious climactic scene. Everyone gets up to head to their coworker's wedding—but they realize their car keys were accidentally put into the jacket of a businessman! They have to scramble to recover them. It’s a really funny scene.</narration>
          </p>
       <p>
           <narration>Next, Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Animated Guy</book-title>, where the climactic scene is a joust to the death among friends from the tops of limousines. Everyone dies horribly, and it’s really funny. Owen knows that whenever characters die in this show, they’re always back alive in the concluding scene.</narration></p>
       <p>
           <narration>Owen thinks both scenes were about equally funny. Which is weird, because they were so tonally different!</narration>
       </p>
       </div>
       
       <img
       src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-7-sizes-of-mistakes-and-oks-help-us-answer-questions-ii/3-7-0-intensity-at-different-sizes.png"
       Title="We can feel intense humor from small evaluations as well as large evaluations as long as they balance"
       Alt="This image combines scales with our evaluation tables. the scale for Animated Guy is balanced with a large mistake box and large OK box. The scale for Office People is balanced with a small mistake box and a small OK box. Both generate intense humor, and are plotted on the evaluations table. This shows that both are on the line of most-intense humor, despite having different sizes of evaluations."
       style="max-width: 40rem;"
       > 
       
       <p>
       The tone of the show sets the overall OK. If Owen knows that characters can die and be alive again in the next scene, he has a large OK—which then needs a large mistake <callback>(limousine jousting)</callback> to balance the OK and generate humor.</p>
       
       <p>
           On the other hand, if Owen relates to more realistic characters in a show with more realistic consequences, then Owen has a smaller OK—which are balanced by smaller mistakes <callback>(misplacing car keys)</callback> to produce intense humor.</p>
       
       <p>
           This means both shows will have their own sweet spot that generates intense humor—even though these sweet spots are tonally different.</p>

<h2>Why does the genre of something influence the humor we feel from it?</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <div class="vignette">
       <p>
        <narration>Artem is reading the opening paragraph of Soviet novel <book-title>The Foundation Pit</book-title>:</narration></p>
        
        <p class="bookquote">“On the day of the thirtieth anniversary of his private life, Voshchev was made redundant from the small machine factory where he obtained the means for his existence…”</p>

    Title="If we're told a genre, it influences our evaluations"
    Alt="This flowchart has a large mistake box labeled 'Voschev was made redundant from the small machine factory where he obtained the means for his existence...', leading either to 1) a small OK box labeled 'we think the book is a tragedy,' which leads to no humor or to 2) a large OK box labeled 'we think the book is a dark comedy,' which leads to humor."
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 
    
    <p>
        The genre influences how we evaluate the size of the mistakes and OKs. If the front of the book said it was a <term>dark comedy</term>
        <callback>("a masterpiece of dark humor")</callback>, we’d be more likely to evaluate the mistakes and OKs in a way that would generate some humor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, if the front of the book said it was a <em>tragedy</em> <callback>("a masterpiece of human suffering")</callback>, we may evaluate things so that there was less humor. 
    </p>
    <p>
       When we’re not confident in how we’re “supposed” to be feeling, we can feel some evaluatory ambiguity. We may oscillate between a big OK and a small OK, which leads to bewilderment or mixed emotional states. <callback>(“I can’t tell if this is hilarious absurdism or unrelievedly grim.”)</callback>

<div class="content-example">
       
<p>In this book, we'll be as interested in understanding low-intensity humor as we are high-intensity humor.</p> 
   
<div class="for-instance">
                 <p class="for-instance">For instance</p>
                  
<p class="for-instance-text">Someone who is angry is different than someone who is angry and also feels a tiny bit of humor. We want to know all about this tiny bit of humor!</p>
                  </div>
              
<p>In many ways, our overall skill with humor is defined by our understanding of low-intensity humor. This is just like any skill, like cooking&mdash;we can all make sense of ketchup, but the next step is to have greater awareness and control over smaller elements of tasting and cooking.</p>

<p>This helps us not only understand why something turned out the way it did&mdash;it also allows us to build our own dishes.</p>
                      
It's similar for aesthetics.                                                         
<p>We sometimes think <term>high</term>-intensity humor matters <sem>more</sem> than <em>low</em>-intensity humor&mdash;like that a belly laugh is inherently better and more interesting that a small laugh. Sometimes we even think we don't need to think about low-intensity humor at all.<p>

<p>But we know with a comparison to food that this isn't quite right. If we eat an orange-zest brownie, we wouldn’t say the orange-zest is unimportant just because chocolate is by far the most prominent flavor&mdash;or say that we <sem-weak>only</sem-weak> tasted chocolate. </p>

<p>It's the same for our emotions. We can't ignore low-intensity humor, since that still flavors the entire experience.</p>

<p>Similarly, we know an all-blue panel is different than a similar panel with an orange dot in the middle:</p>
	
<img class="img-indent" src="../images/1c-images-emotions/1-6-deeper-look-images/2-6-7-blue.png" title="Comparison of blue boxes" alt="Two blue squares are contrasted, one all-blue and the other all-blue with an orange dot in it."

style="max-width: 14rem;">

<p>If we thought <callback>"well, they're both intensely blue, so they're the same"</callback> or <callback>"well the orange here is small so isn't doing anything"</callback>&mdash;we'll lose track of important nuance. 


<p>It's the same for our emotions. It's not the same to be angry compared to being angry with a little dot of humor in it. When we understand what the difference between the two is, we can observe and react with greater skill.</p>

       
<div class="consider">
            <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            <p class="considertext">With cooking or graphic design, we have the sense that improving in them in part means gaining a greater awareness and understanding of "small amounts." </p>
                   
                 <p class="considertext">  It's the same for improving in humor&mdash;improving in part means gaining a greater awareness of low-intensity humor </p>
        </div>
        
 
<p>In this book, we'll be as inclusive of these low-intensity experiences of humor as we are of high-intensity experiences of humor. We want an understanding of humor that isn't limited to intense humor, but understands <sem>all</sem> intensities of humor.</p>

    Humor isn't just "on" or "off." Instead, it's something that has degrees of intensity. We can model intensity by thinking of mistakes and OKs as having a magnitude.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We can intuitively sort comparative mistakes and OKs by <strong><a href="3-1-mistakes-have-a-size.html">magnitude</a></strong>. This magnitude is the degree that something deviates from our expectations <callback>("size" of mistake)</callback>&mdash;or the degree that that mistake feels secure from negative personal consequences <callback>("size" of OK)</callback>. 
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        The magnitude lets our inputs <callback>(mistake, OK)</callback>
        return a ratio output. We feel humor most <strong><a href="3-3-humor-is-most-intense-when-the-sizes-of-mistakes-and-OKs-match.html">intensely</a></strong> when the ratio of mistake and OK is 1.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        We feel less intense humor in proportion to <strong><a href="3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor.html">how far</a></strong> the ratio of our evaluations is from 1.
