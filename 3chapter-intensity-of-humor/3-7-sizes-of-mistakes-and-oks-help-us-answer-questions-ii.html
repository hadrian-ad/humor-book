    Answering more questions using sizes
</h1>

<p>
    We can continue using sizes of mistakes and OKs to make sense of humor:
</p>
<h2>Why can shows with such wildly different tones generate about equal amounts of humor?</h2>
  <div class="h2"> 
          <div class="vignette">
              <p><narration>Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Office People</book-title>, where an outing to a sushi restaurant makes for a hilarious climactic scene. Everyone gets up to head to their coworker's wedding—but they realize their car keys were accidentally put into the jacket of a businessman! They have to scramble to recover them. It’s a really funny scene.</narration>
          </p>
       <p>
           <narration>Next, Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Animated Guy</book-title>, where the climactic scene is a joust to the death among friends from the tops of limousines. Everyone dies horribly, and it’s really funny. Owen knows that whenever characters die in this show, they’re always back alive in the concluding scene.</narration></p>
       <p>
           <narration>Owen thinks both scenes were about equally funny. Which is weird, because they were so tonally different!</narration>
       </p>
       </div>
       
       <img
       src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-7-sizes-of-mistakes-and-oks-help-us-answer-questions-ii/3-7-0-intensity-at-different-sizes.png"
       Title="We can feel intense humor from small evaluations as well as large evaluations as long as they balance"
       Alt="This image combines scales with our evaluation tables. the scale for Animated Guy is balanced with a large mistake box and large OK box. The scale for Office People is balanced with a small mistake box and a small OK box. Both generate intense humor, and are plotted on the evaluations table. This shows that both are on the line of most-intense humor, despite having different sizes of evaluations."
       style="max-width: 40rem;"
       > 
       
       <p>
       The tone of the show sets the overall OK. If Owen knows that characters can die and be alive again in the next scene, he has a large OK—which then needs a large mistake <callback>(limousine jousting)</callback> to balance the OK and generate humor.</p>
       
       <p>
           On the other hand, if Owen relates to more realistic characters in a show with more realistic consequences, then Owen has a smaller OK—which are balanced by smaller mistakes <callback>(misplacing car keys)</callback> to produce intense humor.</p>
       
       <p>
           This means both shows will have their own sweet spot that generates intense humor—even though these sweet spots are tonally different.</p>

<h2>Why does the genre of something influence the humor we feel from it?</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <div class="vignette">
       <p>
        <narration>Artem is reading the opening paragraph of Soviet novel <book-title>The Foundation Pit</book-title>:</narration></p>

    Title="If we're told a genre, it influences our evaluations"
    Alt="This flowchart has a large mistake box labeled 'Voschev was made redundant from the small machine factory where he obtained the means for his existence...', leading either to 1) a small OK box labeled 'we think the book is a tragedy,' which leads to no humor or to 2) a large OK box labeled 'we think the book is a dark comedy,' which leads to humor."
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 
    
    <p>
        The genre influences how we evaluate the size of the mistakes and OKs. If the front of the book said it was a <term>dark comedy</term>
        <callback>("a masterpiece of dark humor")</callback>, we’d be more likely to evaluate the mistakes and OKs in a way that would generate some humor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, if the front of the book said it was a <em>tragedy</em> <callback>("a masterpiece of human suffering")</callback>, we may evaluate things so that there was less humor. 
    </p>
    <p>
       When we’re not confident in how we’re “supposed” to be feeling, we can feel some evaluatory ambiguity. We may oscillate between a big OK and a small OK, which leads to bewilderment or mixed emotional states. <callback>(“I can’t tell if this is hilarious absurdism or unrelievedly grim.”)</callback>

<p>At first, it can seem like we should care more about high-intensity humor  than low-intensity humor&mdash;but that's not really true. We can see this by thinking about "low-intensity" colors.</p> 
 
 <p>In our heads, the sky is often the most vivid blue imaginable. But when we actually look at the sky, we see it's a pale and thin blue: </p>

<!--
 <p>A book about color would help us think through all this in different contexts, including answering questions like:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
  
   <li>what makes blues different from each other? How do we describe them?</li>
   
   <li>when is a pale blue might be preferable to a sharper blue, and why?</li>
        
    <li>what makes colors work harmoniously together or not?</li>
    
    <li>why someone might chose the colors they did, and what does that mean about them or their goals?</li>

    Title="The sky is pale"
    Alt="This picture of the sky highlights the pale, washed out blue of the sky. An annotation says that focusing on colors not often in nature would make it harder to understand the world around us."
    
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 

   <p>The same is true all across our lives, where we assume there were more vivid colors than were actually at a vivid experience:</p>
    

    <img
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-1-meadow-color.jpg"
    Title="Meadow"
    Alt="This picture shows a meadow with a manor in the background. The meadow has a pale sky, lots of brownish green, and some yellow flowers."
    style="max-width: 26rem;"
    > 
    
    <p>When asked to remember a beautiful field, we'd probably remember "intense" colors. But when we actually take a <sem-weak>look</sem-weak> at fields, we often see more muted colors than we expect, including brown greens and pale blues.</p>
    
    <p>Similarly, while we may remember the field as a beautiful full yellow from flowers, we may actually find that effect was created by just few scattered flowers&mdash;since it doesn't always take much yellow to create a vivid impression.</p>
    
    <p>That's because a lot of our assumptions about the association between color, vividness, and experiences aren't quite right&mdash;and we have to switch from describing what we <term>expect</term> to describing what we <em>actually</em> see.</p>
    
    <p>In other words, we'd want a book about color to help us think about how colors and the world worked <sem>everywhere</sem>&mdash;and to be able to think accurately about all "intensities" of color.</p>

    <img
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-2-color-comparison.png"
    Title="All shades of blue are interesting"
    Alt="This comparison shows two different hues of blue, and notes that a book on color would be interested in both of them."
    style="max-width: 15rem;"
    > 


      <p>A study of <sem>only</sem> "high-intensity" colors would remove us from common experiences, like living under the sky&mdash;and mainly equip us to think about a narrow range of things.</p>
      
      <img
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-3-animated-sky-comparison.png"
    Title="We often misremember colors"
    Alt="This image compares a picture of an animated sky, which is a saturated blue, with the previous picture of the sky, which is a washed out blue. An annotation says we often remember the sky as it looks in created things, not how it looks in the world."
    
    style="max-width: 26rem;"
    > 

 
<p>This is all true of humor as well. While what stands out in our memories may be belly laughter, when we actually start looking at the humor in our lives&mdash;the majority of it happens at a low-intensity.</p> 

<p>Low-intensity humor, like colors, can seem washed out in a <term>comedy</term>&mdash;but, like the coloring of a field, low-intensity humor can be vivid and intense in other contexts of our <em>lives</em>.</p> 

<p>And in the same way just a bit of <term>yellow</term> made a big difference in the field above, just a bit of <em>humor</em> makes a big difference in an emotional state&mdash;like how a little bit of orange below makes a big difference:</p> 
  
  <img
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-4-dots-of-orange.png"
    Title="Little bits of color matter"
    Alt="This comparison shows an all-blue box and an all-blue box with a dot of orange in it. An annotation says these two boxes aren't the same."
    style="max-width: 17rem;"
    > 
  
<p>Even though the orange was "low-intensity" compared to the blue, that didn't mean it wasn't relevant. To understand colors and make aesthetic decisions, we'd have to take the presence or absence of this bit of orange seriously.</p>

<p>Something similar happens for emotions. "Anger" and "anger with a bit of humor" are not the same emotional states:</p> 

<img
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-low-intensity-humor/cl-5-dots-of-humor.png"
    Title="Little bits of emotion matter"
    Alt="This comparison shows two emotional state boxes, one with all-anger, and the other all-anger with a bit of humor in it. An annotation says these two boxes are not the same."
    style="max-width: 17rem;"
    > 

  
<p>This book will be focusing on humor everywhere, of any intensity&mdash;and focusing on understanding what that humor means. This will give us genuine understanding of humor as it happens in the world, which will include but not be limited to things like comedies.</p>

    <p>
    Humor isn't just "on" or "off." Instead, it's something that has degrees of intensity. We can model <vocab>intensity</vocab> by thinking of mistakes and OKs as having a magnitude.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We can intuitively sort comparative mistakes and OKs by <strong><a href="3-1-mistakes-have-a-size.html">magnitude</a></strong>. This magnitude is the degree that something deviates from our expectations <callback>("size" of mistake)</callback>&mdash;or the degree that that mistake feels secure from negative personal consequences <callback>("size" of OK)</callback>. 
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        The magnitude lets our inputs <callback>(mistake, OK)</callback>
        return a ratio output. We feel humor most <strong><a href="3-3-humor-is-most-intense-when-the-sizes-of-mistakes-and-OKs-match.html">intensely</a></strong> when the ratio of mistake and OK is 1.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        We feel less intense humor in proportion to <strong><a href="3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor.html">how far</a></strong> the ratio of our evaluations is from 1.
