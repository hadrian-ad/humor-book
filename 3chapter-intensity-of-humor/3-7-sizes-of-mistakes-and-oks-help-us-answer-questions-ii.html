    Answering more questions using sizes
</h1>

<p>
    We can continue using sizes of mistakes and OKs to make sense of humor:
</p>
<h2>Why can shows with such wildly different tones generate about equal amounts of humor?</h2>
  <div class="h2"> 
          <div class="vignette">
              <p><narration>Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Office People</book-title>, where an outing to a sushi restaurant makes for a hilarious climactic scene. Everyone gets up to head to their coworker's wedding—but they realize their car keys were accidentally put into the jacket of a businessman! They have to scramble to recover them. It’s a really funny scene.</narration>
          </p>
       <p>
           <narration>Next, Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Animated Guy</book-title>, where the climactic scene is a joust to the death among friends from the tops of limousines. Everyone dies horribly, and it’s really funny. Owen knows that whenever characters die in this show, they’re always back alive in the concluding scene.</narration></p>
       <p>
           <narration>Owen thinks both scenes were about equally funny. Which is weird, because they were so tonally different!</narration>
       </p>
       </div>
       
       <img
       src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-7-sizes-of-mistakes-and-oks-help-us-answer-questions-ii/3-7-0-intensity-at-different-sizes.png"
       Title="We can feel intense humor from small evaluations as well as large evaluations as long as they balance"
       Alt="This image combines scales with our evaluation tables. the scale for Animated Guy is balanced with a large mistake box and large OK box. The scale for Office People is balanced with a small mistake box and a small OK box. Both generate intense humor, and are plotted on the evaluations table. This shows that both are on the line of most-intense humor, despite having different sizes of evaluations."
       style="max-width: 40rem;"
       > 
       
       <p>
       The tone of the show sets the overall OK. If Owen knows that characters can die and be alive again in the next scene, he has a large OK—which then needs a large mistake <callback>(limousine jousting)</callback> to balance the OK and generate humor.</p>
       
       <p>
           On the other hand, if Owen relates to more realistic characters in a show with more realistic consequences, then Owen has a smaller OK—which are balanced by smaller mistakes <callback>(misplacing car keys)</callback> to produce intense humor.</p>
       
       <p>
           This means both shows will have their own sweet spot that generates intense humor—even though these sweet spots are tonally different.</p>

<h2>Why does the genre of something influence the humor we feel from it?</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <div class="vignette">
       <p>
        <narration>Artem is reading the opening paragraph of Soviet novel <book-title>The Foundation Pit</book-title>:</narration></p>

    Title="If we're told a genre, it influences our evaluations"
    Alt="This flowchart has a large mistake box labeled 'Voschev was made redundant from the small machine factory where he obtained the means for his existence...', leading either to 1) a small OK box labeled 'we think the book is a tragedy,' which leads to no humor or to 2) a large OK box labeled 'we think the book is a dark comedy,' which leads to humor."
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 
    
    <p>
        The genre influences how we evaluate the size of the mistakes and OKs. If the front of the book said it was a <term>dark comedy</term>
        <callback>("a masterpiece of dark humor")</callback>, we’d be more likely to evaluate the mistakes and OKs in a way that would generate some humor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, if the front of the book said it was a <em>tragedy</em> <callback>("a masterpiece of human suffering")</callback>, we may evaluate things so that there was less humor. 
    </p>
    <p>
       When we’re not confident in how we’re “supposed” to be feeling, we can feel some evaluatory ambiguity. We may oscillate between a big OK and a small OK, which leads to bewilderment or mixed emotional states. <callback>(“I can’t tell if this is hilarious absurdism or unrelievedly grim.”)</callback>

<div class="content-example">
       
<p>In this book, we'll be as interested in learning about <term>low-intensity</term> humor as <em>high-intensity</em> humor. We can understand this by an analogy to a book about color.</p>

<p>A book that only focused on bright colors would just be a book about bright colors&mdash;not about colors generally. We'd probably first prefer grounding in using and understanding all colors:</p>

    <img
    src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-7-sizes-of-mistakes-and-oks-help-us-answer-questions-ii/3-7-2-deeper-saturation.png"
    Title="All shades of blue are interesting"
    Alt="This comparison shows two different hues of blue, and notes that a book on color would be interested in both of them."
    style="max-width: 15rem;"
    > 

<p>Is a pale blue a "bad" form of blue that's less important? Not really&mdash;instead, we'd want to be able to think through color questions like:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
  
   <li>what makes blues different from each other? How do we describe them?</li>
   
   <li>when is a pale blue might be preferable to a sharper blue, and why?</li>

        
    <li>what makes colors work harmoniously together or not?</li>
    
    <li>why someone might chose the colors they did, and what does that mean about them or their goals?</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>


<p>Often, animated movies will use a very vivid blue for things like the sky. But when we actually take time to look at the sky in real life, it's usually a pale and thin blue:</p> 

    <img
    src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-7-sizes-of-mistakes-and-oks-help-us-answer-questions-ii/3-7-3-deeper-sky.png"
    Title="The sky is pale"
    Alt="This picture of the sky highlights the pale, washed out blue of the sky. An annotation says that focusing on colors not often in nature would make it harder to understand the world around us."
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 

<p>So understanding pale blues ends up helping us understand the world around us&mdash;even more so than if we only focused on vivid blues.</p> 
    
<p>Moreover, colors never exist on their own. They relate to each other in a way that creates the actual big picture we experience.</p> 
    
    <p>We may look at a picture of a field that <sem-weak>feels</sem-weak> vivid to be in&mdash;but that vivid experience is actually built from a lot of muted colors&mdash;including brown greens, pale blues, and scattered yellow:</p> 

    <img
    src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-7-sizes-of-mistakes-and-oks-help-us-answer-questions-ii/3-7-4-deeper-sky-combination.jpg"
    Title="Meadow"
    Alt="This picture shows a meadow with a manor in the background. The meadow has a pale sky, lots of brownish green, and some yellow flowers."
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 

<p>This is sometimes not what we expect. At first, we might assume that very saturated colors would lead to more vivid experiences, every time. But when we stop to think about it, we know that's not really true&mdash;there's more going on. 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">A book on color ideally would help us make sense of what we actually find evocative and not, when, and why that is.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">That might be why a supersaturated blue sky in an animated movie is enjoyable, <sem-weak>as well as</sem-weak> why a pale blue sky in our lives can be exceedingly beautiful.</p>
    </div>

<p>There's something similar about humor. Even though we tend to think of humor as a long belly laugh, when we actually start looking for humor in our lives, much of our humor is felt at a low-intensity.</p> 

<p>Humor, like all emotions, is something that forms a big picture through combination of everything. The picture of the meadow above has just a bit of yellow in it, which makes a big difference&mdash;it's the same with humor, where just a bit makes a big difference.</p>  

<p>This is obvious with color. The panels below aren't the same&mdash;just a bit of orange changes it into something different, even though both panels have a lot of blue in them:</p> 
  
  <img
    src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-7-sizes-of-mistakes-and-oks-help-us-answer-questions-ii/3-7-5-deeper-dots-of-orange.png"
    Title="Little bits of color matter"
    Alt="This comparison shows an all-blue box and an all-blue box with a dot of orange in it. An annotation says these two boxes aren't the same."
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 
  
<p>It's the same for emotions. An emotional state that's just angry and an emotional state that's just mostly angry but with a bit of humor is not the same thing. In this case, the low-intensity humor in the emotional state is profoundly important:</p> 

<img
    src="../images/3c-images-sizes/3-7-sizes-of-mistakes-and-oks-help-us-answer-questions-ii/3-7-6-deeper-dots-of-humor.png"
    Title="Little bits of emotion matter"
    Alt="This comparison shows two emotional state boxes, one with all-anger, and the other all-anger with a bit of humor in it. An annotation says these two boxes are not the same."
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 

<p>Throughout this book, we'll be looking at humor at all intensities, and thinking about how it fits into life in all its different ways. That includes considering both high- and low-intensities of humor.</p>

    Humor isn't just "on" or "off." Instead, it's something that has degrees of intensity. We can model intensity by thinking of mistakes and OKs as having a magnitude.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We can intuitively sort comparative mistakes and OKs by <strong><a href="3-1-mistakes-have-a-size.html">magnitude</a></strong>. This magnitude is the degree that something deviates from our expectations <callback>("size" of mistake)</callback>&mdash;or the degree that that mistake feels secure from negative personal consequences <callback>("size" of OK)</callback>. 
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        The magnitude lets our inputs <callback>(mistake, OK)</callback>
        return a ratio output. We feel humor most <strong><a href="3-3-humor-is-most-intense-when-the-sizes-of-mistakes-and-OKs-match.html">intensely</a></strong> when the ratio of mistake and OK is 1.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        We feel less intense humor in proportion to <strong><a href="3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor.html">how far</a></strong> the ratio of our evaluations is from 1.
    </li>
</ul>
