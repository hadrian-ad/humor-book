    Answering more questions using sizes

<p>
    We can continue using sizes of mistakes and OKs to make sense of humor:
</p>
<h2>Why can shows with such wildly different tones generate about equal amounts of humor?</h2>
  <div class="h2"> 
          <div class="vignette">
              <p><narration>Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Office People</book-title>, where an outing to a sushi restaurant makes for a hilarious climactic scene. Everyone gets up to head to their coworker's wedding—but they realize their car keys were accidentally put into the jacket of a businessman! They have to scramble to recover them. It’s a really funny scene.</narration>
          </p>
       <p>
           <narration>Next, Owen watches an episode of <book-title>Animated Guy</book-title>, where the climactic scene is a joust to the death among friends from the tops of limousines. Everyone dies horribly, and it’s really funny. Owen knows that whenever characters die in this show, they’re always back alive in the concluding scene.</narration></p>
       <p>
           <narration>Owen thinks both scenes were about equally funny. Which is weird, because they were so tonally different!</narration>
       </p>

       Title="We can feel intense humor from small balanced evaluations as well as large balanced evaluations"
       Alt="This image combines scales with our evaluations table. the scale for Animated Guy is balanced with a large mistake box and large OK box. The scale for Office People is balanced with a small mistake box and a small OK box. Both generate intense humor, and are plotted on the evaluations table to show both are on the line of most-intense humor."
       style="max-width: 40rem;"
       > 
       
       <p>
       The tone of the show sets the overall OK. If Owen knows that characters can die and be alive again in the next scene, he has a large OK—which then needs a large mistake <callback>(limousine jousting)</callback> to balance the OK and generate humor.</p>
       
       <p>
           On the other hand, if Owen relates to more realistic characters in a show with more realistic consequences, then Owen has a smaller OK—which are balanced by smaller mistakes <callback>(misplacing car keys)</callback> to produce intense humor.</p>
       
       <p>
           This means both shows will have their own sweet spot that generates intense humor—even though these sweet spots are tonally different.</p>

        <p>A show like <i>Family Guy</i> will use large mistakes, while the people who find it funny will have large OKs:</p>

<p>We might find either of these clips to be uncomfortable or boring if our mistakes and OKs aren't balanced. But note that <term>we</term> don't have to feel humor from these clips to think about why <em>Owen</em> did or didn't feel humor from them. If Owen  laughs, we can think about how he's evaluating things, and why that might be the case for him specifically.</p>

<h2>Why does the genre of something influence the humor we feel from it?</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <div class="vignette">
       <p>
        <narration>Artem is reading the opening paragraph of Soviet novel <book-title>The Foundation Pit</book-title>:</narration></p>
        
        <p class="bookquote">“On the day of the thirtieth anniversary of his private life, Voshchev was made redundant from the small machine factory where he obtained the means for his existence…”</p>
    <p>
    <speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*looks up*</action> <internalaction>(thinking)</internalaction> <speech>“I can’t tell if this is hilarious absurdism or unrelievedly grim.”</speech>

    Title="If we're told a genre, it influences our evaluations"
    Alt="This flowchart has a large mistake box labeled 'Voschev was made redundant from the small machine factory where he obtained the means for his existence...', leading either to a small OK box labeled 'we think the book is a tragedy' leading to no humor or to a large OK box labeled 'we think the book is a dark comedy' leading to humor."
    style="max-width: 20rem;"
    > 
    
    <p>
        The genre influences how we evaluate the size of the mistakes and OKs. If the front of the book said it was a <term>dark comedy</term>
        <callback>("a masterpiece of dark humor")</callback>, we’d be more likely to evaluate the mistakes and OKs in a way that would generate some humor. 
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, if the front of the book said it was a <em>tragedy</em> <callback>("a masterpiece of human suffering")</callback>, we may evaluate things so that there was less humor. 
    </p>
    <p>
       When we’re not confident in how we’re “supposed” to be feeling, we can feel some evaluatory ambiguity. We may oscillate between a big OK and a small OK, which leads to bewilderment or mixed emotional states. <callback>(“I can’t tell if this is hilarious absurdism or unrelievedly grim.”)</callback>

    <p>
    Humor isn't just "on" or "off." Instead, it's something that has degrees of intensity. We can model intensity by thinking of mistakes and OKs as having a magnitude.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        We can intuitively sort comparative mistakes and OKs by <strong><a href="3-1-mistakes-have-a-size.html">magnitude</a></strong>. This magnitude is the degree that something deviates from our expectations <callback>("size" of mistake)</callback>&mdash;or the degree that that mistake feels secure from negative personal consequences <callback>("size" of OK)</callback>. 
    </li>
</ul>
<ul>
    <li>
        The magnitude lets our inputs <callback>(mistake, OK)</callback>
        return an ratio output. We feel humor most <strong><a href="3-3-humor-is-most-intense-when-the-sizes-of-mistakes-and-OKs-match.html">intensely</a></strong> when the ratio of mistake and OK is 1.
    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>
        We feel less intense humor in proportion to <strong><a href="3-5-graphing-the-intensity-of-humor.html">how far</a></strong> the ratio of our evaluations is from 1.
    </li>
</ul>
