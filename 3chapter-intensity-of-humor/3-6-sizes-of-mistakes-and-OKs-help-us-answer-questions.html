Sizes of mistakes and OKs help us answer questions
</h1>
<!--   03.60-->

<p>
	Once we add sizes of mistakes and OKs to our model of humor, we're ready tangibly answer some questions that otherwise may seem abstract or hard to answer:  
</p>
<h2>
	Why does someone stressed not always laugh when everyone else does?
</h2>
<div class="h2"><div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Emma is stressed about her final coding project and is hunched over her laptop.</narration></p>
        
     <p><narration>Something happens across the room, which makes Zoe and Owen laugh—but it just makes Emma shake her head.</narration>
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        A group that has different sizes of OK won’t react the same way to similar mistakes—since <term>relaxed</term> people will have a <term>large</term> OK, while a <em>stressed</em> person will have a <em>small</em> OK:

        Title="Flowchart of evaluations"
        alt="This flowchart has a mistake box labeled 'something across the room.' It flows to two options below: a small OK box, labeled 'we're stressed,' or an equal-sized OK-box, labeled 'we're not stressed.' Beneath these two options are a visual callback to our scales: if the flowchart ends in the scales out of balance, there won't be humor -- if thechart ends with the scales in balance, there will be humor."

    <p>
        When we're with stressed people, we'll sometimes see them feeling humor from things that seem minor to us. That’s because small mistakes can match their small OK <callback>(from being stressed)</callback>:

It flows into either a balancing small OK box, labled 'we're stressed' -- leading to humor -- or to an unbalanced larger OK box, labeled 'we're not stressed' -- which doesn't lead to humor. It's being stressed that leads to Emma's buttons generating humor."

    <p>
        When non-stressed people have a large OK, they often <sem>want</sem> to pursue large mistake activities—which can be emotionally difficult for people with small OKs: 
    </p>
    
    <div class="vignette">

        <speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Think fast, Zo!”</speech> <action>*flicks a sunflower seed at her*</action>

        <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Return fire! Fire the catapults!”</speech> <action>*loads spoon with grape*</action> <notes>(&larr;large mistakes are fun with people with large OKs)</notes>

    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(stressed)</internalaction> <speech>“Would you guys please STOP it?!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;large mistakes are stressful with people with low OKs)</notes>

        <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(earnestly)</internalaction> <speech>“Did you hear about the Fail-a-Thon event this evening? You get on stage and people watch you fail at hard things! It sounds like fun! Want to be my partner?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels this event would have a large mistake, large OK)</notes>

    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(stressed)</internalaction> <internalaction>*clutches head*</internalaction> <speech>"No! God."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels this event would have a large mistake, small OK)</notes>

        <h2>Why are taboo jokes funny to close friends, but not to strangers?</h2>
        <div class="h2">
        <div class="vignette">
        <p>
                <narration>Amaya tells Minh a taboo joke, which shocks him and makes him laugh. He wonders why it’s funny to him, since he feels most people would be disgusted by it. Like, why could she tell that joke to him, but not someone on the bus?</narration>
            </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                When we’re with close friends, we might have an OK that’s large enough to absorb big mistakes—like comments that have forbidden content. But when we’re around strangers, we often have a much smaller OK, which makes the mistake of the forbidden content oversize the OK.

<h2>Why do kids like breaking the rules?</h2>
<div class="h2">
   <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <speaker>Sam:</speaker> <speech>“While mom’s at the hospital tonight, I thought we’d break the rules a bit! How about we get pizza and eat it in front of the TV?”</speech>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Riley jumps with excitement. As they sit on the floor with pizza and watch one of her shows, she keeps saying</narration>
        “Isn’t this fun?”
    </p>
        </div>
         
    <p>
        Kids often feel humor at the things that break rules and routines, like:
    </p>
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            eating while watching videos
        </li>
        <li>
            going to sleepovers
        </li>
        <li>
            going on field trips
        </li>
        <li>
            helping bake
        </li>
        <li>
            making loud noises
        </li>
        <li>
            skipping school
        </li>
        <li>
            sleeping in a tent
        </li>
        <li>
            wearing costumes
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    </div>
    <p>
        These are large mistakes—they deviate from their expectations. Children feel humor when their guardians also cue that these mistakes are OK—and children are stressed when breaking the rules <sem>doesn’t</sem> feel OK. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Adults have a similar relationship to rules. We laugh and have fun when we feel the mistake of breaking the rules are OK. This is true for all kinds of things, like:
    </p>
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            camping
        </li>
        <li>
            clubbing
        </li>
        <li>
            eating at an expensive restaurant
        </li>
        <li>
            trying new sexual activities
        </li>
        <li>
            rioting
        </li>
        <li>
            setting things on fire
        </li>
        <li>
            shooting weapons
        </li>
        <li>
            splurging
        </li>
        <li>
            traveling
        </li>
        <li>
            using drugs
        </li>
        <li>
            watching violence
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
 
        <p>
            Like kids, when the mistake is <term>balanced</term> to our sense of security from negative personal consequences, we <term>enjoy</term> these activies—we feel humor. When the mistake is <em>unbalanced</em> with our sense of security from negative personal consequences, we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> <em>enjoy</em> these activies—we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> feel humor.
        </p>
              </div>

            <h2>Why do we sometimes laugh harder when we try to get serious?</h2>
        
            <div class="h2">
                    
        <div class="vignette">
        <p>
        <narration>Zoe, Owen, and Emma are working on a group project, but they can’t stop laughing and getting distracted. Owen wants to make progress.</narration>
            </p>
            <p>
            <speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Okay for <term>real</term>, we have to get <em>serious.</em>”</speech>
            </p> 
            <p>
            <narration>Everyone agrees and they all sober up and nod.</narration>
        </p>
        <p>
            <narration>Owen flips open his textbook, which causes Emma and Zoe to burst into laughter.</narration>
        </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Sometimes, too much effort to “get serious” can cause what it tries to prevent. By shrinking the OK, we'll feel humor at small mistakes&mdash;like flipping open a textbook. 
        </p>
</div>
<!--
	<p>
		We sometimes try really hard to prevent humor—like to win a no-smiling contest, to run a somber tabletop roleplaying scene, to respectfully listen, and so on. The easiest way to prevent breaking out into a smile is to worry less about <sem>eliminating</sem> humor. This gives our evaluations a sizing that doesn't find small mistakes funny.</p>
