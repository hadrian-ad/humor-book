    <p>In this chapter, we’ll be looking at the <term>intensity</term> of humor: why we sometimes feel a large amount of humor, and other times a small amount of humor:</p>

    <p>
    Why is humor sometimes high-intensity, and other times low-intensity? To talk about this, we’ll see mistakes and OKs as having a <term>size</term> to them.</p>

   alt="This image visualizes the 'size' of mistakes and oks. Small mistakes and OKs are shown as small boxes, large mistakes and OKs are shown as large boxes.">
    
<p>
    The intensity of humor depends on the size of mistakes and OKs. We’ll be talking about how this works throughout the rest of this chapter.
