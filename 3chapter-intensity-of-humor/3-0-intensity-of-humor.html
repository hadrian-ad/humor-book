    <p>
    Why is humor sometimes high-intensity, and other times low-intensity?</p> 
    
    <p>To talk about this, we’ll see mistakes and OKs as having a <vocab>size</vocab> to them. The intensity of humor depends on the relative size of these evaluations. </p>

   alt="This image visualizes the size of mistakes and OKs. Small mistakes and OKs are shown as small boxes, large mistakes and OKs are shown as large boxes.">

We’ll be talking about how this works throughout the rest of this chapter.
