    Examples of balanced mistakes and OKs
</h1>
  

<p>
	When the size of mistakes and OKs balance, we feel <term>high-intensity</term> humor. When the sizes <outcome-contrast>don’t</outcome-contrast> balance, we feel <em>low-intensity</em> humor:

            Emma laughed when something similar happened to her in her <term>life</term> <callback>(two dogs instead of one)</callback>, since her mistake and OK balanced. But when it happened in a <em>movie</em>, her OK was too large and her mistake too small for her to feel much humor.

                <strong>Mistake.</strong> Emma was led to expect one thing would happen <callback>(there would be just twins)</callback>, but something else happened <callback>(there was a huge family)</callback>&mdash;so what happened deviated from her expectations. The size of this mistake <callback>(large)</callback> was cued to Emma by the overly-dramatic acting, camera work, editing, music, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>OK.</strong> Emma saw this as having a large OK because she knows it’s just a movie. Since it’s surreal, there’s no risk of personal consequences to her at all. The movie encouraged the size of this OK <callback>(large)</callback> through the acting, franchise, genre, zaniness, and so on.
