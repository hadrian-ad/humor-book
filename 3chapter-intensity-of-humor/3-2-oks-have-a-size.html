    OKs have a size
</h1>
 <!--   03.20-->
  
<p>We also evaluate the size of the OK, similar to how we measured a mistake.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">A more precise word for "<a href="../2chapter-defining-humor/2-2-what-do-we-mean-by-ok.html">OK</a>" is <callback>secure from negative personal consequences</callback>. The <term>more</term> secure we feel from negative personal consequences, the <term>larger</term> our OK. The <em>less</em> secure we feel from negative personal consequences, the <em>smaller</em> our OK.</p>

<p>Like mistakes, we can intuitively sort comparable situations by the magnitude of their OK: </p>

<p>By itself, the size of someone’s OK doesn’t tell us much about the intensity of humor.</p>
    <div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
            <p class="for-instance-text">If we’re very wealthy, we’d have a large OK when pay for parking&mdash;but that doesn’t mean we’d feel high-intensity humor every time we spend some money on parking.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>The intensity of humor is determined by the comparative size of <sem>both</sem> the mistake and OK. We’ll be talking about this next. </p>

<div class="box"><p><headline>Self-reference.</headline> We use <sem-weak>ourselves</sem-weak> as the reference point when thinking about the size of our OK. Our OK isn't a measure of our perception of <term>general</term> consequences&mdash;it's a measure of our perception of <em>personal</em> consequences.</p>

<p>When someone describes an accidental injury that happened at their work, we may have a large OK. This doesn't mean we see this injury as good&mdash;it just means we <sem>personally</sem> feel secure from negative consequences. We're the reference point for the OK. </p>

<p>Sometimes we identify so much with someone else that risk of negative consequences to <term>them</term> feels like risk of negative consequences to <em>us</em>. That's why our OK would become much smaller if we realize the accident at work happened to our sibling, and not to a stranger.</p>

<p>But even in this case, we’d still be using <sem-weak>ourselves</sem-weak> as the reference point for how secure we feel from negative personal consequences. </p>
