    OKs have a size
</h2>
 <!--   03.20-->
  
<p>We also evaluate the size of the OK, similar to how we measured a mistake.</p>

        <p>A more precise word for "<a href="../2chapter-defining-humor/2-2-what-do-we-mean-by-ok.html">OK</a>" is <callback>secure from negative personal consequences</callback>. The <term>more</term> secure we feel from negative personal consequences, the <term>larger</term> our OK. The <term2>less</term2> secure we feel from negative personal consequences, the <term2>smaller</term2> our OK.</p>

<p>Like mistakes, we can intuitively sort comparable situations by the magnitude of their OK: </p>

<p>By itself, the size of someone’s OK doesn’t tell us much about the intensity of humor.</p>
    <div class="for-instance">
       <aside class="consider">
             <!--<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>-->
                <p>If we’re very wealthy, we’d have a large OK when pay for parking&mdash;but that doesn’t mean we’d feel high-intensity humor every time we spend some money on parking.</p>
        </aside>
    </div>
    
<p>The intensity of humor is determined by the comparative size of <em>both</em> the mistake and OK. We’ll be talking about this next. </p>

<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Self-reference.</headline> We use <sem-weak>ourselves</sem-weak> as the reference point when thinking about the size of our OK. Our OK isn't a measure of our perception of <term>general</term> consequences&mdash;it's a measure of our perception of <term2>personal</term2> consequences.</p>
    
    <p>When someone describes an accidental injury that happened at their work, we may have a large OK. This doesn't mean we see this injury as good&mdash;it just means we <em>personally</em> feel secure from negative consequences. We're the reference point for the OK. </p>
    
    <p>Sometimes we identify so much with someone else that risk of negative consequences to <term>them</term> feels like risk of negative consequences to <term2>us</term2>. That's why our OK would become much smaller if we realize the accident at work happened to our sibling, and not to a stranger.</p>
    
    <p>But even in this case, we’d still be using <sem-weak>ourselves</sem-weak> as the reference point for how secure we feel from negative personal consequences. </p>
