    Humor is most intense when mistakes and OKs balance
</h2>
<!--   03.30-->

<p>
	To model the intensity of humor, we compare the sizes of mistakes and OKs together. When the sizes of the mistake and OK are <vocab>balanced</vocab>, we feel intense humor. 
</p>
<p>
	In other words, we feel humor most intensely when the sizes of the mistake and OK are closest to 1:1&mdash;when the two sizes are proportional to each other.

	We can represent this visually. When the mistakes and OKs are balanced&mdash;are 1:1&mdash;we feel intense humor:

    title="Proportional mistakes and OK generate intense humor"
    alt="This image shows four scales, with mistakes visualized as boxes on the left balance, and OKs visualized as boxes on the right balance. When the scales are balanced (large and large or small and small) the intensity of humor is highest. Whet the scales aren't balanced (one large and one small) there's low-intensity humor."

<p>
	When the size of mistake and OK balance, we feel intense humor.

    <aside class="box">
        <p><headline>Cheering.</headline> To think about how balanced sizes lead to intense humor, we can make an analogy to watching scored sports: the closer the scores of both teams, the greater our emotional intensity. </p>
        
                <p>It doesn’t matter if the scores are both <term>low</term> or both <term>high</term>&mdash;as long as they’re both <term2>close</term2>, we’re on the edge of our seats, laughing, anxious, yelling at the screen, and so on. 
                
                <p>By contrast, if one team’s score is crushingly larger relative to the other, we’re not always feeling emotions as animatedly. Whether we're miserable or content, we're not <sem-weak>captivated</sem-weak> the way we'd be if scores were balanced.</p>
            
        <p>This is similar to how mistakes and OKs interact. When the size of the mistake and OK are close to 1:1, we feel intense humor&mdash;whether both large or both small. When they’re <em>not</em> close to 1:1, we feel something other than intense humor.</p>
