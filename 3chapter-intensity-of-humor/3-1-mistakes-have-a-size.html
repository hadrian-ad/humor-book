    Mistakes have a size

    <p>
    When we evaluate something as a mistake, we also evaluate the <vocab>size</vocab> of that mistake.

            <p class="considertext"> We talked before about how a more precise word for “<a href="../1chapter-defining-humor/1-1-what-do-we-mean-by-mistake.html">mistake</a>” is deviation from the expected. We have baseline expectations—the size of the mistake is <sem>how much</sem> something deviates from those expectations.</p></div>
    <p>
    We have an intuitive ability sort comparable mistakes by their magnitude—by their "size:"

            By itself, the size of a mistake doesn't tell us about the intensity of humor. If Stephen accidentally runs over his neighbor, it would be a large mistake&mdash;but that doesn't mean he would feel intense humor!
    </p>
    
    <p>To predict the intensity of humor we'll also need to think about the size of the OK. We'll look at this next!</p>


    <div class="box">
<p><headline>Good and bad.</headline> The size of a mistake doesn't have anything to do with "good" or "bad." It just has to do with <sem-weak>how much</sem-weak> something deviates from our expectations.</p>

<p>If we see a squirrel hop in a way we've never seen before, we don't need to think about good or bad&mdash;we just need to think about how much it against our expectations.</p>
  
<p>In the same way, when Zoe gets a grade she isn't expecting, we don't need to think about good or bad&mdash;we just need to think about how much it deviated from what she was expecting.</p>
   
<p>The mistake is only related to unexpectedness. Both a low grade and a high grade can lead can lead to the same size mistake. It's not because they're equally good and bad. It's because they equally deviate from our expectations.</p>
