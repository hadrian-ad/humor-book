    Mistakes have a size
</h1>
  <!--   03.10-->

    <p>
    When we evaluate something as a mistake, we also evaluate the <term>size</term> of that mistake.
    </p> 
<div class="consider">
           <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            <p class="considertext"> We talked before about how a more precise word for “<a href="../1chapter-defining-humor/1-1-what-do-we-mean-by-mistake.html">mistake</a>” is <term>deviation from the expected.</term> We have baseline expectations—the size of the mistake is <em>how much</em> something deviates from those expectations.</p></div>
    <p>
    We have an intuitive ability sort comparable mistakes by their magnitude—by their "size:"

            All these expectations and evaluations are subjective. While Zoe may expect to get full points, her expectations are informal&mdash;they aren't necessarily accurate to her past experiences or even her thoughtful opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
            By itself, the size of a mistake doesn't tell us about the intensity of humor.
        </p>
    
<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">If Stephen accidentally runs over his neighbor, it would be a large mistake&mdash;but that doesn't mean he would feel intense humor!
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>To predict the intensity of humor we'll also need to think about the size of the OK. We'll look at this next!</p>

    
    <button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Mistakes are agnostic to good and bad</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">
<p>At first, it might seem that "good" and "bad" matter to the size of a mistake&mdash;but they don't. The size of a mistake is just how much something deviates from our expectations.</p>
<p>So if Zoe gets a 50% or a 150% on her essay, it doesn't matter if Zoe thinks one mistake is unexpectedly bad and the other unexpectedly good. The size of mistake is just how   unexpected something is.</p>
