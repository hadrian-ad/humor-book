    Mistakes have a size
</h2>
  <!--   03.10-->

    <p>
    When we evaluate something as a mistake, we also evaluate the <vocab>size</vocab> of that mistake.

    We have an intuitive ability sort comparable mistakes by their magnitude&mdash;by their "size:"

            By itself, the size of a mistake doesn't tell us about the intensity of humor. If Stephen accidentally runs over his neighbor, it would be a large <term>mistake</term>&mdash;but that doesn't mean he would feel intense <term2>humor</term2>!
    </p>
    
    <p>To predict the intensity of humor, we'll <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> need to think about the size of the OK.</p>


    <aside class="box">
        <p><headline>Good and bad.</headline> The size of a mistake doesn't have anything to do with "good" or "bad." It just has to do with <sem-weak>how much</sem-weak> something deviates from our expectations.</p>
        
        <p>If we see a squirrel hop in a way we've never seen before, we don't need to think with words like "good" or "bad"&mdash;we just need to think about how much it goes against our expectations.</p>
          
        <p>In the same way, when Zoe gets a grade she isn't expecting, we don't need to think with words like "good" or "bad"&mdash;we just need to think about how much it deviated from what she was expecting.</p>
           
        <p>The mistake is <sem-weak>only</sem-weak> related to unexpectedness. Both a <term>low</term> grade and a <term2>high</term2> grade can lead can <em>both</em> have the same size mistake&mdash;not because they're equally good or equally bad, but because they're equally unexpected.</p>
