Humor outcomes can describe the absence of humor

<p>Above, Minh and Owen feel humor at the <term>same</term> thing for <term2>different</term2> reasons.

<div class="consider">
        <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
         <p>At base, humor outcomes are narrative descriptions of mistakes and OKs balancing. So Owen won't feel <sem-weak>any</sem-weak> empathetic poster <humor-outcome>creates rapport</humor-outcome>, just because it's empathetic&mdash;he only <humor-outcome>feels rapport</humor-outcome> if his mistakes and OKs balance.</p>
         
         <p>If university hallways are usually sterile and cold, empathetic posters from fellow students will both deviate from his expectations <callback>(mistake)</callback> at the same time he feels secure from negative personal consequences <callback>(OK)</callback>.</p>
         
             
           <p>By contrast, if Owen walks through a kindergarten every day, he'll <em>expect</em> empathetic posters <callback>(small mistake)</callback>&mdash;and he'll feel posters for young children have little negative  consequence to him <callback>(large OK)</callback>.</p> 
           
           <p>In this case, Owen <outcome-contrast>won't</outcome-contrast> feel an empathetic poster in a kindergarten <humor-outcome>creates rapport</humor-outcome>, simply because it's empathetic.</p>

    <p>At this point, we’ve gone over the five interchangeable ways we’ll be describing humor in this book.</p> 
    
    <p>These are different scales of looking at humor&mdash;from the <term>highest</term> scale <callback>(the general word “humor”)</callback> to the <term2>smallest</term2> scale <callback>(“mistakes and OKs”)</callback>:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Humor as an overall pattern <callback>(“humor”)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as experiences <callback>(humor family words)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as actions, intentions, or consequences <callback>(humor outcomes)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as expressive behavior <callback>(humor tells)</callback></li>
    <li>Humor as information-assessments <callback>(mistakes and OKs)</callback></li>
    </ul>
    
         <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-0-pyramid.png

    alt="This pyramid is divided into five sections. At top is humor (overall pattern), then humor family words (situation  or states), humor outcomes (actions), humor tells (behavior) and finally mistakes and OKs (assessments)";
    title="Assembly of humor";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

 
<p>These are all different scales of talking about the same thing.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
     <p> We pick a scale or scales to focus on based on what's useful to us. Sometimes we want to pull back for a bigger picture view, and other times we want to zoom in for smaller details.</p>
</div>

<p>To think about this scale, we can see how these all compose each other. For instance, when humor tells occur in combination, they compose a humor outcome&mdash;like how <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>relaxed posture</humor-tell> compose <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>:</p>

      <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-1-tells-into-outcomes.png

    alt="This molecule figure has three humor tell dots: loosening, social integration, and relaxed posture. They are arranged into a triangle with the dots as points, forming a humor outcome 'ease tension'";
    title="Molecule figure";
    style="max-width: 22rem; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>Similarly, when humor outcomes occur in combination, they compose a humor family word&mdash;like how <humor-outcome>eased tensions</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>survival of a high stress environment</humor-outcome>, and <humor-outcome>changing negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome> compose <emotions>relief</emotions>:</p>

     <img src=../images/closer-look/cl-scales-of-humor/cl-scales-2-outcomes-into-family-word.png

    alt="This molecule figure has three humor outcomes, represented by the triangle figure of compounded humor tells, forming an even larger triangle of a humor family word. In this way, negative emotions changed into positive ones, easing tensions, surviving a high stress environment, all compound into a 'relief' molecule.";
    title="Molecule figure II";
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
     

<p>This is why any of our examples can be annotated with any combination of mistakes and OKs, humor tells, humor outcomes, humor family words, or the word humor:</p>

    <p>These are all different ways of describing humor! Throughout this book, we’ll be choosing among these options based on what we think would be helpful to growing our intuitive understanding of things. And sometimes, we’ll use multiple scales of humor for a greater range of perspective.</p>
