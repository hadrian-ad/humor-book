Contextualizing humor outcomes</h2>  

    <p>We can be more specific about what's happening by linking a humor outcome to a topic.</p>
     
                 <div class="for-instance">
     <consider>For instance:</consider> 
       <p>Even though <humor-outcome>handle criticism</humor-outcome> is a humor outcome, it's not always useful to say someone handles <term>general</term> criticisms about <term>everything</term>&mdash;we can instead say they handle a <term2>specific</term2> criticism about <term2>something</term2>. </p>
       </div> 
      
<p>We can clarify humor outcomes with details whenever we think it would be useful:</p>
  
   <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>If On a Winter’s Night a Traveler</book-title>. She pauses and then smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels she <humor-outcome>handled criticism</humor-outcome> <outcome-contrast>she had about the title</outcome-contrast>)</notes></p>
    </div>


   <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title>. She pauses and then smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels the title <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome> <outcome-contrast>about what the book will be like</outcome-contrast>)</notes></p>
    </div>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Cryptonomicon</book-title>. She pauses and then smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels title <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome> <outcome-contrast>by influencing how she spent her attention</outcome-contrast>)</notes></p>

    <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal?</book-title> She pauses and then smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels the title <humor-outcome>eased tension</humor-outcome> <outcome-contrast>about how she relates to herself</outcome-contrast>)</notes></p>
    </div> 
    
        
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948</book-title>. She pauses and then smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe felt an <humor-outcome>argument was supported</humor-outcome> <outcome-contrast>about the intellectual life of post-war Berlin</outcome-contrast>)</notes></p>
        </div> 


 <div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>The Big Book of Masturbation: From Angst to Zeal</book-title>. She pauses and then smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome> <outcome-contrast>on how one could discuss a specific topic</outcome-contrast>)</notes></p>
   
    </div> 

    <p>We don't have to limit ourselves to just one clarification&mdash;when Zoe encounters <book-title>The Big Book of Masturbation: From Angst to Zeal</book-title>, she might <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome> on:</p>
 
<ul class="close-list">
     <li>masturbation</li>
      <li>how others think of masturbation</li>
      <li>approaches to discussing masturbation</li>
      <li>her history to the subject</li>
      <li>what the book may be like</li>
      <li>how books can be titled</li>
      <li>how well "Angst to Zeal" fits an "A to Z" format</li>
      <li>how she's currently spending her time in the book store</li>
      <li>what she does and doesn't want to read about</li>
      <li>the frequency or infrequency she's encountered books on this topic</li>
      </ul>  
  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>We can use as many of these as we think would be useful or accurate&mdash;each one helps us look for what <i>deviated from her expectations</i> <callback>(mistake)</callback> in a way that balanced with her <i>sense of personal security from negative consequences</i> <callback>(OK)</callback>.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>As before, we can use as many humor outcomes as we like. Zoe may not just <humor-outcome>gain a new perspective</humor-outcome>, but also feel <humor-outcome>taboo topics were dealt with</humor-outcome>:</p>

                alt="This mesh figure for 'Big Book of Masturbation' connects 'Zoe smiles' to many humor outcomes, including gained a new perspective, dealt with taboo topics, eased tension, supported an argument, and created rapport.";

        <p>...we can also look at <term2>why</term2> and <term2>how</term2> Zoe felt an <humor-outcome>argument was supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>tensions were eased</humor-outcome>, and so on. </p>
</div>
  

   <!--When we laugh at a book title, we sometimes want to explain our humor by describing the title. <callback>("It's a joke," "it's satirical," and so on.)</callback> But this isn't a precise or reliable way of explaining humor.</p> 
    
       <p>Simply being a joke doesn't explain the presence or absence of humor&mdash;different people laugh at them or not in different situations. And this is still true for not-exactly-joke things like <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title> and <book-title>In a Cold Crater: Intellectual Life in Berlin, 1945-1948</book-title>.</p>
    -->
     
          <aside class="box">
                <p> <headline>Explaining.</headline> Zoe doesn't always feel humor when she hears a joke or reads a title. But she <em>does</em> always feel humor when she <humor-outcome>gains a new perspective</humor-outcome>&mdash;otherwise she wouldn't have <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>.</p> 
                        
                <p>This means we get best explain Zoe's humor by looking for her new perspective&mdash;and once we do that, it doesn't even matter whether we classify a title as one thing or another. <callback>("It's a joke," "it's satirical," or so on.)</callback> </p>

    <p>We can assign humor outcomes by working backwards. We can pick a humor outcome and ask: in what way does this humor outcome apply? <callback>("In what way does Zoe <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome> when she smiles at <book-title>Handy Andy</book-title>?")</callback></p>

<p>Evaluations are ties from people to the world around them. Humor is a relational expression of these ties.

    <p>We can use humor outcomes to pull apart this complexity. By thinking about how they relate to moments of humor,

    <p>We can see the same thing with Justin and Heather.</p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Justin and Heather go biking through the cemetery every weekend. They often stop to ponder and enjoy a chipper sign that says</narration> <speech>“Cremation? Do we have a place FOR YOU!”</speech></p>

    <p>Above, Justin wants to describe something with genre words&mdash;all of which sometimes generate humor, and sometimes don't. But it's not "tone deaf" that makes Heather laugh&mdash;the actual evaluatory action happening is <humor-outcome>rapport being created</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>taboo topics being dealt with</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new topics of conversation being opened</humor-outcome>, and so on. This directly explains the humor, instead of just describing an object.</p>

 <p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain a family's humor. They didn't expect to see a sign like this <callback>(a mistake)</callback>, and it didn't have personal consequences for them <callback>(it's OK)</callback>.</p>
 
 <p>This would be a pretty shallow place to stop. So to dig deeper, we can use our list of humor outcomes. How would some humor outcomes apply, even in poetic or non-standard ways?</p>
 
 <p>By using humor outcomes, we can ask specific questions, like: in what way is their humor showing that something was <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>rapport was created</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>tensions were eased</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>new perspectives were found</humor-outcome>, that a <humor-outcome>personality trait was revealed</humor-outcome>, that <humor-outcome>close ties were symbolized?</humor-outcome></p>
 
<p>By answering these questions, we can spark personal insight into some of the actions happening in the emotional situation.</p>

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to explain why Zoe and Emma felt humor. <callback>("The poster deviated from Zoe's expectations, and she felt equally secure from negative personal consequences.")</callback></p>

<p>At the same time, this generic language can obscure aspects of the emotional situation that we intuitively feel is happening. To cast a net for these aspects, we can use humor outcomes.</p>

<p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma's humor <humor-outcome>created rapport (among themselves, with the sign, with the establishment, and so on)</humor-outcome>; <humor-outcome>gave a new perspective (by inverting a meanginful idiom)</humor-outcome>; the sign's design, location, mood, sentiment, tone, vibe, and so on <humor-outcome>reveals a personal view (of the artist, establishment, or viewer)</humor-outcome>; and so on.</p>

    <p>We don't need to describe the genre or tone of Obama's statement <callback>("was it a joke? Satire? Mocking? Teasing? Biting? Clever?")</callback> to think about why the audience laughed.</p> 
    
    <p>Instead, we can simply say the audience laughed because they felt Obama <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave new perspective</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieved catharsis</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This lets us understand the relation between the statement and the audience in a way that explains humor&mdash;without getting bogged down in trying to categorize speech.</p> 
    
<p>Obama went on in a way that some people thought was mean-spirited:</p> 

    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-IW6PwJYcOc?si=clNGfdAfVlSU1UuO&amp;start=335&amp;end=350" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines." <internalaction>(regaining composure)</internalaction>  "And so the question is not a game of Battleship where we're counting ships. It's what are our capabilities."</speech></p></div>
    
<p>Let's say someone thought this was mean, not funny. What was different here than moments before?</p>

<p>Again, we can use humor outcomes. Someone who thought Obama went too far thought he didn't <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized</humor-outcome>, didn't <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, but <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>undermined</outcome-contrast> an argument</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
  
<p>As before, <em>how</em> we describe the comment doesn't matter <callback>(mocking, arguing, teasing, angry, joking, and so on)</callback> since those words are outcome nonspecific&mdash;they don't by themselves indicate who would or wouldn't laugh in a given situation. So we can instead start by simply saying that some viewers didn't feel they reached any humor outcomes&mdash;and so they didn't feel humor.</p>
