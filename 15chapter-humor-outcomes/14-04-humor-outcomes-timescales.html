Humor outcomes can describe periods of time
</h2>
     
<p>We can use humor outcomes to describe <term>individual</term> moments of humor. But we can also use humor outcomes to describe <em>overall</em> experiences of humor:

<p>Without knowing anything specifically that was said, we can still describe the overall experience with humor outcomes: throughout the lunch period, Lina and Xiaowei were trying to <humor-outcome>help Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>.</p> 

<p>And since Damien felt humor, Lina and Xiaowei were successful in getting Damien to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>,  <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mdash;Damien <humor-outcome>became accepted</humor-outcome>.</p>

    <p><headline>Scale.</headline> Sometimes we think of humor as something that primarily has to do with sentences&mdash;and so to discover why someone felt humor, we'd have to have a transcript. But this granular approach can be like thinking we have to look at each tree before we can say there's a forest.</p>
    
    <p>We can use humor outcomes to talk about the <sem-weak>collective</sem-weak> humor that happened over a general period of time. Lina and Xiaowei <humor-outcome>helped Damien become accepted</humor-outcome>&mdash;a process that produces humor.</p> 
        
    <p>We can say this without knowing any specifics about what they talked about&mdash;it's enough to know the gist of what was happening over a period of twenty minutes.
