<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Our humor bush is our opinion of something</h1>

<p>If Emma says she has a high opinion of Seattle, her good opinion is based on her humor bush with Seattle:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“I went to Seattle last summer! I <sem-weak>love</sem-weak> Seattle!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s opinion of Seattle)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <speech>“I <sem-weak>lived</sem-weak> there for eighteen years. I… like it.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh’s opinion of Seattle)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Well I <sem-weak>hate</sem-weak> Seattle.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s opinion of Seattle)</notes> <speech>“I was trapped in a Greyhound station there for like twelve hours overnight once. One of the worst experiences of my life!”</speech></p>

<p>When Emma says she loves Seattle, and Owen says he hates it, they’re not arguing about the merits of Seattle’s:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>strong mayoral system</li>
    <li>growth opportunities in their retail market</li>
    <li>economic data of the middle quintile of residents</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>Instead, Emma loves how she <sem-weak>feels</sem-weak> about Seattle—just like Owen hates how he <sem-weak>feels</sem-weak> about Seattle. They’re both describing their humor bush with Seattle.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When Emma visited Seattle, she felt she <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> created rapport (with herself or the city)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> gained new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>constantly</outcome-contrast> avoided conflict (with herself or others while travelling)</humor-outcome>, felt <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> able to become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>constantly</outcome-contrast> symbolized close ties (with herself, the city, the world)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">By contrast, Owen felt he <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> created rapport (with himself or the city)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> gained new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>couldn’t</outcome-contrast> avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> symbolized close ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
</div>

 

<p>Emma visited Seattle for a <term>vacation</term>—it was a short time period that was filled with interesting and novel experiences. This gave her a large humor bush.</p>



<p>By contrast, Minh <em>lived</em> there&mdash;it was a long time period that was filled with less straightforwardly enjoyable things. This gives Minh a smaller overall humor bush than Emma:
    </p>

<p>Since Minh’s humor bush with Seattle is smaller than Emma, his opinion of the city is smaller than Emma's opinion—but not as low as Owen’s opinion.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Dilution.</headline> Emma has one topic 'Seattle,' which she attributes all humor to&mdash;this supercharges her humor bush with 'Seattle.'</p>
    
    <p>By contrast, Minh has many active topics he uses instead of Seattle&mdash;he attributes humor to his neighborhood, his home, his school, a specific shop, and so on. This dilutes his humor across many topics, instead of all being attributed to 'Seattle.'</p>

    <p>Minh may have a large humor bush with his home street in Seattle&mdash;and his face may light up when it's mentioned. But unlike Emma, he won't neccessarily attribute this localized humor with the abstract city 'Seattle' itself.</p>
