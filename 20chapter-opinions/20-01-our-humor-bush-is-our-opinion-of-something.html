<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Our humor bush is our opinion of something</h1>



<p>If Emma says she has a high opinion of Seattle, her good opinion is based on her humor bush with Seattle:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“I went to Seattle last summer! I <sem-weak>love</sem-weak> Seattle!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma’s opinion of Seattle)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <speech>“I <sem-weak>lived</sem-weak> there for eighteen years. I… like it.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh’s opinion of Seattle)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Well I <sem-weak>hate</sem-weak> Seattle.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen’s opinion of Seattle)</notes> <speech>“I was trapped in a Greyhound station there for like twelve hours overnight once. One of the worst experiences of my life!”</speech></p>

<p>When Emma says she loves Seattle, and Owen says he hates it, they’re not arguing about Seattle’s:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>strong mayoral system</li>
    <li>growth opportunities in their retail market</li>
    <li>economic data of the middle quintile of residents</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>Instead, Emma loves how she <sem-weak>feels</sem-weak> about Seattle—just like Owen hates how he <sem-weak>feels</sem-weak> about Seattle. They’re both describing their humor bush with Seattle.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When Emma visited Seattle, she felt she <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> created rapport (with herself or the city)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> gained new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>constantly</outcome-contrast> avoided conflict (with herself or others while travelling)</humor-outcome>, felt <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> able to become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>constantly</outcome-contrast> symbolized close ties (with herself, the city, the world)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">By contrast, Owen felt he <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> created rapport (with himself or the city)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> gained new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>couldn’t</outcome-contrast> avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> symbolized close ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<p>Emma visited Seattle for a vacation—it was a short time period that was filled with interesting and novel experiences. This gave her a large humor bush.</p>



<p>By contrast, Minh lived there, so his experiences also included less straightforwardly enjoyable things. This gives Minh a smaller overall humor bush than Emma:

<p>Since Minh’s humor bush with Seattle is smaller than Emma, his opinion of the city is smaller than Emma's opinion—but not as low as Owen’s opinion.</p>

 

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><headline>Dilution.</headline> When Minh thinks about <callback>"Seattle,"</callback> he has many active topics active—he thinks about his neighborhood, his home, his school, a specific shop, and so on. So if he averages “10” units of humor a day in Seattle, he’ll distribute these units over many topics.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>But when Emma visits, she doesn't distinguish between ‘Redmond’ and ‘Bellevue’—instead, she lumps everything as ‘Seattle.’ So if she averages “10” units of humor a day in Seattle, it all gets loaded into one topic of Seattle, which gives her a larger humor bush toward ‘Seattle’ than Minh does—even if they feel relatively similar amounts of humor:</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: " 
     >

    
    <p>Similarly, even if Minh has a large humor bush with a neighborhood in Seattle, that doesn't mean he'll associate this humor with the abstract city 'Seattle' itself.</p>
