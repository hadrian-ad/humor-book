<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>




<p>Usually, when we give an opinion of something, there are two parts: our evaluation of the humor bush (our overall opinion), and our assessment of its relation to a particular goal: </p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>Emma: “How was the Tennis for Beginners event? Should I do it?”</p>
    
    <p>Zoe: *smiles* “I didn’t learn much about tennis, but it was kind of fun.” (&larr;Zoe recalls something with a favorable opinion, even though she qualifies its relation to a specific goal)</p>
    </div> 
    
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Zoe: “You took Cod: The Rise of the International Fish with Professor Schmidt, right? Worth it?”</p>
    
    <p>Owen: *smiles* “I love Professor Schmidt! That course was way more interesting than it had any right to be. Don’t know when I’ll use that knowledge, but now I know all about Basque fishermen.” (&larr;Owen recalls a class with a favorable opinion, even though he qualifies its relation to a specific goal)</p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Dave: “What did you think of Chairs?”</p>
    
    <p>Justin: “Honestly, it was pretty dry. Tremendous scholarship though, just tremendous.” (&larr;Justin recalls something with an unfavorable opinion, even though he qualifies its relation to a specific goal)</p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Justin is reading evaluations.</p>
    
    <p>Anonymous: “I liked the course but we spent too much on Browning honestly” (&larr;someone recalls a course with a favorable opinion, even though they qualify an exception they tie to content)</p>
    
    </div>

<p>If we feel fitted humor toward something, we’ll think of it positively—but that’s different than seeing it as effective toward a particular goal.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Kids movies.</headline> If we loved a movie as kids, we’ll have a good opinion of it as an adult—we still have a large humor bush with it, and smile when we think about it. If someone tells us it wasn’t very good and that there are better kids movies available today, we’d probably agree—but our overall opinion is of our humor bush with the movie, not a technical comparison.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>Similarly, if Zoe prefers Pittsburgh to Seattle, and Emma points out that Pittsburgh is poorer and smaller that Seattle, Zoe would probably agree—but her overall opinion is of her humor bush with Pittsburgh. Comparative metrics about wealth or size has nothing to do with her overall opinion, which is based on how often and intensely she feels humor family words.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>We see this split all the time. Someone will bring up a comparable metric (movie quality, wealth), but these comparisons aren’t always relevant to our overall opinion of something. Sometimes someone thinks our opinion should be based on comparative quality or wealth, but functionally, it’s not—our opinion is based on humor.</p>
