<h1 id="exclude-navigation">An overall opinion isn't goal-oriented</h1>

<!--
<p>Just because we have a good <term>overall</term> opinion of something doesn't mean we can't <em>also</em> judge it's relation toward different goals. We'll call these <vocab>goal-relations</vocab>.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're trying out recipes, we may enjoy the experience of cooking and eating a meal. <callback>(Overall opinion)</callback> But then we also think about whether it's worth the time, fits in our budget, meets our dietary goals, how well it transports or freezes, and so on. <callback>(Goal-relations.)</callback></p>
    
     <p class="for-instance-text">Sometimes we care so much about a goal, that a single goal-relation dominates our overall opinion of an experience. But most time, no single goal-relation determines overall opinion.</p>
</div> 
-->

<p>Our spoken opinions usually have two parts to them. One is an overall opinion of the experience. Another is a <vocab>metric comparison</vocab>&mdash;comparing one metric to another:</p>

<p>We're often so used to making metric comparisons that we sometimes confuse them with our overall opinion&mdash;but they may or may not overlap, especially since there are many different metric comparisons we could make.  </p>

<p>If we feel fitted humor toward something, we’ll think of it positively&mdash;which doesn't mean we see it comparing well in every possible comparison.</p>
 


 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Kids movies.</headline> As kids, we grew humor bushes with the movies we watched over and over. We had a good opinion of them! Since the humor bush often continues into our adult lives, we continue having a positive opinion of those movies.</p> 
    
    <p>What happens if someone tells us those movies were low-quality compared to even movies at the time, and definitely low-quality compared to kids movies today? <callback>(Metric comparisons&mdash;movies then compared to movies now.)</callback> We’d probably agree—but agreeing with a metric comparison <sem-weak>isn't</sem-weak> relevant to our overall opinion. Our overall opinion is a humor bush, which may or may not overlap with various metric comparisons.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>Similarly, if Zoe prefers Pittsburgh to Seattle, and Emma points out that Pittsburgh is poorer and smaller that Seattle <callback>(metric comparisons&mdash;a city's wealth and population compared to another's)</callback>, Zoe would agree—but her overall opinion of Pittsburgh is her humor bush. <term>Comparative metrics</term> about wealth or size has nothing to do with her <em>overall opinion</em>, which is based on how often and intensely she feels humor family words on the topic of 'Pittsburgh.'</p>
    
    <p>We see people interchange opinions with metric comparisons all the time. <callback>"You should be happier now (overall opinion) because you're making more money now (metric comparison)."</callback> But this is often like treating different units as interchangable&mdash;leading to disconnected statements.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
        <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think our opinion <sem-weak>should</sem-weak> be based on metric comparisons, like comparative quality or comparative wealth. In this view, we'd think that everyone, everywhere, should prefer Seattle to Pittsburgh because of a select few comparative qualities.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">Setting aside whether that's aspirational or not, that's not functionally how we form opinions. Our opinions come from our cumulative amount of humor we feel with things, due to our emotional orientation to fitted humor.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">This creates a fundamental starting point for thinking about opinions and the relevance of metric comparisons.</p>
