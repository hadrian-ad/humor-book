<h1 id="exclude-navigation">A good opinion does not mean something was helpful toward a goal</h1>


<p>Usually, when we give an opinion of something, there are two parts: there's the evaluation of our humor bush, which is our overall opinion. But there's also usually a <vocab>metric comparison</vocab> too, which relates an experience to some goal or priority.</p>

<p>If we feel fitted humor toward something, we’ll think of it positively—but that’s different than seeing it as effective toward a particular goal.</p>
 


 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Kids movies.</headline> If we loved a movie as kids, we’ll have a good opinion of it as an adult. We'll smile when we think of it—because we still have a large humor bush with it.</p> 
    
    <p>If someone tells us it wasn’t very good and that there are better kids movies available today <callback>(metric comparisons)</callback>, we’d probably agree—but our overall <sem>opinion</sem> is of our humor bush with the movie, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> a metric comparison. In that sense, current movies are neither here nor there to our opinion.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>Similarly, if Zoe prefers Pittsburgh to Seattle, and Emma points out that Pittsburgh is poorer and smaller that Seattle <callback>(metric comparisons)</callback>, Zoe would probably agree—but her overall opinion of Pittsburgh is her humor bush. Comparative metrics about wealth or size has nothing to do with her overall <sem>opinion</sem>, which is based on how often and intensely she feels humor family words on the topic of 'Pittsburgh.'</p>
    
    <p>We see this split all the time. Someone will bring up a comparable metric <callback>(movie quality, wealth)</callback>, but these comparisons aren’t always relevant to our overall opinion of something.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
        <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think our opinion <sem-weak>should</sem-weak> be based on metric comparisons, like comparative quality or comparative wealth. In this view, we'd think that everyone, everywhere, should prefer Seattle to Pittsburgh because of a few comparative qualities.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">Setting aside whether that's aspirational or not, we can start by noticing that, functionally, that's not how we make opinions. Our opinions come from our collective humor with things.</p>
