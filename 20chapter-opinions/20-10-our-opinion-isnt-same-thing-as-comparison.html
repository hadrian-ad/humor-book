    <p>We sometimes confuse a metric comparison with an overall emotional opinion &mdash;but they're not the same thing.</p>

      <p>Zoe grew a moderate humor bush with the <book-title>Tennis for Beginners</book-title> event. That means her overall opinion was mostly good. <callback>("Kind of fun.")</callback> Since she  enjoyed being outside, meeting new people and trying new things, she overall felt:</p>

    <p>Emma could have asked Zoe endless numbers of comparative questions. These might be metric comparisons of price, effort, outcome, and so on.

       <p><headline>Romance.</headline> We can use a humor bush to think about our partner likes us so much, and vice versa&mdash;even neither of us has ever cured a disease, modeled underwear, or won an olympic medal. People still like each other, despite everyone being able to compare everyone to literally everyone else in the world. Why is this?</p>
       
     <p>We already know the answer: metric comparisons are neither here nor there to our overall opinion. Instead, our overall opinion is based on our humor bush with them.</p>
         
         <p>People bond when they mutually and frequently feel intense feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. In other words, they have a large mutual humor bush! 
         
         <p>We emotionally orient toward things we have a  large humor bushes with&mdash;including our partner and friends. This is why a large humor bush is the same thing as having a high opinion of someone.</p> 
       
       <p>This process is independent of any metric comparisons we could chose to make&mdash;which is why people everywhere love people not for their comparative success but for the positive emotional experiences they have with each other.</p> 
        
       <p>This is why people tend to say that "humor" is their most important trait in a partner. <callback>(“someone I can laugh with,”</callback> <callback>“someone who makes me laugh,”</callback> <callback>“someone to be weird with together,”</callback> <callback>“someone with a great sense of humor,” and so on)</callback> We formost want a humor bush!</p>
       
       <p>We can expand how we think about this using humor family words too. If we say we want to be around <callback>"someone who accepts me,"</callback> <callback>"someone I feel safe with,"</callback> <callback>"someone I feel comfortable around,"</callback> this is <sem>also</sem> humor focus, since feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so onare also humor.</p> 
       
       <p>This positive opinion happens this way with romantic partners&mdash;but also friends, coworkers, neighborhoods, apartment complexes, online gaming lobbies, yarn stores, and so on. That's because these positive opinions all happen the same way, through cumulative experiences of humor.</p>
              
    <div class="consider">
                 <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
                  
            <p class="considertext">We looked at comedy <callback>(prioritizing intensity)</callback>, charm <callback>(prioritizing fittedness)</callback>, and promotion <callback>(prioritizing status)</callback>.</p>
            
            <p class="considertext">We sometimes see the same thing with romantic partners. Instead prioritizing judgement  through fittedness or intensity, someone judges a partner by whether they're status-increasing or not.</p> 
            
            <p class="considertext">We may hear or think statements like <callback>“we would look so good together,” “I want someone I can introduce to my parents too” “they're someone who will impress my friends,”</callback> and so on.</p> 
            
            <p class="considertext">But when we <sem-weak>prioritize</sem-weak> increasing a status-metric, we fall into metric-comparisons&mdash;which by themselves do not predict good experiences.</p> 
            
            <p class="considertext">People who don't prioritize a mutual humor bush often end up with brittle relationships, where their opinions of each other can quickly sour&mdash;since those relationships weren't grounded on a large mutual humor bush.</p> </div></div>

    <div class="content">

<p>Our overall opinion of something is the average amount of positive emotions we've felt toward it. We can use a humor bush with something as a proxy for our opinion of it.</p>

   <ul>
    <li>
     When presented between two things, we'll have a higher overall opinion of the one that we have a larger humor bush with. 
     </li>
    
    <li>
    Humor helps us understand the subjectivity of opinions. A beautiful walk sometimes makes us smile, and sometimes doesn't. We can use humor to understand what builds up our opinion of the walk.
    </li>
    
    <li>
    An overall opinion of an experience is objective-neutral. We can have a good experience even when we start comparing it negatively toward alternatives, goals, objectives, and so on.
