<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Our opinion isn't the same thing as a comparison</h1>


    <p>We sometimes confuse a metric comparison with an overall emotional opinion <callback>("humor bush")</callback>&mdash;but they're not the same thing.</p>
       
       <div class="consider">
           <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
           
           <p class="considertext">This is obvious in many cases. Let's say we're celebrating our birthday with all our favorite people, when someone asks us if we'd be making more money if we were at work than at our party. <callback>("metric comparison")</callback></p>
           
            <p class="considertext">Whether we say yes or no has no bearing on our overall opinion of our party. Even though metric comparisons of good or bad can sometimes overlap with our overall emotional opinion, they're not the same thing.</p>

      <p>Zoe grew a moderate humor bush with the <book-title>Tennis for Beginners</book-title> event. That means her overall opinion was mostly good. <callback>("Kind of fun.")</callback> Since she  enjoyed being outside, meeting new people and trying new things, she overall felt:</p>

    <p>There are endless numbers of questions Emma could ask Zoe. These might be metric comparisons of price, effort, outcome, and so on. But these are <term>different</term> than our <em>overall</em> opinion of something&mdash;which was how we emotionally experienced something.</p>
    
     <p>It's our humor bush that conveys our broadest emotional relation to something.</p> 
    
   <!--  <div class="consider">
        <p class="for-instance">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">Sometimes these overlap. If Zoe was desperately hoping to learn about tennis, it might have been a large mistake and a small OK to realize it wasn't an effective way to learn tennis, and this made everything else miserable.</p> 
         
         <p class="considertext">In this case, one metric assessment <callback>("learn efficiently about how to play tennis?")</callback> would overlap with her overall opinion. <callback>("Bad.")</callback> But even though this metric assessment  overlaps and seems to be related in this case with an overall opinion, they aren't the same thing!</p>

 <div class="consider">
            <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             <p class="considertext">There's nothing odd about having <term>good</term> overall opinion of something we also can make bad metric comparisons of, just like there's nothing odd about having a <em>bad</em> overall opinion of something we can also make good metric comparisons  of it.</p>  
             
             <p class="considertext">For instance, just because something is cheap <callback>("cheap compared to similar things")</callback> doesn't mean we'll have a good overall opinion of things. This specific metric comparison of cost is "good"&mdash;but that doesn't mean the overall opinion <sem>must</sem> be "good."</p> 
             
             <p class="considertext">Similarly, just because the tennis event was expensive <callback>("expensive compared to similar things")</callback> doesn't mean Zoe will have a bad opinion of it. This specific metric comparison is "bad"&mdash;but that  doesn't mean the overall opinion of the experience must be "bad" too.</p> 
         
         <p class="considertext">Zoe may have learned a lot about tennis <callback>("good")</callback> but also felt angry, lonely, unappreciated, uncomfortable, unwelcome, and so on <callback>("bad")</callback>. In this case, if Emma asks Zoe if she learned a lot, Zoe say <callback>"yes"</callback>but if asked if she has a good opinion of it she'll be ambivalent or say <callback>"no."</callback></p>

       <p><headline>Romance.</headline> We can use a humor bush to think about why like our partner so much. People bond when they mutually and frequently feel intense feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
       
       <p>In other words, they have a large mutual humor bush! As we've seen this chapter, this is  the same thing as having a very high opinion of each other. We emotionally orient toward things with large humor bushes&mdash;including our partner.</p> 
       
       <p>This is independent of any metric comparisons. We could ask how much our partner did or didn't inherent from their parents; whether they're as attractive as a statue; if they have a PhD or a bestselling book; won Olympic models; and so on.</p> 
       
       <p>These comparative metrics of them aren't the same thing as our overall emotional opinion of them&mdash;which is what would actually make up our opinion of our partner.</p>
       
       <p>This is why people tend to say that "humor" is their most important trait in a partner: <callback>“someone I can laugh with,”</callback> <callback>“someone who makes me laugh,”</callback> <callback>“someone to be weird with together,”</callback> <callback>“someone with a great sense of humor.”</callback> We want a humor bush foremost!</p>
       
       <p>We can use humor family words to expand how we think about this too. If someone says they want <callback>"someone who accepts me,"</callback> "someone I feel safe with," "someone I feel comfortable around," we can also see this as a humor focus, since when they feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on they feel humor.</p> 
       
       <p>When people can mutual build a humor bush, they emotionally orient toward each other, bond, and have a high opinion of each other&mdash;whether or not they've won Olympic models.</p>
              
    <div class="consider">
                 <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
                  
            <p class="considertext">We looked at comedy <callback>(prioritizing intensity)</callback> and charm <callback>(prioritizing fittedness)</callback> and last chapter we looked at promotion <callback>(prioritizing status)</callback>.</p>
            
            <p class="considertext">We sometimes see the same thing with romantic partners. Instead of judging things as good or bad through fittedness or intensity, they judge by whether it's status-increasing or not.</p> 
            
            <p class="considertext">They may say things like <callback>“we would look so good together,” <callback>“someone I can introduce to my parents”</callback> <callback>“someone that will impress my friends,”</callback> and so on.</p> 
            
            <p class="considertext">What we want foremost is to build a mutual humor bush with someone. If we're not prioritizing humor, we often end up with brittle relationships where people's opinions of each other can quickly sour&mdash;since it wasn't grounded on a large mutual humor bush.</p> </div></div>
