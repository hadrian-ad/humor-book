<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>



<p>We don’t know if we’ll have a good opinion of something just by its surface content—since we don’t know how much humor we’ll feel when we actually engage with it:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Justin’s colleague Dave gives him a six-hundred-page book called The Complete History of Chairs.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“Um.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;content on the surface seems dull)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <internalaction>(cheerfully)</internalaction> <speech>“Can’t judge a book by its cover!”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>The book is as boring as it sounds. As Justin turns the 500th page, he idly thinks that another author could have really made the material pop.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Justin doesn’t feel much fitted humor from the book&harr;&#xFE0E;Justin’s opinion isn’t directly related to surface content)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>The first paragraph hooks him. He reads all of it in a week.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Justin feels connection, delight, insight, joy, realization, revelation, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;Justin’s opinion isn’t directly related to surface content)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 


<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen and Emma are looking through the course catalogue.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*reading course title*</action> <speech>“Scandinavian Dragon-Hero Mythology 101?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Sounds awesome.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;surface content seems interesting)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*bummed*</action> <speech>“I have to take 20th Century Representations of Prehistoric Granaries with David Gilroy.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Oh no!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*makes face*</action> <speech>“Sounds hideously boring.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;surface content seems dull)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>They register for their classes.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Halfway through the semester, the Dragon-Hero class is Emma and Owen’s least favorite class. The professor and texts are dry, the assignments are long and poorly graded, and they dread going to lecture each week. The professor’s expertise is in dating manuscripts through statistics and corpus lists, and it’s clearly the only thing the professor cares about.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma and Owen don’t feel much fitted humor related to the class&harr;&#xFE0E;their opinion isn’t directly related to surface content)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>But Zoe immediately loves the Granaries class. She makes friends with everyone in the class; the professor takes them on great field trips; the slide shows are fascinating; and the representation of granaries is way more interesting and relevant than it has any right to be.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels belonging, connection, comfort, delight, insight, realization, welcome, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;her opinion isn’t directly related to surface content)</notes></p>
    </div>
 

<p><narration>Emma has to watch Electric City: History of the Scranton Tramlines—a documentary from the 1970s. There’s some interesting old footage, but also a lot of footage of the narrator talking to the camera as he’s sitting on a bench with an ugly skyline behind him. He sounds like he was born in the 19th century.</narration></p>

<p class="vig-indent"><narration>Emma watches it alone. She finds his national optimism distasteful and jingoistic. His generation sold them out cheap to the oil and car companies. She swivels in her chair and increases the playback speed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t feel any fitted humor from the documentary&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma feels the experience is bad or dull)</notes></p>

<p class="and-so-on">- OR -</p>

<p class="vig-indent"><narration>Emma gets Zoe to watch it with her. They point out interesting things in the footage, even rewinding a few times. Emma gives her frustrations an outlet by discussing the boosterism with Zoe. They imitate the way the narrator speaks for weeks after finishing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels fitted humor from watching the documentary with Zoe&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma feels the experience is good or interesting)</notes></p> 


<p>In the examples above, the overall surface content (“chairs,” “granaries,” “dragon-heroes,” “trams”) by itself wasn’t enough to determine whether anyone would have a good or bad opinion of the books, lectures, videos, and so on.</p> 

<p>That's because our opinions aren't based on content, but on our experiences with that content—and, specifically, how frequently and intensely they felt humor outcomes or humor family words.</p>

 

 

<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Mistake shamans.</headline> We focus on mistakes because we find them inherently interesting—and by extension, we find interesting the people who can characterize, describe, exaggerate, explain, influence, mitigate, or point out mistakes. This is part of the appeal of many authors, comedians, life coaches, podcasters, scientists, spiritualists, teachers, video essayists, and so on: they bring up and explain mistakes.</p> 
    
    <p>We’re drawn toward people who make us feel the most fitted humor the most frequently—since fitted humor means we see them as elegantly handling mistakes, putting us in the Goldilocks zone between mistake-predominant (anger, confusion, worry, and so on) and OK-predominant (boredom, daydreaming, unenthusiastic). We experience this as learning and growing.</p>
    
    <p>We don’t always think to notice this humor until it’s pointed out—but then we see it everywhere. When our partner listens to their favorite podcast, they sometimes laugh—when they read a nonfiction book that interests them, they’ll come to tell us about a passage—when they watch a new video by a content creator they like, they’ll smile as they watch it—and so on.</p>
