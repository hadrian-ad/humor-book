<h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can not forecast our opinion based on content</h1>



<p>We don’t know if we’ll have a good opinion of something just by its surface content—since we don’t know how much humor we’ll feel when we actually engage with it:</p>

    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*reading course title*</action> <speech>“Scandinavian Dragon-Hero Mythology 101?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Sounds <sem>awesome</sem>.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;surface content seems interesting)</notes></p>

    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Halfway through the semester, the Dragon-Hero class is Emma and Owen’s least favorite class. The professor and texts are dry, the assignments are long and poorly graded, and they dread going to lecture each week.</narration></p>

    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>But Zoe immediately loves the Ancient Granaries class.

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma has to watch <book-title>Electric City: History of the Scranton Tramlines</book-title>—a documentary from the 1970s. There’s some interesting old footage, but also a lot of footage of the narrator talking to the camera as he’s sitting on a bench with an ugly skyline behind him. He sounds like he was born in the 19th century.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Emma watches it alone. She finds his national optimism distasteful and jingoistic. His generation sold them out cheap to the oil and car companies. She swivels in her chair and increases the playback speed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t feel any fitted humor from the documentary&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma feels the experience is bad or dull)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Emma gets Zoe to watch it with her. They point out interesting things in the footage, even rewinding a few times. Emma gives her frustrations an outlet by discussing the boosterism with Zoe. They imitate the way the narrator speaks for weeks after finishing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels fitted humor from watching the documentary with Zoe&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma feels the experience is good or interesting)</notes></p> </div>


<p>In the examples above, the overall surface content <callback>(“chairs,” “granaries,” “dragon-heroes,” “trams”)</callback> by itself wasn’t enough to determine whether anyone would have a good or bad opinion of the books, lectures, videos, and so on.</p> 

<p>That's because our opinions aren't based on <term>content</term>, but on our <em>experiences</em> with that content—and, specifically, how frequently and intensely we feel humor outcomes or humor family words.</p>

 

 

<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Mistake shamans.</headline> We focus on mistakes because we find them inherently interesting.</p> 
   
   <div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
       <p class="considertext">Our senses are "difference-noticers," which are designed to screen out expected things and make unexpected things jump to the front of our attention.</p>
   </div> 
    
<p>   
   Since we find mistakes inherently interesting, by extension we find interesting the people who can take mistakes and 
   
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>characterize them</li>
        <li>describe them</li>
        <li>exaggerate them</li>
        <li>explain them</li>
        <li>influence them</li>
        <li>mitigate them</li>
        <li>point them out</li>
        </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>This is part of the appeal of many authors, comedians, life coaches, podcasters, scientists, spiritualists, teachers, video essayists, and so on: they deal with mistakes.</p> 
    
    <p>We’re drawn toward people who make us feel the most fitted humor the most frequently—since fitted humor means we see them as elegantly handling mistakes, putting us in the Goldilocks zone between mistake-predominant <callback>(<emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>confusion</emotions>, <emotions>worry</emotions>, and so on)</callback> and OK-predominant <callback>(<emotions>boredom</emotions>, <emotions>daydreaming</emotions>, <emotions>unenthusiastic</emotions>)</callback>. We experience this as learning and growing.</p>
    
    <p>We don’t always think to notice this humor until it’s pointed out—but then we see it everywhere. When our partner:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            listens to their favorite podcast, they'll often <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>
        </li>
        
        <li>
            reads a nonfiction book that interests them, they’ll come to tell us about a passage <callback>(<humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>)</callback>
        </li>
        
        <li>watches a new video by a content creator they like, they’ll be <humor-tell>relaxed</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>loose</humor-tell> in their chair—and so on.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This in turn grows a humor bush with those things, creating a positive overall opinion of them.</p>
