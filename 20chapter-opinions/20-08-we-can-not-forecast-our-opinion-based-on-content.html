<p>We don’t know in advance if we’ll have a good opinion of something just by its surface content&mdash;since we don’t know how much humor we’ll feel when we actually engage with it:</p>

   <p><narration>Owen and Emma are looking through the course catalogue.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*reading course title*</action> <speech>“Scandinavian Dragon-Hero Mythology 101?”</speech></p>

    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Halfway through the semester, the Dragon-Hero class is Emma and Owen’s least favorite class. The professor and texts are dry, the assignments are long and poorly graded, and they dread going to lecture each week.</narration></p> 
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>The professor’s expertise is in dating manuscripts through statistics and corpus lists, and it’s clearly the only thing the professor cares about.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma and Owen don’t feel much fitted humor related to the class&harr;&#xFE0E;their opinion is related to the <outcome-contrast>absence</outcome-contrast> of humor, not surface content)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>But Zoe immediately loves the Ancient Granaries class.

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma has to watch <book-title>Electric City: History of the Scranton Tramlines</book-title>&mdash;a documentary from the 1970s. There’s some interesting old footage, but also a lot of footage of the narrator talking to the camera as he’s sitting on a bench with an ugly skyline behind him. He sounds like he was born in the 19th century.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Emma watches it alone. She finds his national optimism distasteful and jingoistic. His generation sold them out cheap to the oil and car companies. She swivels in her chair and increases the playback speed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t feel any fitted humor from the documentary&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma's opinion is related to the <outcome-contrast>absence</outcome-contrast> of humor, not the surface content)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Emma gets Zoe to watch it with her. They point out interesting things in the footage, even rewinding a few times. Emma gives her frustrations an outlet by discussing the boosterism with Zoe. They imitate the way the narrator speaks for weeks after finishing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels fitted humor from watching the documentary with Zoe&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma's opinion is related to the <outcome-contrast>presence</outcome-contrast> of humor, not the surface content)</notes></p> </div>


<p>In the examples above, the overall surface content <callback>(“chairs,” “granaries,” “dragon-heroes,” “trams”)</callback> by itself wasn’t enough to determine whether anyone would have a good or bad opinion of the books, lectures, videos, and so on.</p> 

<p>That's because our opinions aren't based on <term>content</term>, but on our <em>experiences</em> with that content&mdash;and, specifically, how frequently and intensely we feel humor outcomes or humor family words.</p>

 <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Overall.</headline> When we don’t know how to explain our <term>opinion</term> of things, we often try to explain the <em>content</em> instead. But this doesn't really work.</p> 
    
    <p>For instance, if we took a long walk and had a good opinion of it, we might try to explain this good opinion by describing content. <callback>(The weather, temperature, colors, sounds, and so on.)</callback></p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

    
    <p>But focusing on content isn’t a genuine explanation of our opinions. We know this because even with the same weather, temperature, colors, sounds, we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> always have a good opinion of our walk. That's because our overall opinion isn't formed by the content by itself&mdash;instead, our opinion is our <sem-weak>evaluation</sem-weak> of that content.</p>
    
    <p>Our evaluations&mdash;mistakes and OKs&mdash;generate emotions. These emotions occur in one of three zones: mistake-predominant, balanced, and OK-predominant. It's not the mistake-predominant or OK-predominant zones that generate good opinion. We don't use positive languages about our experiences until we feel balanced emotions <callback>(humor family words)</callback>.</p>
    
    <p>When we feel humor family words, we're experiencing <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. It's the presence of these evaluatory experiences&mdash;not the specific weather or sounds by themselves&mdash;that lets us characterize the walk as good.</p>
