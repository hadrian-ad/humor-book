<p>We don’t know if we’ll have a good opinion of something just by its surface content. That's because we don’t know how much humor we’ll feel when we actually engage with it:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma has to watch <book-title>Electric City: History of the Scranton Tramlines</book-title>—a documentary from the 1970s. There’s some interesting old footage, but also a lot of footage of the narrator talking to the camera as he’s sitting on a bench with an ugly skyline behind him. He sounds like he was born in the 19th century.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Emma watches it alone. She finds his national optimism distasteful and jingoistic. His generation sold them out cheap to the oil and car companies.

    <p class="and-so-on">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Emma gets Zoe to watch it with her. They point out interesting things in the footage, even rewinding a few times. Emma gives her frustrations an outlet by discussing the boosterism with Zoe. They imitate the way the narrator speaks for weeks after finishing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels fitted humor from watching the documentary with Zoe&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma's opinion is related to the <outcome-contrast>presence</outcome-contrast> of humor, not the surface content)</notes></p> </div>


<p>In the examples above, the overall surface content <callback>(“chairs,” “granaries,” “dragon-heroes,” “trams”)</callback> by itself wasn’t enough to determine whether anyone would have a good or bad opinion of the books, lectures, videos, and so on.</p> 

<p>That's because our opinions aren't based on <term>content</term>, but on our <em>experiences</em> with that content—and, specifically, how frequently and intensely we feel humor outcomes or humor family words.</p>

 <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Overall.</headline> When we don’t know how to explain our <term>opinion</term> of things, we often try to explain the <em>content</em> instead. But this doesn't really work.</p> 
    
    <p>For instance, if we took a long walk and had a good opinion of it, we might try to explain this good opinion by describing content. <callback>(The weather, temperature, colors, sounds, and so on.)</callback></p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

    
    <p>But focusing on content isn’t a genuine explanation of our opinions. We know this because even with the same weather, temperature, colors, sounds, we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> always have a good opinion of our walk. That's because our overall opinion isn't formed by the content by itself—instead, our opinion is our <sem>evaluation</sem> of that content.</p>
    
    <p>Our evaluations—mistakes and OKs—generate emotions. These emotions occur in one of three zones: mistake-predominant, balanced, and OK-predominant. It's not the mistake-predominant or OK-predominant zones that generate good opinion. We don't use positive languages about our experiences until we feel balanced emotions <callback>(humor family words)</callback>.</p>
    
    <p>When we feel humor family words, we're experiencing <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. It's the presence of these evaluatory experiences—not the specific weather or sounds by themselves—that lets us characterize the walk as good.</p>
