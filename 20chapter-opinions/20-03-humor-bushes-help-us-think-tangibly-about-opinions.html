<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor bushes help us think tangibly about opinions</h1>


<p>Sometimes, we encounter advice, complaints, criticisms, evaluations, and so on that can seem arbitrary, confusing, mysterious, and so on. <callback>(“I just… like it.”)</callback> It can be hard to think through these opinions:</p> 


<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“What do you like about GrosTech’s music?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*shrugs*</action> <speech>“I dunno. I just… like it.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“It makes me uncomfortable that you like something but you can’t say why.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Alina struggles to make sense of opinions)</notes></p>
    </div> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*complaining to Heather*</action> <speech>“Each semester some of my evals say that my courses are 'dull.' And that’s all they say! If they would just, you know, <sem-weak>use more words</sem-weak>, maybe I could understand what they mean!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin struggles to make sense of opinions)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>Justin finds a characterization of his course as <callback>“dull”</callback> to be opaque. He thinks that if someone doesn’t connect <callback>“dull”</callback> to something specific, he can't know what the actual problem is.</p>

<p>But he doesn't actually need to know specifics to make sense of it. Instead, he needs to recognize it as an overall opinion&mdash;which is a humor bush. A humor bush isn't about any one thing specifically, but is about everything about his class.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If the student actually disliked something in <term>particular</term>, they would have said something specific. <callback>(“The quiz formats were unfair.”)</callback> The student is instead conveying a <em>general</em> opinion, about everything.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">This general opinion is the general opinion <callback>(“dull”)</callback>, and can’t be replaced by anecdotes. There isn’t any one thing to fix—instead, the student wishes they felt more <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. This is an open-ended problem with open-ended solutions.</p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>The student felt their humor bush with the class or with Justin was unfitted—they felt they didn’t feel enough humor family words or reached humor outcomes easily enough, and so had an overall negative opinion <callback>("dull")</callback>.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Feedback.</headline> If we get an overall <term>positive</term> opinions <callback>("I liked it" "interesting" "great!")</callback>, we don’t usually think that these overall positive opinions are confusing, unknowable, or can’t be understood without specific examples. Instead, we take it as a holistic opinion.</p>
    
    <p>However, we sometimes do the opposite with an overall <em>negative</em> opinions <callback>(“dull”)</callback>. We assume there must be specific things negative opinions refer to, or are else confusing or unknowable. But just like positive opinions, we should take negative opinions holistically too.</p>
    
    <p>There isn't always a specific thing that causes an overall opinion, since the overall opinion is an average of humor generally. The presence or absence of humor over <sem>many</sem> experiences composes our overall opinion of something, and we can't explain a humor bush through a single example.</p>
