<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>


<p>Sometimes, we encounter advice, complaints, criticisms, evaluations, and so on that can seem arbitrary, confusing, mysterious, and so on. (“I just… like it.”)</p> 


<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“What do you like about GrosTech’s music?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <action>*shrugs*</action> <speech>“I dunno. I just… like it.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Alina:</speaker> <speech>“It makes me uncomfortable that you like something but you can’t say why.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Alina struggles to make sense of opinions)</notes></p>
    </div> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*complaining to Heather*</action> <speech>“Each semester some of my evals say that my courses are 'dull.' And that’s all they say! If they would just, you know, use more words, maybe I could understand what they mean!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin struggles to make sense of opinions)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>Justin finds a characterization of his course as “dull” to be opaque. He thinks that if someone doesn’t connect “dullness” to something specific, he can't know what the actual problem is.</p>

<p>But he doesn't actually need to know specifics to make sense of it. Instead, he can think of an opinion as a humor bush—which then covers everything about his class.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If the student actually disliked something in particular, they would have said something specific. (“The quiz formats were unfair.”) The student is instead conveying a general opinion, about everything.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">This general opinion can’t be replaced by anecdotes—the general opinion is the general opinion. (“Dull.”) There isn’t any one thing to fix—instead, the student wishes they felt more achievement, comfort, connection, delight, insight, realization, welcome, and so on. This is a problem with open-ended solutions.</p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>The student felt their humor bush with the class or with Justin was unfitted—they felt they didn’t feel enough humor family words or reached humor outcomes easily enough, and so had an overall negative opinion ("dull").</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Feedback.</headline> If we get positive opinions ("I liked it" "interesting" "great!"), we don’t usually think that these overall opinions are confusing, unknowable, or can’t be understood without specific examples of what the feedback is referring too.</p>
    
    <p>Even so, we sometimes do think this for negative opinions (“dull”). Instead of taking them holistically, like we do with positive opinions, we assume there must be specific things they’re referring too. But we should treat these negative and positive opinions the same ways.</p>
    
    <p>There isn't always a specific thing that causes an overall opinion—since the overall opinion is the sum opinion. In some cases, this opinion is over an experience that lasted potentially for months, over a variety of activities and subjects.</p>
    
    <p>We can have a foothold into thinking about these overall opinions when we use humor bushes. Whether good or bad, we take these opinions as assessments of how someone emotionally experienced things.</p>
