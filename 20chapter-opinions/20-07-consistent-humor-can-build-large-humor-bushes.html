<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Constancy can bulid large humor bushes</h1>



<p>Steady humor can grow a larger humor bush than does intermittent but intense humor:</p>

<p>Above, two spikes of intense humor doesn't outperform the consistent humor at growing a humor bush.</p>

<p>If Heather wants to grow a humor bush, she could begin and end her class with something that makes the class laugh&mdash;two spikes of high-intensity humor. On the other hand, she could instead open the windows&mdash;which would let the students feel consistent low-intensity humor.</p>

    <p class="considertext">When a teacher opens a window and lets in some air and sounds of birds and leaves, we can imagine the class having low-intensities of <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxed postures</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, and so on. We'd be feeling consistent, low-intensity humor.</p>
</div>

<p>Heather can both tell jokes <sem-weak>and</sem-weak> open the windows, so itâ€™s not one or the other. But it's worth noting that a teacher who never tells a single joke still has many ways of creating an environment that generates fitted humor&mdash;like by having a pleasant room.</p>

    <p class="considertext">To think about how an open window contributes to a humor bush, we can think about our own room. When it's nice weather and we open the window, do we sometimes feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on? Does it <outcome-contrast>promote</outcome-contrast> opportunities to <humor-tell>brighten</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, and so on? This contributes to a humor bush.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">If our landlord came and nailed shut the window, would we feel <outcome-contrast>less</outcome-contrast> <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on? Would it <outcome-contrast>reduce</outcome-contrast> opportunities to <humor-tell>brighten</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, and so on? This hinders a humor bush.</p>

    <p class="considertext">The open window can promote low-intensities of humor. This in turn makes the window a component of our overall humor bush with things tangential to the window&mdash;whether our window opens or not changes our overall opinion of our apartment, mornings, neighborhood, and so on.</p>

    <p><headline>Windows.</headline> It can be unusual at first to think of windows as contributing to a humor bush. But it makes more sense when we look at an open window in a public restroom:</p>

    <p>Above, the the towel dispenser has been put near an window with wooden trim, which overlooks a forest and lake. A flowering plant has been tended so that it hangs over the window. Anyone using the towels can look out the open window.</p> 
    
    <p>If we imagine being here, we may feel low-intensities of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. We may <humor-tell>brighten</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, and so on. The humor bush constitutes our good opinion of this bathroom relative to other public bathrooms.</p>
