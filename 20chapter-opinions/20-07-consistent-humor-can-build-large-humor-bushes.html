<p>Steady humor often grows a larger humor bush than does intermittent but intense humor:</p>



<p>Above, two intense spikes of humor don’t outperform the consistent humor at growing a humor bush.</p>

<p>Heather could begin and end her class with something that makes the class laugh—two spikes of high-intensity humor. But she can also open the windows—which lets the students feel consistent low-intensity humor, like brightening, loosening, relaxed posture, touching self, focusing on present, and so on.</p> 

<p>Heather can both tell jokes and open the windows, so it’s not one or the other. But it also means that a teacher who never wants to tell a single joke still has many ways of creating an environment that generates fitted humor.</p>

    <p class="consider">Consider</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">To think about how an open window contributes to a humor bush, we can think about our own room. When it's nice weather and we open the window, do we sometimes feel appreciation, belonging, comfort, delight, safety, welcome, and so on? Do we feel the air and brighten, loosen, relax, focus on present, and so on? This contributes to a humor bush.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">If our landlord came and nailed shot the window, would we feel less appreciation, belonging, comfort, delight, safety, welcome, and so on? Would it reduce opportunities to brighten, loosen, relax, focus on present, and so on? This hinders or limits a humor bush.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">In these cases, the open window can contribute to our humor bush—which makes it a component of our overall humor bush we have with our apartment, neighborhood, classroom, or so on.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Windows.</headline> A window can contribute to a humor bush. This can be an unusual way of thinking at first, but it makes more sense when we look at an open window in a public restroom:</p>
    
    <p>Above, the the towel dispenser has been put near an window with wooden trim, which overlooks a forest and lake. A flowering plant has been tended so that it hangs over the window. Anyone using the towels can look out the open window.</p> 
    
    <p>As we do this, we may feel low-intensities of appreciation, belonging, comfort, delight, safety, welcome, and so on. This humor constitutes our good opinion of this bathroom, relative to other public bathrooms.</p>
