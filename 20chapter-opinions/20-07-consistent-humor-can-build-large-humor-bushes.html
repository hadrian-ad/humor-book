<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Consistent humor can build large humor bushes</h1>



<p>Steady humor often grows a larger humor bush than does intermittent but intense humor:</p>

<p>Above, two intense spikes of humor don’t outperform the consistent humor at growing a humor bush.</p>

<p>Heather could begin and end her class with something that makes the class laugh—two spikes of high-intensity humor. But she can also open the windows—which lets the students feel consistent low-intensity humor, like <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relaxed posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on present</humor-tell>, and so on.</p> 

<p>Heather can both tell jokes <sem-weak>and</sem-weak> open the windows, so it’s not one or the other. But it also means that a teacher who never wants to tell a single joke still has many ways of creating an environment that generates fitted humor.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p class="consider">Consider</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">To think about how an open window contributes to a humor bush, we can think about our own room. When it's nice weather and we open the window, do we sometimes feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on? Do we feel the air and <humor-tell>brighten</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <emotions>focus on present</emotions>, and so on? This contributes to a humor bush.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">If our landlord came and nailed shot the window, would we feel <outcome-contrast>less</outcome-contrast> <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on? Would it <outcome-contrast>reduce</outcome-contrast> opportunities to <humor-tell>brighten</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>relax</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on present</humor-tell>, and so on? This hinders or limits a humor bush.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">In these cases, the open window can contribute to our humor bush—which makes it a component of our overall humor bush we have with our apartment, neighborhood, classroom, or so on.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Windows.</headline> A window can contribute to a humor bush. This can be an unusual way of thinking at first, but it makes more sense when we look at an open window in a public restroom:</p>

    <p>Above, the the towel dispenser has been put near an window with wooden trim, which overlooks a forest and lake. A flowering plant has been tended so that it hangs over the window. Anyone using the towels can look out the open window.</p> 
    
    <p>As we do this, we may feel low-intensities of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. This humor constitutes our good opinion of this bathroom, relative to other public bathrooms.</p>
