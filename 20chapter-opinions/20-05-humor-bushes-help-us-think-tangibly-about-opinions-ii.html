<p>To think more about how our opinion is based on humor bushes, we can compare two variations of Heather—one that frequently generates low-intensity humor, and the other that doesn’t: </p>

<div class="vignette">
    Heather A
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“And so if we multiply by the denominator like this we get seven.”</speech></p>

<div class="vignette">
   Heather A
    
    <p><narration>Lina and Xiaowei walk into Heather’s class. It’s white and empty, just like every other classroom. They sit down at their grey plastic desks.</narration> <notes>(&larr;no humor tells&harr;&#xFE0E;doesn’t grow humor bush)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    Heather B
    <p><narration>Lina and Xiaowei walk into Heather’s class. There are plants everywhere and nice windows with trees outside.

<p>Both Heather A and Heather B are teaching the exact same content. But her students would have a higher opinion of the Heather that grows a larger humor bush.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">While we looked at “Heather A and Heather B,” we can do the same thing with any comparison—like between “math teacher #1 and math teacher #2,” “social studies class and math class,” "middle school and high school," and so on.</p>


<p class="considertext">In any comparison, students will have a high opinion of the one they have a large, fitted humor bush with, and a low opinion of things they don’t.</p> 


<p>If students have a well-fitted humor bush in a class, they’ll remember that class or teacher as effective, enjoyable, fun, great, recommendable, and so on. If the students don’t have a well-fitted humor bush in a class, they’ll remember the class or teacher as controlling, creepy, dull, off, weird, and so on.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Unfitted.</headline> Sometimes teachers annoy us when they ignore fittedness and focus on intensity. They may try to make us feel humor with comics, funny voices, games, gimmicks, wisecracks, and so on. But if they’re annoying us, they’re not actually building a humor bush with us!</p>
    
    <p>To build a humor bush with us, we have to actually feel humor—and usually, it has to be fitted humor. That's because we often have a high dress code in a class, since our standard for efficiency and cohesion goes up. This means we often censure humor attempts that are irrelevant or time consuming—even if we laugh.</p>
