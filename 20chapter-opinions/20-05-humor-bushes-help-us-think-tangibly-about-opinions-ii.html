<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor bushes help us think tangibly about opinions</h1>




<p>To think more about how our opinion is based on humor bushes, we can compare two variations of Heather—one that frequently generates low-intensity humor, and the other that doesn’t: </p>

<p>Both Heather A and Heather B are teaching the exact same content. But her students would have a higher opinion of the Heather that grows a larger humor bush.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">While we looked at <callback>“Heather A and Heather B,”</callback> we can do the same thing with any comparison—like between <callback>“math teacher #1 and math teacher #2,”</callback> <callback>“social studies class and math class,”</callback> <callback>"middle school and high school,"</callback> and so on.</p>
    
    
    <p class="considertext">In any comparison, students will have a high opinion of the things they have a large, fitted humor bush with, and have a low opinion of things they don’t.</p> </div>


<p>If students have a well-fitted humor bush in a class, they’ll remember that class or teacher as effective, enjoyable, fun, great, recommendable, and so on. If the students <outcome-contrast>don’t</outcome-contrast> have a well-fitted humor bush in a class, they’ll remember the class or teacher as controlling, creepy, dull, off, weird, and so on.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Unfitted.</headline> Sometimes teachers annoy us when they ignore fittedness and focus on intensity. They may intuitively know how important humor is, but not have a strong ability with fitted humor.</p>
    
    <p>In these cases, we may see them wasting time with comics, funny voices, pointless games, long gimmicks, wisecracks, cringy videos, and so on. This isn't a problem with humor, though&mdash;we're not feeling humor, but annoyance! The teacher has an annoyance problem.</p> 
    
    <p>To build a humor bush with us, we have to actually feel humor, not just be exposed to unfitted humor attempts. If their humor attempts don't meet or exceed the situation's standard of efficiency and cohesion, we'll feel the humor attempt is irrelevant or time-consuming&mdash;and we'll censure them, even if we laugh.</p> 
    
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider: </p>
        <p class="considertext">One of many reasons teachers can't act like our friends is because students have a higher dress code with teachers than they do with their friends. This means we censure humor attempts from our teachers that we tolerate in our friends.</p> </div>
