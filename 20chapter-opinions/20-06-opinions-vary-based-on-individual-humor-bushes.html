<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Opinions vary based on individual humor bushes</h1>



<p>Everyone in Heather’s class will have a different size humor bush, since each student feels a different amount of humor. As humor bushes change, their opinions change too:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>Xiaowei feels the content is unmanageable, and so often feels <emotions>confusion</emotions> and <emotions>failure</emotions> instead of humor. <callback>(Less humor overall, lower opinion)</callback></li>
    <li>Lina feels the material is difficult but manageable, and frequently feels <emotions>accomplishment</emotions> and <emotions>insight</emotions>. <callback>(More humor overall, higher opinion)</callback></li>
    <li>Santiago feels the content is tragically easy and often feels <emotions>boredom</emotions> and <emotions>waste</emotions>. <callback>(Less humor overall, lower opinion)</callback></li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p>Even though they’re all seeing the same content, their opinion of the class varies based on their humor bush:</p>

<p>Xiaowei and Santiago still think positively of Heather’s class—but they don’t think of the class as positively as Lina does, who most often feels humor.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Source.</headline> Where do our opinions come from? We sometimes have the unsatisfying idea that overall opinions just exist somehow. We know we can list: 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>the coworkers we like the most</li>
        <li>our favorite vacation</li>
        <li>our favorite movies</li>
        <li>our favorite classes</li>
        <li>a comparison between two McDonald’s</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>But even though we can list these, sometimes we think these opinions are due to unthinkable processes that can't be examined.</p>
    
    <p>But we can see how our humor bush lines up well with our overall opinion of different things. This is still subjective—it’s based on mistakes and OKs—but this subjective quality is something we can think through and understand.</p>
