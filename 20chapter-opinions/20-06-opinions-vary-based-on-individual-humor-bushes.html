<p>Everyone in Heather’s class will have a different size humor bush, since each student feels a different amount of humor:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>Xiaowei feels the content is unmanageable, and so often feels <emotions>confusion</emotions> and <emotions>failure</emotions> instead of humor. <callback>(Less humor overall, lower opinion)</callback></li>
    <li>Lina feels the material is difficult but manageable, and frequently feels <emotions>accomplishment</emotions> and <emotions>insight</emotions>. <callback>(More humor overall, higher opinion)</callback></li>
    <li>Santiago feels the content is tragically easy and often feels <emotions>boredom</emotions> and <emotions>waste</emotions>. <callback>(Less humor overall, lower opinion)</callback></li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p>Even though they’re all seeing the same content, their opinion of the class varies based on their humor bush:</p>

<p>Xiaowei and Santiago still think positively of Heather’s class&mdash;even though they don’t think of the class as positively as Lina does, who most often feels humor.</p>

    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We can also compare different moments. We may have a period of time with a partner we think back on fondly, which was followed by a period of trouble. We have a large humor bush with one set of memories, and a small humor bush with another. </p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Source.</headline> Where do our opinions come from? We sometimes have the unsatisfying idea that overall opinions just exist somehow. We know we can list: 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>the coworkers we like the most</li>
        <li>our favorite vacation</li>
        <li>our favorite movies</li>
        <li>our favorite classes</li>
        <li>a comparison between two McDonald’s</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>But even though we can list these, sometimes we think these opinions are due to unthinkable processes that can't be examined.</p>
    
    <p>But we can see how our humor bush lines up well with our overall opinion of different things. This is still subjective&mdash;it’s based on mistakes and OKs&mdash;but this subjective quality is something we can think through and understand.</p>
