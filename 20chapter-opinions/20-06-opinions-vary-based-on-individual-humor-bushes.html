<p>Everyone in Heather’s class will have a different size humor bush, since each student feels a different amount of humor. As humor bushes change, their opinions change too:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>Xiaowei feels the content is unmanageable, and so often feels confusion and failure instead of humor. (Less humor overall, lower opinion)</li>
    <li>Lina feels the material is difficult but manageable, and frequently feels accomplishment and insight. (More humor overall, higher opinion)</li>
    <li>Santiago feels the content is tragically easy and often feels boredom and waste. (Less humor overall, lower opinion)</li> 

    </ul> 
    
    <p>Even though they’re all seeing the same content, their opinion of the class varies based on their humor bush:</p> 
    

<p>Xiaowei and Santiago still think positively of Heather’s class—but they don’t think of the class as positively as Lina does, who most often feels humor.</p>



<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Source.</headline> Where do our opinions come from? There’s often the unsatisfying idea that overall opinions just exist somehow: we can list the coworkers we like the most; our favorite vacation; our favorite movies; our favorite class; a comparison between two McDonald’s; and so on—due to some sort of unthinkable process that can’t be examined.</p>
    
    <p>The alternative is to use something like humor bushes: a strong proxy metric for our opinion of something, which tends to line up well with our favorite vacation, our favorite movie, and so on. This is still subjective—it’s based on mistakes and OKs—but this subjective quality is something we can think through and understand.</p>
