<h1 id="exclude-navigation">20. Opinions</h1>


<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at how humor and humor bushes are our opinions.</p> 

<p>Our <vocab>opinion</vocab> of something is based on our humor bush with it. This is obvious when we think about Emma’s relation to her university.</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>Emma will have a <term>good</term> opinion of her university if she <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> gains new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>constantly</outcome-contrast> feels accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>often</outcome-contrast> symbolizes close ties</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>can <outcome-contrast>easily</outcome-contrast> ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> create rapport with others students</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
     
    <li>Emma will have a <em>bad</em> opinion of her university if she <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> gains new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> feels accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> symbolize close ties</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>can <outcome-contrast>never</outcome-contrast> seem to ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> create rapport with others students</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>

<p>The size of Emma’s humor bush will correspond to her opinion of her university.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">At first, it can seem odd to talk about growing a humor bush with something abstract or inanimate like a university. But it’s not that odd once we think about it. We become fond of comedic movies, games, mementos, people, toys, and so on when they generate humor in us—since humor constitutes our good opinion of them.
        </p> 
        
    <p class="considertext">We can also use asymmetric and mutual humor bushes with abstract or inanimate things. Emma has an asymetric humor bush with her university, since the university doesn't feel much humor toward her in return. When she returns to campus, she feels more <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on than the institution does to her in return. This is what many alumni notice sharply when they return to campus years later.</p>
           
    <p class="considertext">This is in contrast to visiting distant relatives many years later. If Emma spent a summer with them, they'd grow a mutual humor bush. And so when she returns, they both feel mutual amounts of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mbash;even if it happens years and years later.
               
                </p>
    
        </div>

<p>This is something we'll be discussing throughout this chapter.</p> 

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Humor family words.</headline> When talking about humor bushes last chapter, we mainly used <term>humor outcomes</term>. <callback>("have they created <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>strong</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, or <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>weak</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>?")</callback> But we can also use <em>humor family words</em> too. <callback>("do they feel <outcome-contrast>strong</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, or <outcome-contrast>weak</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>?")</callback>.</p>  
    
     
    
    <p>Often, humor family words are helpful when thinking about the humor bushes we have with places and institutions—like how whether Emma likes her university or not depends on how often she experiences  <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>If over time, she characterizes her experiences as <outcome-contrast>complete</outcome-contrast> <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <outcome-contrast>frequent</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishments</emotions>, <outcome-contrast>constant</outcome-contrast> <emotions>insight</emotions>, <outcome-contrast>overall</outcome-contrast> <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on, she’ll have a large humor bush with the university—and a good opinion of it.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>By contrast, if she feels <emotions>rejection</emotions> <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions>acceptance</emotions>)</callback>, <emotions>failure</emotions> <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>)</callback>, <emotions>boredom</emotions> <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions>insight</emotions>)</callback>, fear <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <emotions>safety</emotions>)</callback>, and so on, she’ll have a very small humor bush with the university—and a bad opinion of it.</p>
