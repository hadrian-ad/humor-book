<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at how humor and humor bushes are our opinions.</p> 

<p>Our opinion of something is based on our humor bush with it. This is obvious when we think about Emma’s relation to her university.</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>Emma will have a good opinion of her university if she frequently gains new perspectives, constantly feels accepted, often symbolizes close ties, can easily ease tension, frequently create rapport with others students, and so on.</li>
     
    <li>Emma will have a bad opinion of her university if she rarely gains new perspectives, never feels accepted, doesn’t symbolize close ties, can never seem to ease tension, rarely create rapport with others students, and so on.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The size of Emma’s humor bush will correspond to her opinion of her university.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">At first, it can seem odd to talk about growing a humor bush with something abstract or inanimate like a university. But it’s not that odd once we think about it. We become fond of comedic movies, games, mementos, people, toys, and so on when they generate humor in us—humor constitutes our good opinion of them.
    </p> 

<p>This is something we'll be discussing throughout this chapter.</p> 

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Humor family words.</headline> When talking about humor bushes last chapter, we mainly used humor outcomes. ("have they created strong rapport, or weak rapport?") But we can also use humor family words too. ("do they feel strong accomplishment, or weak accomplishment?").</p>  
    
     
    
    <p>Often, humor family words are helpful when thinking about the humor bushes we have with places—like how whether Emma likes her university or not depends on how often she feels emotions like acceptance, belonging, accomplishment, appreciation, comfort, connection, generosity, insight, safety, welcome, and so on.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>If over time, she feels complete acceptance, frequent accomplishments, constant insight, overall safety, and so on, she’ll have a large humor bush with the university—and a good opinion of it.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>By contrast, if she feels rejection (not acceptance), failure (not accomplishment), boredom (not insight), fear (not safety), and so on, she’ll have a very small humor bush with the university—and a bad opinion of it.</p>
