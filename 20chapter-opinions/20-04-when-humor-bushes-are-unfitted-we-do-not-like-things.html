<p>We can look at more opinions:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Lina is hanging out at Xiaowei’s house.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <speech>“Honestly, Mr. Myrtle is weird.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(concerned)</internalaction> <speech>“What do you mean by that?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Heather wants to know more about an opinion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <action>*shrugs*</action> <speech>“I dunno.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Lina struggles to explain her opinion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <speech>“Like, he keeps asking us what we do on the weekend? It’s weird.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Xiaowei tries characterize an opinion with an anecdote)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“And it makes you uncomfortable?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <speech>“Kind of. But it’s more like because he tries too hard? He keeps asking us about ‘apps.’ But no one really wants to talk about it?” </speech><notes>(&larr;Lina tries to clarify opinion with anecdote)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <speech>“Everyone is just silent. It’s kind of funny.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(thoughtfully)</internalaction> <speech>“Hm.”</speech></p> 
    </div>
    
<p>Heather can use humor bushes as a tangible way of thinking about Lina and Xiaowei’s overall opinion of Mr. Myrtle—since their overall opinion of Mr. Myrtle <sem>is</sem> their humor bush with him. </p>

<p>Whatever Mr. Myrtle’s motives are, his students feel the size of humor bush he’s trying to grow is unfitted. Taken overall, he wants to <humor-outcome>have <outcome-contrast>strong</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>have a <outcome-contrast>strong</outcome-contrast> ability to open new topics of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> symbolize very close ties</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 

<p>Xiaowei and Lina register this as unfitted—it’s outside what they think the humor bush dress code should be. And outside of what Mr. Myrtle seems to want, the <sem-weak>actual</sem-weak> humor bush seems unfittedly small. <callback>(“Everyone is just silent.”)</callback></p>

<p>Because of this, they describe the class as off-putting or weird, and censure Mr. Myrtle to Heather.</p>

     <p><headline>Opinions.</headline> 
     When someone doesn’t know how to convey their <term>overall</term> opinion, they sometimes use <em>specific</em> anecdotes, complaints, praise, suggestions, and so on. We shouldn’t focus too much on these. Instead, we should use them as guides to their overall opinion.</p> 
     
     <div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
         <p class="for-instance-text">When Lina shares an anecdote about Mr. Myrtle, she’s trying to convey something about a <sem-weak>year-long</sem-weak> issue about how the class and the teacher relate to each other. The issue isn’t in the <term>anecdote</term>—the issue is in the <em>overall</em> opinion, which is broader than just the anecdote.</p> </div>
     
     <p>There are hundreds of ways to increase the amount of fitted humor in an experience. <sem>All</sem> of these may work to raise an overall opinion.</p> 
     
     <p>But if we fixate on a single anecdote, it suddenly seems like there’s just <term>one</term> place to increase fitted humor—even though there are actually <em>many</em>. This can narrow our understanding of how things can improve&mdash;and at worst, can cause us to miss the forest for the trees.</p> 
     
     <div class="for-instance">
         <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
         <p class="for-instance-text">If there was more fitted humor everywhere else in Mr. Myrtle's class, Lina's and Xiaowei's overall opinion of him would improve.</p> 
         
         <p class="for-instance-text">The same anecdotal instance would no longer seem representative of their overall experience. That's because the actual issue isn't in the specific anecdote, but in the lack of fitted humor in general.</p>
