<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>




<p>We can look at more opinions:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Lina is hanging out at Xiaowei’s house.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <speech>“Honestly, Mr. Myrtle is weird.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(concerned)</internalaction> <speech>“What do you mean by that?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Heather wants to know more about an opinion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <action>*shrugs*</action> <speech>“I dunno.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Lina struggles to explain her opinion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <speech>“Like, he keeps asking us what we do on the weekend? It’s weird.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Xiaowei tries characterize an opinion with an anecdote)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“And it makes you uncomfortable?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <speech>“Kind of. But it’s more like because he tries too hard? He keeps asking us about ‘apps.’ But no one really wants to talk about it?” </speech><notes>(&larr;Lina tries to clarify opinion with anecdote)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <speech>“Everyone is just silent. It’s kind of funny.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(thoughtfully)</internalaction> <speech>“Hm.”</speech></p> 
    </div>
    
<p>We can use humor bushes as a tangible way of thinking about Lina and Xiaowei’s overall opinion of Mr. Myrtle—since their opinion of Mr. Myrtle is their humor bush with him. </p>

<p>Whatever Mr. Myrtle’s motives are, his students feel the size of humor bush he’s trying to grow is unfitted. Taken overall, he wants to have strong rapport, have a strong ability to open new topics of conversation, frequently symbolize very close ties, frequently deal with taboo topics, and so on.</p> 

<p>Xiaowei and Lina register this as unfitted—it’s outside what they think the humor bush dress code should be. And outside of the humor bush Mr. Myrtle seems to want, the actual humor bush seems unfittedly small. (“Everyone is just silent.”)</p>

<p>Because of this, they describe the class as off-putting or weird, and censure Mr. Myrtle to Heather.</p>

 

<div class="vignette"> 
     <p><headline>Opinions.</headline> Sometimes, when someone doesn’t know how to convey their overall opinion, they use specific anecdotes, complaints, praise, suggestions, and so on. We shouldn’t focus too much on these, and instead use them as guides to their overall opinion.</p> 
     
     <p>For instance, When Lina shares an anecdote about Mr. Myrtle, she’s trying to convey something about a year-long issue about how the class and the teacher relate to each other. The issue isn’t in the anecdote—the issue is in the overall opinion, which is broader than just the anecdote.</p> 
     
     <p>We can make more sense of this by thinking about humor bushes. There are hundreds of ways to increase the amount of fitted humor in an experience. All of these may work to raise an overall opinion.</p> 
     
     <p>But if we fixate on a single anecdote, it suddenly seems like there’s just one place to increase fitted humor—even though there are actually many. This can narrow our understanding of how things can improve. At worst, we can miss the forest for the trees.</p> 
     
     <p>For instance, if there was more fitted humor everywhere else in Mr. Myrtle's class, Lina's and Xiaowei's overall opinion of him would improve. The anecdotal instance would no longer seem like an accurate characterization of their overall experience. That's because the actual issue isn't in the specific anecdote, but in the lack of fitted humor in general.</p>
