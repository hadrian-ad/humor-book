<h2 id="exclude-navigation">We don't like unfitted humor bushes</h2>




<p>We can look at another instance of looking past a single anecdote:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Lina is hanging out at Xiaowei’s house.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <speech>“Honestly, Mr. Myrtle is weird.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(concerned)</internalaction> <speech>“What do you mean by that?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Heather wants to know more about an opinion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <action>*shrugs*</action> <speech>“I dunno.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Lina struggles to explain her opinion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <speech>“Like, he keeps asking us what we do on the weekend? It’s weird.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Xiaowei tries characterize an opinion with an anecdote)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“And it makes you uncomfortable?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Lina:</speaker> <speech>“Kind of. But it’s more like because he tries too hard? He keeps asking us about ‘apps.’ But no one really wants to talk about it?” </speech><notes>(&larr;Lina tries to clarify opinion with anecdote)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Xiaowei:</speaker> <speech>“Everyone is just silent. It’s kind of funny.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(thoughtfully)</internalaction> <speech>“Hm.”</speech></p> 
    </div>
    
<p>Heather can use humor bushes as a tangible way of thinking about Lina and Xiaowei’s overall opinion of Mr. Myrtle&mdash;since their overall opinion of Mr. Myrtle <em>is</em> their humor bush with him. </p>

<p>Whatever Mr. Myrtle’s motives are, his students feel the size of humor bush he’s trying to grow is unfitted. Taken overall, he wants to <humor-outcome>have <outcome-contrast>strong</outcome-contrast> rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>have a <outcome-contrast>strong</outcome-contrast> ability to open new topics of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> symbolize very close ties</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>frequently</outcome-contrast> deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 

<p>Xiaowei and Lina register this as unfitted&mdash;it’s outside what they think the humor bush dress code should be. And outside of what Mr. Myrtle seems to want, the <sem-weak>actual</sem-weak> humor bush seems unfittedly small. <callback>(“Everyone is just silent.”)</callback></p>

<p>Because of this, they describe the class as off-putting or weird, and censure Mr. Myrtle to Heather.</p>

    <p><headline>Opinions.</headline> 
    When someone doesn’t know how to convey their <term>overall</term> opinion, they sometimes use <term2>specific</term2> anecdotes, complaints, praise, suggestions, and so on. We shouldn’t focus too much on these. Instead, we should use them as guides to their overall opinion.</p> 
    
    <div class="for-instance">
       <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
        <p class="for-instance-text">When Lina shares an anecdote about Mr. Myrtle, she’s trying to convey something about a <sem-weak>year-long</sem-weak> issue about how the class and the teacher relate to each other. The issue isn’t in the <term>anecdote</term>&mdash;the issue is in the <term2>overall</term2> experience, which is broader than just the anecdote.</p> </div>
    
    <p>There are thousands of ways to increase the amount of fitted humor in an experience. <em>Any</em> of them may work to raise an overall opinion.</p> 
    
    <p>But if we fixate on a single anecdote, it suddenly seems like there’s just <term>one</term> place to increase fitted humor&mdash;even though there are actually <term2>many</term2>. This can narrow our understanding of how things can improve&mdash;and at worst, can cause us to miss the forest for the trees.</p> 
    
    <div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
        <p class="for-instance-text">If there was more fitted humor everywhere else in Mr. Myrtle's class, Lina's and Xiaowei's overall opinion of him would improve.</p> 
        
        <p class="for-instance-text">The same anecdotal instance would no longer seem representative of their overall experience. That's because the actual issue isn't in the <term>specific</term> anecdote, but in the lack of fitted humor in <term2>general</term2>.</p>
