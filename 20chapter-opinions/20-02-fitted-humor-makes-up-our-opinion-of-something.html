<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Fitted humor makes up our opinion of something</h1>



<p>If a high school has two math teachers using the same lesson plan, the students won't have the same opinion of both teachers—despite the identical lesson plans.</p>

<p>Instead, the students will have a higher opinion of the teacher that prioritizes humor family words and reaching humor outcomes on relevant topics.</p> 

<p>This will be the teacher that:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>presents the content well, and creates <emotions>insight</emotions></li>
    <li>pushes students the right amount so that they feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions></li>
    <li>validates honest efforts, and helps students feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions></li>
    <li>structures tests well, and allows for feelings of <emotions>success</emotions></li>
    <li>decorates a room well, and allows students to feel <emotions>belonging</emotions></li>
    <li>acknowledges students, and can help them feel <emotions>welcome</emotions></li>
    <li>allows group bonding, and lets students feel <emotions>connection</emotions></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>When students think back to how good or bad the course was, they think about their humor bush—about whether they frequently felt <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. That's because these feelings make up our emotional orientation in our lives.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We probably noticed this about the teachers we’ve liked. Sometimes these were the cool or funny teachers—but not always. More specifically, we tend to like best the ones who best helped us experience humor family words, like <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>
    
     
    
    <p class="considertext">In other words, we preferred teachers with a skill for fitted humor <callback>(charm)</callback>—more so than people with a skill for intense humor <callback>(comedy)</callback>.</p>
</div>


<p>If a class rarely feels fitted humor, they’ll rarely feel <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, and so on—and the lack of humor family words gives students a negative opinion of the course.</p>

<p>We have a good opinion of a class for the same reason we’d have a good opinion of a city—we have a large humor bush with them.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">Sometimes it doesn’t seem accurate to say that humor makes up our opinion of something—in part because we think of humor as <term>comedy</term>. But it makes more sense when we're able to think of humor as <em>charm</em>—as prioritizing fittedness. </p>

<p class="considertext">That's because fittedness is tied to efficiency and cohesion on our emotion network. Our humor bushes are our overall sense of something's ability to modulate efficiency to the circumstances, and keep emotion networks cohesive.</p>

<p class="considertext">This makes up our emotional orientation. All things being equal, we'll prefer something that makes us feel <outcome-contrast>more</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishment</emotions> then less—<outcome-contrast>more</outcome-contrast> <emotions>acceptance</emotions> than less—<outcome-contrast>more</outcome-contrast> <emotions>insight</emotions> than less—and so on. We bundle this orientation together into our personal opinion of something.</p>
 



<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Overall.</headline> When we don’t know how to explain our <term>opinion</term> of things, we often try to explain the <em>content</em> instead. For instance, if we took a long walk and had a <sem>good opinion</sem> of it, we might try to convey this <term>opinion</term> by describing content: the <em>weather</em>, temperature, colors, sounds, and so on.</p>

    <p>But focusing on content isn’t a genuine explanation of our opinions. We know this because even with the same weather, temperature, colors, sounds, we don't always have a good opinion of our walk. So our overall opinion isn't formed by the content by itself—instead, our opinion is our <sem>evaluation</sem> of that content.</p>
    
    <p>We've said our evaluations—mistakes and OKs—lead to emotions, and that these emotions occur in one of three zones. Which zone produces a good opinion of something? Not mistake-predominant or OK-predominant zones—it’s not until we occasionally feel balanced emotions that we start using positive language about our experiences.</p>
    
    <p>When we feel humor family words, we're experiencing <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. It's the presence of these experiences—not the specific weather or sounds by themselves—that lets us characterize the walk as good.</p>
