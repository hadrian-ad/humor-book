<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Fitted humor makes up our opinion of something</h1>



<p>Two math teachers may have identical lesson plans. But even so, that doesn't mean high school students will have the same opinion of the two math teachers.</p>

<p>Instead, the students will have a <sem>higher</sem> opinion of whichever teacher better generated and prioritized fitted humor. This will be the teacher that:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>presents the content well, and creates <emotions>insight</emotions></li>
    <li>pushes students the right amount so that they feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions></li>
    <li>validates honest efforts, and helps students feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions></li>
    <li>structures tests well, and allows for feelings of <emotions>success</emotions></li>
    <li>decorates a room well, and allows students to feel <emotions>belonging</emotions></li>
    <li>acknowledges students, and can help them feel <emotions>welcome</emotions></li>
    <li>allows group bonding, and lets students feel <emotions>connection</emotions></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>When students think back to how good or bad the class was, they'll think about their humor bush—about whether they frequently felt <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">
    Sometimes it doesn’t seem accurate to say that humor makes up our opinion of teachers—in part because we're so used to thinking of <term>comedy</term>. <callback>(Prioritizing <outcome-contrast>intensity</outcome-contrast>.)</callback> But it makes more sense when we're able to think about <em>charm</em>. <callback>(Prioritizing <outcome-contrast>fittedness</outcome-contrast>.)</callback> </p>
    
    
    <p class="considertext">
    <term>Sometimes</term> our favorite teachers were the cool, funny, or outrageous ones—but more <em>specifically</em>, we liked best the teachers who best helped us experience humor family words, like <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. Their ability to do this may or may not have overlapped with our stereopical ideas of being cool, funny, outrageous, and so on.</p> 
     
</div>


<p>If a class <outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> feels fitted humor, they’ll <outcome-contrast>rarely</outcome-contrast> feel <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, and so on—and the lack of humor family words gives students a negative opinion of the course.</p>

<p>We have a good opinion of a <term>class</term> for the same reason we’d have a good opinion of a <em>city</em>—we have a large humor bush with them.</p>

<div class="box">
    
    <p><headline>Orientation.</headline> When humor is above the humor dress code, we see humor as efficient and as building cohesion. This means our humor bushes are our overall sense of someone or something's ability to modulate their actions in a way that is effective and builds group cohesion.</p>
    
    <p>
    
    Our emotional orientation is toward this fitted humor. That's because all things being equal, we  prefer something that makes us feel <outcome-contrast>more</outcome-contrast> <emotions>accomplishment</emotions> then less—<outcome-contrast>more</outcome-contrast> <emotions>acceptance</emotions> than less—<outcome-contrast>more</outcome-contrast> <emotions>insight</emotions> than less—and so on. This orientation toward fitted humor <callback>(efficient and cohesive humor)</callback> is what drives our personal opinion of something.</p> 
    
    <p>If one teacher makes us feel more <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, and <emotions>insight</emotions> than another teacher, we'll have a better opinion of them. Our overall opinion is how much alignment we feel with this emotional orientation.</p>
