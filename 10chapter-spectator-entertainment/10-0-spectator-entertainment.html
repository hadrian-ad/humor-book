<p class="subtitle">Chapter 10</p>
       <p class="overtitle">Spectator Entertainment</p>
       
    </div>


<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at <vocab>spectator entertainment</vocab>&mdash;things that prioritize the emotions of others.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When we perform a play, it doesn't matter how <term>we</term> feel, or how our <term>characters</term> feel&mdash;it matters how the <em>spectators</em> feel.</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">Since the priority is on the spectators, the play is "spectator entertainment."</p> </div>

    <p>To become familiar with this, we can make an analogy to wrestling.</p> 
    
    <p><term>Interpersonal</term> wrestling prioritizes the <term>mutual</term> experience between the wrestlers, while <em>spectator</em> wrestling prioritizes the <em>one-sided</em> experience of watching the wrestlers:</p> 

<ul>
   <li><strong>Interpersonal wrestling</strong> is intense and interesting to <term>participants</term>—but not always as interesting to spectators. Casual spectators might see the wrestlers in odd-looking helmets and uniforms locked in a static grapple for a long time before something happens quickly and the match is over.</li> 
    
    <li><strong>Spectator wrestling</strong> is designed to be intense and interesting to the <em>audience</em>&mdash;and how the wrestlers feel is less important. In order to better commercialize wrestling, showrunners staged and performed scenes in a way that was easy to follow, exciting, visually stimulating, and so on&mdash;for the <sem-weak>audience</sem-weak>.</li>
    </ul>

<p>When generating humor, sometimes the focus is on a <term>mutual</term> experience—we prioritize the humor we feel <term>with</term> someone. But other times, the focus is on the <em>spectator’s</em> experience—we prioritize the humor <em>others</em> feel.</p>

<p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.
