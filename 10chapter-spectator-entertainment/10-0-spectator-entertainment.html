       <p class="overtitle">Spectator Entertainment</p>
       
    </div>


<p>In previous chapters, we looked at emotion networks&mdash;everyone's constant exchange of evaluatory information:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>The Ultimate team practices on the quad. Everyone has to track everyone.</narration></p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes, we can observe an emotion network:</p>

  <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma and Zoe are several stories up, looking through the window at the Ultimate team practice on the quad.</narration></p>
</div>

<p>This is like a one-way mirror, where Emma and Zoe can <term>take in</term> evaluatory information, but their own evaluatory information is <em>screened out</em>:</p>

<p>Sometimes these screens are real, like if we watch a movie or a game live on TV&mdash;there is no way for our evaluations to reach the actors or players we're watching.</p>

 <div class="vignette">
<p>
	
		<narration>Trevor and Yasmin are watching
		        
		        <book-title>Squeal III</book-title>.</narration>
</p>
<p>
	
		<narration>Rosie explores an old mansion at night, and paused before a small jewelry box ominously on the table.</narration>
	
	<speech>“Don’t do it,”</speech>
	
		 <narration>Trevor says, annoyed.
		         
		         
		             Rosie slowly opens the box and a ragged ghost explodes out! </narration>
	
</p>
<p>
	
		<narration>Trevor and Yasmin leap up.</narration>
	
	<speech>“Fuck!!”</speech>
	
		 <narration>Yasmin says, heart thumping. She laughs, hand over her heart.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin feels the jump scare is OK &harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>safety</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	
</p>
<p>
	
		<narration>Trevor has his hands on his head.</narration>
	
	<speech>“Why can’t they just have the monsters and blood without the freaking jump scares?”</speech>
	
		<narration>he says.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels the jump scare is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>safety</emotions-in-notes>&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	
</p>
    </div>
<p>Other times, these screens are pretended&mdash;like when an audience watches a play. Our evaluatory information <sem-weak>does</sem-weak> reach the actors, but they pretend it doesn't:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer are acting in a play. They pretend the audience isn't there. When the audience chuckles, Sam and Jennifer ignore it.</narration></p>
</div>


<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at <vocab>spectator entertainment</vocab>&mdash;things that prioritize the emotions of spectators.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When we perform a play, it doesn't matter how <term>we</term> feel, or how our <term>characters</term> feel&mdash;it matters how the <em>spectators</em> feel.</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">Since the priority is on the spectators, the play is "spectator entertainment."</p> </div>

    <p>To become familiar with this, we can make an analogy to wrestling.</p> 
    
    <p><term>Interpersonal</term> wrestling prioritizes the <term>mutual</term> experience between the wrestlers, while <em>spectator</em> wrestling prioritizes the <em>one-sided</em> experience of watching the wrestlers:</p> 

<ul>
   <li><strong>Interpersonal wrestling</strong> is intense and interesting to <term>participants</term>—but not always as interesting to spectators. Casual spectators might see the wrestlers in odd-looking helmets and uniforms locked in a static grapple for a long time before something happens quickly and the match is over.</li> 
    
    <li><strong>Spectator wrestling</strong> is designed to be intense and interesting to the <em>audience</em>&mdash;and how the wrestlers feel is less important. In order to better commercialize wrestling, showrunners staged and performed scenes in a way that was easy to follow, exciting, visually stimulating, and so on&mdash;for the <sem-weak>audience</sem-weak>.</li>
    </ul>

alt="This comparison shows two variations. In the first column, spectators are watching two people wrestling, who focused on each other. In the second column, spectators are watching two people wrestling who are focused on them."

<p>When generating humor, sometimes the focus is on a <term>mutual</term> experience—we prioritize the humor we feel <term>with</term> someone. But other times, the focus is on the <em>spectator’s</em> experience—we prioritize the humor <em>others</em> feel.</p>

<p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.
