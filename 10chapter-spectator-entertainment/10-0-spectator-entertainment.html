<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at <vocab>spectator entertainment</vocab>. These are things that prioritize the emotions of spectators.</p>

    <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer rehearse for a play.</narration> <notes>(&larr;play is spectator entertainment)</notes></p> 
    </div>

<p>When Sam and Jennifer perform their play, it doesn't matter so much how <term>they</term> feel or how their <term>characters</term> feel&mdash;it matters how their <em>spectators</em> feel.</p>

<p>Since the <sem>priority</sem> is on the experience of the spectators, the play is spectator entertainment.</p> 
   
   <p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.

     <p><headline>Conversion.</headline>      
    We can orient something between ourselves <callback>(interspersonal orientation)</callback> or orient it for others <callback>(spectator orientation)</callback>. This is like the difference between competitive wrestling and dramatized wrestling:</p> 
          
          <ul>
             <li><strong>Competitive wrestling</strong> is intense and interesting to <term>participants</term>—but not always as interesting to <em>spectators</em>. Casual spectators might see the wrestlers in odd-looking helmets and uniforms locked in a static grapple for a long time before something happens quickly and the match is over.</li> 
              
              <li><strong>Dramatized wrestling</strong> is designed to be intense and interesting to the <term>audience</term>&mdash;and how the <em>participants</em> feel is less important. In order to better commercialize wrestling, showrunners staged and performed scenes in a way that was easy to follow, exciting, visually stimulating, and so on&mdash;for the <sem-weak>audience</sem-weak>.</li>
              </ul>
