10. Spectator entertainment
</h1>



<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at <vocab>spectator entertainment</vocab>. Spectator entertainment are things that are premeditated or performed—like movies, books, graphic novels, internet videos, plays, standup, and so on.</p> 

<p>To introduce this idea, we can make an analogy to wrestling. <term>Interpersonal</term> wrestling prioritizes the <em>mutual</em> experience between the wrestlers, while <term>spectator</term> wrestling prioritizes the <em>one-sided</em> experience of watching the wrestlers:</p> 

<ul>
   <li><term>Interpersonal wrestling</term> is intense and interesting to <em>participants</em>—but not always as interesting to spectators. Casual spectators might see the wrestlers in odd-looking helmets and uniforms locked in a static grapple for a long time before something happens quickly and the match is over.</li> 
    
    <li><term>Spectator wrestling</term> was a commercialization of wrestling. Showrunners expanded who might enjoy watching wrestling by oriented everything around the enjoyment of the <em>audience</em>. Matches were staged and performed for spectators in a way that was easy to follow, exciting, visually stimulating, and so on.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Something similar happens with generating humor. Sometimes the focus is on mutual experience—we prioritize the humor <term>we</term> feel with someone. But other times, the focus is on the spectator’s experience—we prioritize the humor <em>others</em> feel.</p>

<p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.
