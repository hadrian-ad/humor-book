10. Spectator entertainment
</h1>



<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at “spectator entertainment.” Spectator entertainment are things that are premeditated or performed—like movies, books, graphic novels, internet videos, plays, standup, and so on.</p> 

<p>There's an "interpersonal" template and a "spectator" template to how we generate humor. To introduce this idea, we can make an analogy to wresting.</p> 

<p>Interpersonal wrestling prioritizes the mutual experience between the wrestlers, while spectator wrestling prioritizes the experience of the spectators:</p> 

<ul>
   <li>Interpersonal wrestling. Interpersonal wrestling is intense and interesting to participants—but not always as interesting to spectators. Casual spectators might see the wrestlers in odd-looking helmets and uniforms locked in a static grapple for a long time before something happens quickly and the match is over.</li> 
    
    <li>Spectator wrestling. In order to commercialize wrestling by expanding who might enjoy watching it, showrunners developed spectator wrestling—which oriented everything around the enjoyment of the audience. Matches were staged and performed in a way that was easy to follow, exciting, visually stimulating, and so on. Whether the performers enjoyed it was neither here nor there—what mattered most was that the audience enjoyed it.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Something similar happens with generating humor. Sometimes the focus is on mutual experience—we prioritize the humor we feel with someone. But other times, the focus is on the spectator’s experience—we prioritize the humor others feel.</p>

<p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.
