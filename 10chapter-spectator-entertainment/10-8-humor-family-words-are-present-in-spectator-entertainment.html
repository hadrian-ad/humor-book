<p>Above, Trevor and Duke "match"&mdash;they're both feeling <emotions>achievement</emotions> at the same time. This makes it easy for us to think of our humor as humor family words.</p> 
    
<p>But even when things don't match, we can still describe our humor with humor family words:</p>
      
      
      <div class="vignette">

<p>Since Lina and Xiaowei don't match emotions with Rosie, they may be tempted to describe their humor as a feeling of <emotions>danger</emotions> <callback>(like Rosie is feeling)</callback>. But they're actually feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>!</p>
      
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
          <p class="considertext">It's not surprising that  Lina and Xiaowei might feel <emotions>safety</emotions> watching someone <term>pretend</term> to be chased by a <term>fake</term> alien parasite, even at the same time they'd feel <emotions>danger</emotions> if they were watching someone <em>actually</em> be chased by a <em>real</em> alien parasite.</p>
          </div>

 <p>We can see this same outcomes of spectator templates elsewhere:</p>

<p>Sometimes we read about hard work and wonder why it feels good&mdash;but Zoe isn't actually doing hard work. She's instead feeling <emotions>comfort</emotions> from the book. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback>

      <img class="img-indent"
       
       src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-8-humor-family-words-are-present/10-8-2-hard-work.sketchpad.png"
        title="Novel involving hard work"
alt="This interaction template shows the character and work horse on one side of the screen, and Zoe reading on the other. An annotation says it's not surprising that the emotional reactions on either end of the screen don't match."
style="max-width: 23rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: "
>

<p>When we think about it, it's not surprising that reading about something has a different emotional outcome than actually experiencing it. They're completely different!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We don't read about a feast and then wonder why we're still hungry. Even so, we sometimes read about something terrible and then wonder why we're laughing!</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">But in the same way reading about a feast isn't eating, reading about something terrible isn't suffering through it. It's not surprising these have different emotional reactions</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Even so, we sometimes see people ask things like <callback>"why does this terrible thing make me laugh?"</callback>&mdash;when the more accurate question is <callback>"why does <sem>reading</sem> about this terrible thing make me laugh?"</callback>
    </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">To make this question answerable, we can drop the "terrible" and then replace "laugh" with a humor family words: <callback>"Why does reading about this thing make me feel <emotions>safety</emotions> (<emotions>comfort, connection, relief,</emotions> or so on)?"</callback></p> 
</div>

<!--
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">When Trevor laughs after being scared while taking out the dog, and Lina and Xiaowei laugh after being scared while watching a horror movie—the shared experience was <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This lets us avoid fixating on content. Instead of asking infinite <term>content</term> questions <callback>"why do we laugh at alien parasites?"</callback>, <callback>"why do we laugh after being spooked"</callback>, and so on&mdash;we can ask a <outcome-contrast>few</outcome-contrast> <em>emotional</em> question instead. <callback>("Why do we laugh at safety?")</callback></p> 
    </div>

<p>It's also not surprising that the surface content is sometimes unimportant. When Zoe <term>reads</term> a book that has hard work in it, she's not <em>doing</em> hard work. So the question isn't <callback>"why is hard work funny?"</callback>—it's actually <callback>"why is <strong>reading</strong> about hard work funny?"</callback></p> 

  
<p>Zoe isn't evaluating the abstract idea of "hard work." Instead, she's having a personal relation to the book's contrasts, contexts, presentation, and so on. It's these things that shift  Zoe's mistakes and OK into balance. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback></p>

    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Wink and a nod.</headline> We're sometimes surprised that so many movies advertised as "scary" aren't really scary—but we're only surprised when we're taking advertising at face value.</p> 
  
<p>So even though <i>Squeal IV</i> sells itself as scary, its appeal to teenagers isn't actually <term>scariness</term>—it’s appeal is that it generates <em>humor</em>. Any scariness is just a means to an ends: of feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
   
<p>We know this for all kinds of reasons. If scariness alone was appealing, then children scared to their core by adult movies would enjoy the experience—but they don’t. Similarly, if goriness alone was appealing, then adults would love watching gory war footage—but they don't. 

<p>That’s because neither scariness nor gore is the appeal of scary movies—the appeal is humor. This is why so many horror movies are campy and cliche. When humor <outcome-contrast>isn't</outcome-contrast> present, scariness and gore isn't appealing.</p>

<p>If someone <sem>doesn't</sem> feel humor from jump scares, they'd rather do almost anything than watch movies built around them. Of course, even if they'd never watch them alone, they may watch them with friends if they think the film will allow them to together have emotional experiences of <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>
   
    </div>

    <div class="chapter-end">
    <p>That's the end of this chapter! Next, we'll see how spectator entertainment have their own humor profiles.</p>
</div>


  
    
        <button type="button" class="collapsible-example">
    
    A deeper look (Money)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">

  <p>Spectator entertainment is often commercialized&mdash;which means that there's a priority for maximizing money somewhere in the production chain. Commercialization gives things design priorities that shape how they turn out.</p> 

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to hotels, since commercialization shapes how hotels are built. For instance, architects are told that the hotel rooms should:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>be easy to clean</li>
    <li>be durable</li>
    <li>be inoffensive</li>
    <li>have an orderly and efficient arrangement</li>
    <li>not be more expensively furnished then necessary</li>
    <li>reduce theft</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This helps us understand part of why hotel rooms look like hotel rooms, and not like someone’s bedroom. In our bedroom, we can put whatever art we like on the walls&mdash;since we're not worried someone will steal it or give them a bad review, like we might if decorating a hotel.</p> 

<p>Something similar happens to when humor is a goal of something commercialized. The commercialization gives design priorities to things like movies or comedians, where the creators may then try to:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>appeal to a broad audience</li>
    <li>be a conventional length</li>
    <li>be accessible to many people</li>
    <li>be reproducible</li>
    <li>fit an advertising model</li>
    <li>not allow disruptive interaction from the audience</li>
    <li>represent the distributor or host</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>This explains in part why a funny clip from a <term>comedy</term> and a funny video from our <em>partner</em> aren't similar. In part, that’s because our partner isn’t shaped by any commercial priorities!</p> 

<p>Our partner can focus entirely on us alone, without worrying about whether they'll also appeal to a broad audience or if they'll fit with an advertising model. It's similar to how a residential bedroom can look different than a hotel bedroom&mdash;the goals and priorities are different.</p> 

<p>Our partner can also activate topics specific to just us, in a way a video designed for hundreds of thousands of people can't.</p>


<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If a movie is trying to reach tens of millions of people, it has design priorities that will screen out niche content.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We won’t see a blockbuster <term>movie</term> that makes a joke about a restaurant in our hometown&mdash;let alone about a gift we once got during a birthday dinner there.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">However, our <em>partner</em> may activate these topics&mdash;which is one reason people can provide things in conversation that we can't get from things with more commercialized design priorities.</p> 
</div>

<p>We’re often aware of the upsides and downsides of <vocab>scaling</vocab>, like for rented rooms. We intuitively know this when thinking about staying in a Bed &amp; Breakfast with three rooms or a resort with 1,000 rooms.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">The resort may have efficiencies of scale, so their 1,000 rooms can support a water park and commercial kitchens&mdash;while a three-room bed and breakfast can’t.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">At the same time, the resort will be unable to have an entrance that's cozy, delicate, detailed, distinctive, small, textured, unique, and so on&mdash;since there's just too many people coming in and out!</p> </div>

<p>But even though we're used to thinking this way for things like <term>hotels</term>, we sometimes aren't used to thinking this way for <em>spectator entertainment</em>&mdash;which is often similar.</p> 
 
 
 <p>A comedic movie for ten million people is very different then a small open mic night for ten listeners&mdash;which is itself different than a conversation with our partner.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
     <p class="considertext">We may wonder why people may go to local comedy open mics. There are many reasons&mdash;one of which is that we can get local references or characteristics in ways we simply can't from other spectator entertainment!</p>
     </div>
 <p>The point here isn't to say that commercialization or scalability is bad, since it's not&mdash;those things can be good or bad. Instead, the point is to notice the reasons that spectater entertainment is the way it is. This lets us be thoughtful about how these things relate to our day-to-day lives.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We may enjoy going to a hotel for a vacation. But it wouldn't make sense to think that because we enjoyed it hotel rooms are how <sem>all</sem> bedrooms everywhere should be.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">It's the same for comedic books or movies. We may enjoy them&mdash;but at the same time, it's not something that defines how all moments of humor should be everywhere.</p>
   

</div>

<!--
<p>This can help us think about why people may <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to go to small humor-generating environments, like a local comedy club, improv show, open mic night, regional film festival, underground theater, and so on—even if those things seem unappealing to us.</p> 

<p>People enjoy going to them for the same reason people like going to art films, indie bands, indie games, niche artists, small content creators, and so on—the less commercialized things are, the less they’re shaped by commercial design constraints.</p>

<p>The people who attend these things often experience them as authentic, cutting-edge, fresh, raw, relevant, resonant, vivid, or so on—it’s the same for a local artist or band as for a small-time humorist.</p> 


    <p class="for-instance-text">This is part of the appeal of user-generated content on forums as well, like memes, which allow for low-cost sharing of small-scale spectator entertainment.
    
      local humorist may make jokes about that specific restaurant—which provides something we won’t get from something more  commercialized.
    </p>
    

<p>Finally, the chance to <sem-weak>be</sem-weak> somewhere gives us a richer range of active topics and different bookending experiences of arriving and leaving.</p>
