Humor family words are present in spectator entertainment

<p>We feel <a href="../7chapter-humor-family-words/7-0-humor-family-words.html#exclude-navigation">humor family words</a> from spectator entertainment:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor is watching Star Battles.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Duke Dirtfarmer is flying through the evil valley, pursued by evil spacecraft. Duke has one chance. The music swells. Trevor tenses. Duke launches his proton lancers—and they hit! The evil base is destroyed.</narration></p>

    <p><narration>Emma and Owen are watching Blood Soul Revenge. Guys on horses fight guys on motorcycles; guys with swords fight women with scythes; one old guy uses an abacus as his main weapon, and constantly adds up the number of guys he’s killed on it.

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is reading Peace is a Gentle Mountain, and the writing is so calm and relaxing. The characters have a hard life, drawing water from wells and caring for livestock, but everything seems so beautiful and reflective. Zoe smiles lightly as she reads.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels comfort&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

<p>Sometimes our humor family words "match" what's shown on spectator entertainment—like when Trevor feels <emotions>achievement</emotions> at the same time Duke feels <emotions>achievement</emotions>.</p>

<p>But other times, our humor family words <sem>don't</sem> seem to match the spectator entertainment—like how Zoe feels <emotions>comfort</emotions> from reading about hard work, or Lina and Xiaowei feel <emotions>safety</emotions> while someone is in the same building as an alien parasite.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that  Lina and Xiaowei might feel <emotions>safety</emotions> watching someone <term>pretend</term> to be chased by a fake alien parasite, even at the same time they'd feel <emotions>danger</emotions> if they were watching someone <em>actually</em> be chased by a real alien parasite.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This helps us see the similarity between moments of humor. When Trevor laughs <sem>after</sem> being scared while taking out the dog, and Lina and Xiaowei laugh <sem>after</sem> being scared while watching a horror movie—the shared experience was <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This lets us avoid fixating on content. Instead of asking infinite <term>content</term> questions <callback>"why do we laugh at alien parasites?"</callback> and <callback>"why do we laugh after being spooked"</callback> we can instead ask one <em>emotional</em> question. <callback>("Why do we laugh at safety"</callback> or <callback>"why did someone feel safe right then?")</callback></p> 
    
    </div>



<p>It's also not surprising that the surface content is sometimes unimportant. When Zoe <term>reads</term> a book that has hard work in it, she's not <em>doing</em> hard work <callback>("why is hard work funny?")</callback>—she's reading a book. <callback>("why is <strong>reading</strong> about hard work funny?")</callback></p> 

<p>There are contrasts, context, and presentation to the book that shift Zoe's mistakes and OK into balance. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback> The abstract idea of "hard work" is otherwise neither here nor there when it comes to humor.</p>



    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Wink and a nod.</headline> We're sometimes surprised that movies advertised as "scary" aren't really scary—but we're only surprised because we're taking advertising at face value.</p> 
  
<p>So even though <i>Squeal IV</i> sells itself as scary, its appeal to teenagers isn't scariness—it’s that it generates humor. Any scariness is just a means to an ends: of feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>, of feeling humor.</p>
   
<p>We know this for all kinds of reasons. If scariness alone was appealing, then children scared to their core by adult movies would enjoy the experience—but they don’t. Similarly, if goriness alone was appealing, then adults would love watching gory war footage—but they don't. 

<p>That’s because neither scariness nor gore is the appeal of scary movies—the appeal is humor. <callback>("Why are horror movies so campy and cliche?")</callback> When humor isn't present, scariness and gore isn't appealing.</p>

<p>If someone <sem>doesn't</sem> feel humor from jump scares, they'd rather do almost anything than watch movies built around them. Of course, even if they'd never watch them alone, they may watch them with friends if they think the film will allow the group to feel emotional experiences of <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>Usually an emotional system has mutual priorities and reactivity. But when an emotional system's priority is someone's emotional state, it's "spectator entertainment."</p>

<ul>
   <li>Spectator entertainment is surreal. We often think of comedies as representing real life—but they're as surreal as an action film.</li>
    
    <li>While humor is always produced by the same process of mistakes and OKs, that same process can lead to different outcomes depending on whether we're acting, spectating, or in mutual interactions.</li>
    
    <li>Surreal things often scramble our usual associations between content and humor family words. It's not until we pay closer attention that we see the universality of humor family words.
