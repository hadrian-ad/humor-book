Humor family words are present in spectator entertainment
</h1>


<p>We feel <a href="../7chapter-humor-family-words/7-0-humor-family-words.html#exclude-navigation">humor family words</a> from spectator entertainment:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor is watching Star Battles.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Duke Dirtfarmer is flying through the evil valley, pursued by evil spacecraft. Duke has one chance. The music swells. Trevor tenses. Duke launches his proton lancers—and they hit! The evil base is destroyed.</narration></p>
     
     <p><narration>Trevor smiles with relief.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels achievement, relief&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

    <p><narration>Emma and Owen are watching Blood Soul Revenge. Guys on horses fight guys on motorcycles; guys with swords fight women with scythes; one old guy uses an abacus as his main weapon, and constantly adds up the number of guys he’s killed on it. There’s just so much great stuff!</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma and Owen feel generosity&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is reading Peace is a Gentle Mountain, and the writing is so calm and relaxing. The characters have a hard life, drawing water from wells and caring for livestock, but everything seems so beautiful and reflective.

<p>Sometimes our humor family words "match" the spectator entertainment—like when Trevor feels <emotions>achievement</emotions> at the same time the Duke feels <emotions>achievement</emotions>.</p>

<p>But other times, our humor family words <em>don't</em> seem to match the spectator entertainment—like how Zoe feels <emotions>comfort</emotions> from reading about hard work, or Lina and Xiaowei feel <emotions>safety</emotions> from someone being chased by an alien parasite.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that our emotions don't always match the surface content in spectator entertainment.</p>

<p>For one, Zoe feels humor from the contrasts, context, and presentation of the hard work—not from "hard work" itself, as an abstract concept. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback></p>

<p>For another, we've seen throughout this chapter how evaluations depending on our relation to things. It's not surprising that Lina and Xiaowei might feel <emotions>safety</emotions> watching someone pretend to be chased by a fake alien parasite, even at the same time they'd feel <emotions>danger</emotions> if they were actually chased by a real alien parasite.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This helps us see the similarity between moments of humor. When Trevor laughs after being scared while taking out the dog, and Lina and Xiaowei laugh after being scared while watching a horror movie—the shared experience was <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
    
<p class="considertext">This lets us avoid fixating on content. Instead of asking <callback>"why do we laugh at alien parasites?"</callback> we can ask "why do we laugh at safety" or <callback>"why did someone feel safe right then?"</callback></p>

    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>We're sometimes surprised that movies advertised as "scary" aren't really scary—but that's just taking advertising at face value. Even though <i>Squeal IV</i> sells itself as scary, its appeal to teenagers isn't scariness—it’s that it generates humor. Any scariness is just a means to an ends: of feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>, of feeling humor.</p>
   
<p>We know this for all kinds of reasons. If scariness alone was appealing, then children scared to their core by adult movies would enjoy the experience—but they don’t. Similarly, if goriness alone was appealing, then adults would love watching gory war footage—but they don't. That’s because neither scariness nor gore is the appeal—the appeal is humor. <callback>("Why are horror movies so campy and cliche?")</callback> When humor <em>isn't</em> absent, scariness and gore isn't appealing.</p>

<p>If someone doesn't feel humor from jump scares, they'd rather do almost anything than watch movies built around them. Of course, even if they'd never watch them alone, they may be enticed to watch them with friends if they hope the film will allow the group to feel emotional experiences of <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>
