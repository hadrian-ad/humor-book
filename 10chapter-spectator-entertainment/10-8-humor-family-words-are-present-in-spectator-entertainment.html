Humor family words are present in spectator entertainment
</h1>


<p>We feel humor family words from spectator entertainment—but they don't always look like they do in our day-to-day life:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Trevor is watching Star Battles.</p>
    
    <p>Duke Dirtfarmer is flying through the evil valley, pursued by evil spacecraft. Duke has one chance. The music swells. Trevor tenses. Duke launches his proton lancers—and they hit! The evil base is destroyed. Trevor smiles with relief. (&larr;Trevor feels achievement, relief&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>
    
     </div>
     
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Emma and Owen are watching Blood Soul Revenge. Guys on horses fight guys on motorcycles; guys with swords fight women with scythes; one old guy uses an abacus as his main weapon, and constantly adds up the number of guys he’s killed on it. There’s just so much great stuff! (&larr;Emma and Owen feel generosity&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>
    
     </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Xiaowei’s pirated Squeal IV, and he and Lina are watching in in the dark.</p>
    
    <p>Father Daniel: *condescendingly* “Listen, Rosie. Those things you saw. They aren’t real. You know that, right?” *smiles*</p>
    
    <p>Rosie: “Yes. I know that know. Thank you, father.”</p>
    
    <p>Daniel: “Anything, my daughter.”</p>
    
    <p>Rosie: *hesitates*</p>
    
    <p>Daniel: “Yes?”</p>
    
    <p>Rosie: “Father, maybe you can tell me something. The man who came last week.” *camera slowly zooms in on Daniel’s face* “The man in black. I need to know something. Was he...”</p>
    
    <p>Daniel: “BLAHH!” *parasite bursts from head*</p>
    
    <p>Lina and Xiaowei both jump.</p>
    
    <p>Lina: (startled) “Fucker!”</p>
    
    <p>Xiaowei: (startled) “Goddamn it!”
        </p>    
    <p>Rosie screams as the parasite chitters around the ground and grabs her jeans with its spiky mouth. She kicks it and runs gets into another room, slamming the door and locking the parasite in, sobbing uncontrollably.</p> 
    
    <p>Lina and Xiaowei giggle. (&larr;Lina and Xioawei feel safety&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>Zoe is reading Peace is a Gentle Mountain, and the writing is so calm and relaxing. The characters have a hard life, drawing water from wells and caring for livestock, but everything seems so beautiful and reflective. Zoe smiles lightly as she reads. (&larr;Zoe feels comfort&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>
    </div>
    
<p>When Zoe feels humor from Peace is a Gentle Mountain, it’s not because she would necessarily feel humor drawing water and raising livestock herself. Instead, she feels comfort from reading the dialogue and descriptions; encountering the themes; taking a break to read the book; and so on. The content (heavy labor) was neither here nor there to her humor.</p>

<p>When Emma and Owen feel humor from Blood Soul Revenge, it’s not because they think a real life scythe-fight would make them laugh. Instead, they felt generosity because the movie continually seemed to go above and beyond what it had to. </p>

<p>Similarly, when Lina and Xiaowei watch Squeal IV and laugh, it's not because of the monster per se—but because they felt safety.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This helps us see the similarity between moments of humor. Trevor laughed when he ran back indoors after taking the dog out—Lina and Xiaowei laughed when they watched a horror movie. The shared experience here is that they felt safety—they felt humor.</p>

    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>Sometimes we take advertising at face value—like how Squeal IV sells itself as scary, so we think the appeal must be scariness. But the appeal of Squeal IV to teenagers isn’t that it’s scary—it’s more specifically that teenagers hope the overall experience will generate humor. Any scariness would be a means to an end—of safety, of humor.</p>
   
<p>We know this for all kinds of reasons. If scariness alone was the goal, then children scared to their core by adult movies would enjoy the experience—but they don’t. Similarly, adults that like gory movies don’t enjoy the experience of watching gory war footage. That’s because neither scariness nor gore is the appeal—the appeal is humor. When humor is absent, scariness and gore isn't appealing.</p>

<p>If we don’t feel humor from jump scares, we’d rather do anything than watch movies built around them. But even if we’d never watch them alone, we might be enticed to watch these films with friends if we hope the film will allow emotional experiences of connection, belonging, relief, safety, and so on.</p>
