<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is reading Peace is a Gentle Mountain, and the writing is so calm and relaxing.

<p>Sometimes our humor family words "match" what's shown on spectator entertainment—like when Trevor feels <emotions>achievement</emotions> at the same time Duke feels <emotions>achievement</emotions>.</p>

<p>But other times, our humor family words <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> seem to match the spectator entertainment, like how Zoe feels <emotions>comfort</emotions> from reading about hard work—or Lina and Xiaowei feel <emotions>safety</emotions> while someone is in the same building as an alien parasite.</p>

<p>It's not surprising that  Lina and Xiaowei might feel <emotions>safety</emotions> watching someone <term>pretend</term> to be chased by a fake alien parasite, even at the same time they'd feel <emotions>danger</emotions> if they were watching someone <em>actually</em> be chased by a real alien parasite.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This helps us see the similarity between moments of humor. When Trevor laughs <sem>after</sem> being scared while taking out the dog, and Lina and Xiaowei laugh <sem>after</sem> being scared while watching a horror movie—the shared experience was <emotions>safety</emotions>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This lets us avoid fixating on content. Instead of asking <outcome-contrast>infinite</outcome-contrast> <term>content</term> questions <callback>"why do we laugh at alien parasites?"</callback> and <callback>"why do we laugh after being spooked"</callback> we can instead ask a <outcome-contrast>few</outcome-contrast> <em>emotional</em> question. <callback>("Why do we laugh at safety"</callback></p> 
    </div>


<p>It's also not surprising that the surface content is sometimes unimportant. When Zoe <term>reads</term> a book that has hard work in it, she's not <em>doing</em> hard work. So the question isn't <callback>"why is hard work funny?"</callback>—it's actually <callback>"why is <strong>reading</strong> about hard work funny?"</callback></p>

<p>Zoe isn't evaluating the abstract idea of "hard work." Instead, she's having a personal relation to the book's contrasts, contexts, presentation, and so on. It's these things that shift  Zoe's mistakes and OK into balance. <callback>("The writing is so calm and relaxing.")</callback></p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Even though we don't read about a feast and then wonder why we're still hungry, we sometimes read about something terrible and then wonder why we're laughing.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">But they're both not comparable experiences, so it's not surprising that reading about something has different outcomes than actually experiencing it.</p>
</div>



    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Wink and a nod.</headline> We're sometimes surprised that movies advertised as "scary" aren't really scary—but we're only surprised because we're taking advertising at face value.</p> 
  
<p>So even though <i>Squeal IV</i> sells itself as scary, its appeal to teenagers isn't scariness—it’s that it generates humor. Any scariness is just a means to an ends: of feeling <emotions>safety</emotions>, of feeling humor.</p>
   
<p>We know this for all kinds of reasons. If scariness alone was appealing, then children scared to their core by adult movies would enjoy the experience—but they don’t. Similarly, if goriness alone was appealing, then adults would love watching gory war footage—but they don't. 

<p>That’s because neither scariness nor gore is the appeal of scary movies—the appeal is humor. <callback>("Why are horror movies so campy and cliche?")</callback> When humor isn't present, scariness and gore isn't appealing.</p>

<p>If someone <sem>doesn't</sem> feel humor from jump scares, they'd rather do almost anything than watch movies built around them. Of course, even if they'd never watch them alone, they may watch them with friends if they think the film will allow the group to have emotional experiences of <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

    <div class="chapter-end">
    <p>That's the end of this chapter! Next, we'll see how spectator entertainment have their own humor profiles.</p>
</div>

    A deeper look (Money)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">

  <p>Humor in spectator entertainment is often commercialized&mdash;which means that there's a priority for maximizing money somewhere in the creative chain. When things are commercialized, they have design priorities that shape how they turn out.</p> 

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to hotels, where the commercialization <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> has design priorities that shapes how hotels are built.</p>

 <p>For instance, architects are told that the hotel rooms should:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>be easy to clean</li>
    <li>be durable</li>
    <li>be inoffensive</li>
    <li>have an orderly and efficient arrangement</li>
    <li>not be more expensively furnished then necessary</li>
    <li>reduce theft</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This helps us understand part of why hotel rooms look like hotel rooms, and not like someone’s bedroom. In our bedroom, we can put whatever art we like on the walls&mdash;since we're not worried someone will steal it or give them a bad review, like in a hotel.</p> 

<p>Something similar happens to when humor is part of commercialization. The commercialization gives design priorities to things like movies or comedians.</p>  

<p>The creators may then have to:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>appeal to a broad audience</li>
    <li>be a conventional length</li>
    <li>be accessible to many people</li>
    <li>be reproducible</li>
    <li>fit an advertising model</li>
    <li>not allow disruptive interaction from the audience</li>
    <li>represent the distributor or host</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>This explains in part why a funny clip from a <term>comedy</term> and a funny video from our <em>partner</em> aren't similar. In part, that’s because our partner isn’t shaped by any commercial priorities!</p> 

<p>Our partner can focus entirely on us, without worrying about whether they'll also appeal to a broad audience or if they'll fit with an advertising model. It's similar to how a residential bedroom can look different than a hotel bedroom, because the goals and priorities are different.</p> 

<p>Our partner can also activate topics specific to just us, in a way a video designed for hundreds of thousands of people can't.</p>


<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If a movie is trying to reach tens of millions of people, it has design priorities that will screen out niche content. We won’t see a blockbuster movie that makes a joke about a restaurant in our hometown, let alone about a gift we once got during a birthday dinner we had there.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">However, our <sem-weak>partner</sem-weak> may activate these topics&mdash;one reason people in conversation can provide things we can't get from things with more commercialized design priorities.</p> 
</div>

<p>We’re often aware of the upsides and downsides of for-profit things, like hotels. Often, the upsides and downsides are proportional to scale. A resort with 1,000 rooms has a different scaling factor of commercialization than a bed and breakfast with three rooms.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">The resort may have efficiencies of scale, so their 1,000 rooms can support a water park and huge commercial kitchens—while a three-room bed and breakfast can’t.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">At the same time, the resort will be unable to have an entrance that's cozy, delicate, detailed, distinctive, small, textured, unique, and so on—since there's just too many people coming in and out!</p> </div>

<p>But even though we're used to thinking this way for things like <term>hotels</term>, we sometimes aren't used to thinking this way for <em>spectator entertainment</em>&mdash;which is often similarly for-profit, with upsides and downsides as the commercialization scales up and down. A comedic movie for ten million people is very different then a small open mic night for ten listeners is different than a conversation with our partner.</p>

 <p>The point here isn't to say that commercialization is bad, since it's not&mdash;it can be good or bad. Instead, the point is to notice why some spectater entertainment is the way it is, which lets us be thoughtful about how these things relate to our day-to-day lives.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We may enjoy going to a hotel for a vacation. But it wouldn't make sense to think that everything about a hotel room was how <sem>all</sem> bedrooms everywhere should be.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">It's the same for comedic books or movies. We may enjoy them&mdash;but at the same time, it's not something that defines how all moments of humor should be everywhere.</p>
   

</div>

<!--
<p>This can help us think about why people may <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> to go to small humor-generating environments, like a local comedy club, improv show, open mic night, regional film festival, underground theater, and so on—even if those things seem unappealing to us.</p> 

<p>People enjoy going to them for the same reason people like going to art films, indie bands, indie games, niche artists, small content creators, and so on—the less commercialized things are, the less they’re shaped by commercial design constraints.</p>

<p>The people who attend these things often experience them as authentic, cutting-edge, fresh, raw, relevant, resonant, vivid, or so on—it’s the same for a local artist or band as for a small-time humorist.</p> 


    <p class="for-instance-text">This is part of the appeal of user-generated content on forums as well, like memes, which allow for low-cost sharing of small-scale spectator entertainment.
    
      local humorist may make jokes about that specific restaurant—which provides something we won’t get from something more  commercialized.
    </p>
    

<p>Finally, the chance to <sem-weak>be</sem-weak> somewhere gives us a richer range of active topics and different bookending experiences of arriving and leaving.</p>

<p>By default, our emotional system is mutually reactive to all participants. However, we can agree to prioritize just a few members of an emotional system&mdash;what we're calling "spectator entertainment."</p>

<ul>
   <li>Spectator entertainment is <a href="10-0-spectator-entertainment.html">surreal</a>. We often think of comedies as mirrors of real life—but they're not.</li>
    
    <li>Actors, spectators, and characters can all have <a href="10-7-we-can-also-include-actors-as-a-group.html">different evaluations</a>. In spectator entertainment, the goal is foremost on the spectators.</li>
    
    <li>
    Surreal things often scramble our <a href="10-8-humor-family-words-are-present-in-spectator-entertainment.html">usual associations</a> between content and humor family words&mdash;we can feel <emotions>comfort</emotions> by watching others feel hardship.
