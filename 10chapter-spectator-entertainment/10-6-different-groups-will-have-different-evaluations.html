Different groups will have different evaluations
</h1>


<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to think about why the characters and spectators have different emotional outcomes:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>The farmers give the hockey players a barrage of insults. (&larr;large mistake) The hockey players are stunned. (&larr;hockey players have small OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor) Owen laughs. (&larr;Owen has large OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p></div>

    <p>Sam walks into the kitchen and puts hand on Jennifer’s shoulder. He sees her bagel without cream cheese.</p>  
    
    <p>Sam: (surprised) “Oh, it’s the thing.” (&larr;medium mistake)</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: *laughs* “Well, I wouldn’t just... you know…”</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *laughs* *sits down* “Of course not!”</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: *amused* “One of these days…” *gestures*</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *smiles* (ironically wistful) “One day…” (&larr;Sam and Jennifer feel medium mistake has medium OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

<p>We can use the same method to think about why some surreal content makes us laugh, but similar non-surreal content doesn’t:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p>Sam watches Fired Fireman 3 on his laptop. Chief is trying to get the household ready for school, but he’s comically inept at it. As he runs to get the doorbell, he slips on a toy car left on the stairs. Sam loves the slapstick in these things. (&larr;Sam feels humor)</p>
    
    <p class="vig-or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p>Sam watches Jennifer slip on a toy car left on the stairs. His heart wrenches in fear. (&larr;Sam doesn’t feel humor)</p>
    </div>

<p>While these diverging outcomes happen everywhere in our lives, they’re often especially divergent in spectator entertainment. A character in a movie can get hit by a bus, making the audience laugh—but not make the characters laugh.</p>



<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Being coherent and surreal.</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">
    
<p>Spectator entertainment can be emotionally coherent while still being emotionally surreal.</p> 

<p>When we watch spectator entertainment, we suspend our disbelief to assume the emotional premises. This means we take the characters’ evaluations at face value—but these premises and evaluations are still often surreal.</p> 

<p>This is familiar with action scenes. If Rage Man punches through concrete in the opening scene of Blood Soul Revenge, we suspend disbelief to assume that this is something he can do. This makes his feats of strength throughout the movie coherent—but still surreal.</p> 

<p>This happens with comedy scenes as well—if we suspend our disbelief to assume Jennifer had a small mistake when Sam laid across the table, her coolness toward him is coherent. (She had a small mistake and large OK.) But that doesn’t mean it’s not surreal—since if Sam suddenly laid across the table in real life, Jennifer would be confused or upset. (She'd have a large mistake and small OK.)</p>

<p>It's the same for the show with the Canadian farmers and athletes. It's emotionally coherent, in that if we suspend disbelief to take their evaluations at face value, it conforms to our model of humor. But that doesn't mean this is how farmers and athletes would really behave in a similar situation. Being emotionally coherent doesn't mean something is emotionally realistic.</p>
