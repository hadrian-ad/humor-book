Different groups will have different evaluations

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to think about why the characters and spectators have different emotional outcomes:</p>

<p><narration>The farmers give the hockey players a barrage of insults.</narration> <notes>(&larr;large mistake)</notes> <narration>The hockey players are stunned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;hockey players have small OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes> <narration>Owen laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen has large OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p></div>

<p>We can use the same method to think about why some surreal content makes us laugh, but similar non-surreal content doesn’t:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Sam watches Fired Fireman 3 on his laptop. Chief is trying to get the household ready for school, but he’s comically inept at it. As he runs to get the doorbell, he slips on a toy car left on the stairs. Sam loves the slapstick in these things.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>Sam watches Jennifer slip on a toy car left on the stairs. His heart wrenches in fear.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam doesn’t feel humor)</notes></p>
    </div>

<p>While these diverging outcomes happen everywhere in our lives, they’re often <em>especially</em> divergent in spectator entertainment. The audience might laugh when a movie character gets hit by a bus—but that doesn't mean the characters laugh.</p>



<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Being coherent and surreal.</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">
    
<p>Spectator entertainment can be emotionally <term>coherent</term> while still being emotionally <term>surreal</term>.</p> 

<p>This is familiar with action movies, where people have fantastic abilities. When Rage Man punches through concrete in the opening scene of <i>Blood Soul Revenge</i>, the audience assumes this premise. This makes his feats of strength throughout the movie <term>coherent</term>—but still <term>surreal</term>.</p> 

<p>This happens with <em>emotions</em> too. When Jennifer acts in a play, her character is presented as unflappably composed and self-posessed. This makes her coolness to Sam laying across the table emotionally <em>coherent</em> <callback>(she had a small mistake and large OK)</callback> while still being emotionally <em>surreal</em>—since if Sam suddenly laid across the table in real life, Jennifer would be confused or upset. <callback>(She'd have a large mistake and small OK.)</callback></p>

<p>Being emotionally coherent doesn't mean something is emotionally realistic—for the same reason punching through concrete can be physically coherent without being physically realistic. Mistakes and OKs can behave coherently in movies, even when the evaluatory premises are surreal.</p>
