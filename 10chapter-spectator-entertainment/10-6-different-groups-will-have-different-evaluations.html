Evaluations are different for different groups

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to think about why the <term>characters</term> and <em>spectators</em> have different emotional outcomes:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Owen watches a clip from a show.</narration></p>
   
   <p>
    <narration>The farmers give the hockey players a barrage of insults.</narration> <notes>(&larr;large mistake)</notes>

<p>
    <narration>The hockey players are stunned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;hockey players have small OK&harr;&#xFE0E;<outcome-contrast>no</outcome-contrast> humor)</notes>

<p>We can use the same method to think about why some surreal content makes us laugh, but similar non-surreal content doesn’t:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Sam watches Fired Fireman 3 on his laptop. Chief is trying to get the household ready for school, but he’s comically inept at it. As he runs to get the doorbell, he slips on a toy car left on the stairs. Sam loves the slapstick in these things.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>Sam watches Jennifer slip on a toy car left on the stairs. His heart wrenches in fear.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    </div>

<p>While these diverging outcomes happen everywhere in our lives, they’re often <sem-weak>especially</sem-weak> divergent in spectator entertainment—like how a character gets hit by a bus, causing the other <term>characters</term> to <term>shriek in horror</term> and the <em>audience</em> to <em>laugh</em>.</p>



    <div class="box">
    
<p><headline>Coherent and surreal.</headline> Spectator entertainment can be emotionally <term>coherent</term> while still being emotionally <em>surreal</em>.</p> 

<p>This is familiar with action movies. When Rage Man punches through concrete in the opening scene of <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title>, the audience knows its surreal because people can't punch through concrete.</p> 

<p>But if the movie is consistent, Rage Man's feats of strengths throughout the movie will be coherent to this premise—even when still surreal relative to our lives.</p> 

<p>This happens with emotions too. When Jennifer acts in a play, her character is presented as composed and self-posessed. This makes her coolness to Sam's character laying across the table emotionally <term>coherent</term> <callback>(she had a small mistake and large OK)</callback> while still being emotionally <em>surreal</em>—since if Sam suddenly laid across the table in real life, Jennifer would be confused or upset. <callback>(She'd have a large mistake and small OK.)</callback></p>

<p>In the same way punching through concrete can by <term>physically</term> coherent without being physically realistic, being <em>emotionally</em> coherent doesn't mean something is emotionally realistic. Mistakes and OKs can behave coherently in movies, even when the evaluatory premises are surreal.</p>
