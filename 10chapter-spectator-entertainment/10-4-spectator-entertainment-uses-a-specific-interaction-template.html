Spectator entertainment uses a specific interaction template
</h1>


<p>Sometimes we watch movie characters give each other insults. <term>We</term> laugh—but the <em>characters</em> are devastated:</p>


<div class="vignette">

    <p><narration>Owen watches more of the Canadian comedy show.</narration></p>
   
   <p><narration>The farmers, Wayne and Daryl, are throwing a baseball in front of a field. The hockey players, Reilly and Jonesy, drive up in a jeep blasting annoying music. Reilly and Jonesy get out with two smiling women, who leave. Reilly and Jonesy fist bump.</narration></p>

<p><term>Owen</term> feels humor watching the clip, but the <em>characters</em> in the show <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> feel nearly as much humor.</p> 

<p>
We can think about this by looking at two different <vocab>interaction templates</vocab>: interpersonal templates and spectator templates.</p>


    <img src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-4-spectator-entertainment-uses-a-specific-interaction-template/10-4-0-two-templates.png"

style="max-width: 23rem ; margin-left: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"
>

<p>In an <term>interpersonal</term> template, people are <em>mutually</em> reactive to each other. But in a <term>spectator</term> template, the characters <em>aren't</em> reactive to the spectator.</p>

    <img src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-4-spectator-entertainment-uses-a-specific-interaction-template/10-4-1-influence.png"

style="max-width: 33rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem; "
>

<p>The spectator template is what allows spectator entertainment to have things both ways: the <term>characters</term> can feel <em>mistake-predominant</em> emotions from insults, while the <term>spectators</term> can feel <em>humor</em> from those insults:</p>

style="max-width: 21rem ; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem;"
>

<p>What generates humor for <term>spectators</term> doesn't always work for <em>participants</em>. This is why we don't want to use spectator entertainment for cues about how to make someone laugh in conversation—since this can lead to errors.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Just because we laugh at insults in spectator entertainment doesn't mean we can make our friend laugh by insulting them.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">It's not that insults can't ever make our friends laugh —since they can. Instead, it's that we can't transfer things wholesale between spectator and interpersonal templates without modification.</p></div>

   
    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Admiration without aspiration.</headline> The clip of the farmers and hockey players was seen millions of times, with people admiring it for its caricature, delivery, pacing, scripting, and so on. One of the top comments saw the dialogue as loosely aspirational:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Commenter:</speaker> “How would a person get that good at comebacks and insults? I mean I know it’s all scripted but shit. That’s superhuman levels of wit.”</p>
</div> 

<p>The commenter answered their own question! We <sem>can’t</sem> get that good at comebacks and insults. The writers of the show aren’t that good at spontaneous comebacks and insults. They had a long production cycle and lots of crew to create an illusion of superhuman spontaneity.</p>

<p>Sometimes we think we’re supposed to be able to be like people in comedies because we like comedies. But we’re not—for the same reason we don’t think we’re supposed to be like action heroes just because we like action movies.</p>
