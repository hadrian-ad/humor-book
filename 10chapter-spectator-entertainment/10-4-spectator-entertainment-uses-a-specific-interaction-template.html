<p><headline>Emotional templates.</headline> This chapter is focused on spectator entertainment. This is when the goal is the emotional experience of the audience.</p>

<p>Something like an Ultimate practice is not spectator entertainment, because the goal isn't what spectators feel watching practice </p>
 
<p>Instead, Ultimate practice has an observed emotion network&mdash;we can describe it from Emma and Zoe's perspective with a spectator template&mdash;but it's not spectator entertainment.</p> 

    <p>We now have two things: spectator <term>entertainment</term>, and spectater <em>templates</em>. What's the difference?</p>
 
<p>The difference is <sem>goals</sem>. If we watch a play, the goal of everyone there is to prioritize our experience as the audience.  <callback>(Spectator template that's also spectator entertainment.)</callback></p> 
    
<p>But if we watch people from our window, the goal of everyone there is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> to prioritize our experience as the audience. <callback>(Spectator template that's <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> also spectator entertainment.)</callback></p>  

<p>Spectator templates are common things that happen all the time. Students in classrooms; friends listening to friends bicker; patrons vaguely aware of the table over; and so on&mdash;all normal parts of daily life, where we float between different levels of mutual reactivity.</p>
   
<p>By contrast, spectator entertainment uses this template, but <sem>also</sem> alters the goals and priorities to varying degrees. This makes it a rarer version of a spectator template:</p>

<!--
<p>Similarly, it's not spectator entertainment when we watch our friends argue or overhear a discussion the table over. We're in a spectator <term>template</term>, because we're removed from the mutual interaction—but since our emotions aren't the priority of what we're observing, it's not spectator <em>entertainment</em>.

<p>Sometimes we watch movie characters give each other insults. <term>We</term> laugh—but the <em>characters</em> are devastated:</p>

<p><term>Owen</term> feels humor watching the clip, but the <em>characters</em> in the show <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> feel nearly as much humor.</p> 

<p>
We can think about this by looking at two different <vocab>interaction templates</vocab>. In an <term>interpersonal template</term>, people are <term>mutually</term> reactive to each other. But in a <em>spectator template</em>, the characters <em>aren't</em> reactive to the spectator.</p>

alt="This image expands on the previous one, by clarifying an interpersonal template has two-way influence, while a spectator template has one-way influence."
style="max-width: 33rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem; "

<p>The spectator template is what allows spectator entertainment to have things both ways: the <term>characters</term> can feel <term>mistake-predominant</term> emotions from insults, while the <em>spectators</em> can feel <em>humor</em> from those insults:</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Just because <term>we</term> laugh at insults in spectator entertainment doesn't mean we can make our <em>friends</em> laugh by insulting them.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">It's not that insults don't ever make our friends laugh—since they do! Instead, it's that we can't transfer things wholesale between spectator and interpersonal templates without modification.</p></div>

<p><headline>Admiration without aspiration.</headline> The clip of the farmers and hockey players was seen millions of times, with people admiring it for its caricature, delivery, pacing, scripting, and so on. One of the top comments saw the dialogue as loosely aspirational:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Commenter:</speaker> “How would a person get that good at comebacks and insults? I mean I know it’s all scripted but shit. That’s superhuman levels of wit.”</p>
</div> 

<p>The commenter answered their own question! We <sem>can’t</sem> get that good at comebacks and insults. The <sem-weak>writers</sem-weak> of the show aren’t that good at spontaneous comebacks and insults. They had a long production cycle and lots of crew to create an illusion of superhuman spontaneity.</p>

<p>Sometimes we think we’re supposed to be able to be like people in comedies because we like comedies. But we’re <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> supposed to be—for the same reason we don’t think we’re supposed to be like action heroes just because we like action movies.</p>
