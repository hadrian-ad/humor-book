Emotional intuition
</h1>


<p>Spectator entertainment is often commercialized humor: there’s a commercial motivation somewhere in the creative chain. When things are commercialized, they have design priorities that shape how they turn out.</p> 

<p>This is obvious in a hotel, where the hotel rooms have design priorities like that they:</p> 

<ul>
   <li>be easy to clean</li>
    <li>be durable</li>
    <li>be inoffensive</li>
    <li>have an orderly and efficient arrangement</li>
    <li>not be more expensively furnished then necessary</li>
    <li>reduce theft</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This is part of why hotel rooms look like hotel rooms, and not like someone’s bedroom. Someone can have whatever art they like on the walls of their bedroom, since they’re not worried someone will steal it or give them a bad review, like in a hotel.</p> 

<p>Something similar happens to commercialized humor. The commercialization gives design priorities to things like movies or comedians. They may have to:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>appeal to a broad audience</li>
    <li>be a conventional length</li>
    <li>be accessible to many people</li>
    <li>be reproducible</li>
    <li>fit an advertising model</li>
    <li>not allow disruptive interaction from the audience</li>
    <li>represent the distributor or host</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This is one of the reasons a funny movie and our funny partner aren’t similar. Our partner will activate different topics, use different methods, and generate different emotional states than a movie will. In part, that’s because our partner isn’t shaped by any commercial priorities!</p> 

<p>Our partner is focused on us and reacting to us, interpersonally. They can do this without worrying about whether they appeal to a broad audience or if they fit an advertising model. Our partner can generate humor in us in ways that aren’t comparable to spectator entertainment, for the same reasons our residential bedroom can look different than a hotel bedroom.</p> 

<p>We’re often aware of the benefits and downsides of for-profit things, like hotels. We usually see these benefits and downsides as happening in a scale proportional to their commercialization—a resort with 1,000 rooms has a different scaling factor than a bed and breakfast with three rooms.</p>

<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>

<p class="for-instance">The resort may have efficiencies of scale, so their 1,000 rooms can support a water park and huge commercial kitchens—while a three-room bed and breakfast can’t. At the same time, the resort will be unable to have an entrance that's cozy, delicate, detailed, distinctive, small, textured, unique, and so on—there's just too many people coming in and out!</p> 

<p>But even though we think this way for things like hotels, we sometimes don’t notice that spectator entertainment is often similarly for-profit—and also has upsides and downsides as the commercialization scales up and down. A comedic movie for ten million people is very different then a small open mic night to ten listeners.</p> 

<p>This can help us think about why people want to go to small humor-generating environments, like a local comedy club, improv show, open mic night, regional film festival, underground theater, and so on—even if those things seem unappealing to us.</p> 

<p>People enjoy going to them for the same reason people like going to art films, indie bands, indie games, niche artists, small content creators, and so on—the less commercialized things are, the less they’re shaped by commercial design constraints. This is similar to the reason we like being around individuals, and not just characters in movies.</p>

<p>The people who attend these things often experience them as authentic, cutting-edge, fresh, raw, relevant, resonant, vivid, or so on—it’s the same for a local artist or band as for a small-time humorist.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If a movie is trying to reach tens of millions of people, it has design priorities that will screen out niche content—we won’t see a blockbuster movie that makes a joke about a restaurant in our hometown.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">However, a local humorist may make jokes about that specific restaurant—providing something we won’t get from something more highly commercialized. This is part of the appeal of user-generated content on forums as well, like memes, which allow for low-cost sharing of small-scale spectator entertainment.</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, the chance to <sem>be</sem> somewhere gives us a richer range of active topics. Watching a stand-up comic on our computer isn’t the same experience as <sem>being</sem> at the comedy club—we have a different set of active topics and evaluations when there than when just at home. And beyond the experience itself, the act of going to and leaving a place gives us different bookending experiences.</p> 

<p>All this can help us contextualize things we encounter that intend to generate humor—and we can avoid getting stuck in the idea that highly-commercialized instances of spectator entertainment somehow "are" all of humor.</p>
