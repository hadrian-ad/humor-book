We don't always register surreal things
</h1>

<p>Surreal elements in spectator entertainment can become so familiar that we don’t even register that they’re surreal—they seem real.</p>

<p>This is like how editing is surreal:</p>

<h2>Editing in comedies is surreal</h2>
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin are watching Fired Fireman 2</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>The lieutenant and Chief are arguing about the secret identity of the Arsonist King as they walk down a hallway in the police station. The scene cuts to them in the lieutenant's car, but their dialogue continues unbroken from where it was in the hallway.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <speech>“I love how the movie just cuts as if they paused their conversation for ten minutes while they got into the car!</speech> <notes>(&larr;the scene treats time and space surreally by continuing same conversation in different places)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“I never noticed that before!" </speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor has lost track of the surreal elements of spectator entertainment)</notes></p> </div>

<p>No one has ever had a conversation like Chief and the lieutenant, where causality, space, and time warp to allow a conversation to continue unbroken. It’s surreal!</p> 

<p>There’s nothing wrong with this surrealness—the movie’s goal is to generate humor, not be realistic for realism’s sake. At the same time, it would be wrong to lose track of the fact that these comedies <em>are</em> surreal. That would give us a distorted understanding of how the world is actually working around us.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">If police took grappling cues from professional wrestling matches, they’d be taking spectator entertainment as a template for how to interpersonally interact with others—a disturbing error.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Similarly, if we watched a musical and thought cool people were <em>supposed</em> to be able to make a train car full of strangers spontaneously dance, we’d be comparing ourselves to an unachievable, surreal standard.</p>
        
    <p class="for-instance-text">In the same way, if we watch a comedy with amazing extended repartee and think it’s a template for how we can or should interact with others, we would also end up in disharmony with how humor and the world works around us.</p>
    </div>




<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Seeing surreal</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>There are a few ways to see comedies as surreal. We can imagine:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>sitcoms with the laugh track removed—and notice how the cadence of conversation is surreal without it.</li>
    <li>transcripts of a hilarious night with family or friends—and notice how the transcription doesn’t at all mimic the script of a comedic scene</li>
    <li>screenplays that took months to write and tune—and notice that movie characters pretend to do all that extemporaneously during conversation</li>
    <li>comedies where the camera only follows a single person without cuts—and notice how that changes the flow of the film</li>
    <li>scenes where a character doesn’t notice someone is obviously hiding something behind their back—and notice that this isn’t how people would usually behave</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>With practice, we can re-see spectator entertainment as surreal. This helps us avoid ineffectively using spectator entertainment as a template for humor in interpersonal conversations.</p>
