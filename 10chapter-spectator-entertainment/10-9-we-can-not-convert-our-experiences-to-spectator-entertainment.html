We can't convert our experiences to spectator entertainment
</h1>

<p>Achievement, comfort, generosity, safety, welcome and so on have generated humor all our lives. But these moments of humor don't translate straightforwardly to spectator humor.</p>

<p>For instance, while Zoe feels humor below, we probably didn’t feel as much humor as she did:
    </p>
 

<p>Zoe come in from the rain, and has to push against the door to close it against the wind. Inside, her apartment is calm and quiet, with the rain against the windows. “Phew!” Zoe says, laughing. (&larr;Zoe feels comfort, relief, safety, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

<p>Reader: *keeps reading* (&larr;reader doesn't feel comfort, relief, safety, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>




<p>The evaluatory conditions are too different! This is why simply reading about Zoe feeling comfort doesn't also give us the same feeling of comfort.</p> 

<p>If we want, we can turn some of our previous examples into flat jokes—into spectator humor: </p>

<p>Zoe’s experience</p>

<p>Zoe comes in from the rain, and has to push against the door to close it against the wind. Inside, her apartment is calm and quiet, with the rain against the windows. “Phew!” Zoe says, laughing. (&larr;Zoe feels comfort, relief, safety, and so on)</p>

<p>Spectator humor</p>

<p>Did you hear the one about the Environmental Studies major who went running in the rain? It got really bad at the end, but then she made it! Haha. (&larr;if we feel humor from a flat joke, it’s for reasons other than comfort, relief, safety, and so on) </p>

<p>Owen’s experience</p>

<p>Owen: *after walking around for an hour* *finds Emma* “Emma, I’m sorry I was such an asshole. Like, really sorry. I got defensive. You were right, as usual, even when it’s hard for me. I didn’t mean what I said.”</p>

<p>Emma: *keeps typing* “Yeah, well. Thanks. I appreciate that. And, you know, on my end, sometimes people have told me… I lack tact.”</p>

<p>Owen: *sits down* *laughs* (&larr;Owen feels closeness, connection, belonging, reconciliation, relief, safety, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;humor) “Emma, I think you’re just great the way you are.”</p>

<p>Emma: *laughs* (&larr;Emma feels closeness, connection, belonging, reconciliation, relief, safety, and so on) (leased) “Okay. Let’s not overdo it there.”</p>

<p>Spectator humor</p>

<p>Did you hear about the time one friend caught another friend doing something wrong, and called him out for it? The friend thought about it and apologized! Haha! And then she apologized too! (&larr;if we feel humor from a flat joke, it’s for reasons other than belonging, connection, reconciliation, and so on)</p>

<p>Trevor’s experience</p>

<p>Trevor is talking the dog out at night. As General Zod squats to pee, Trevor looks into the nearby patch of dark trees, and a deep fear comes over him. He starts to jog back to the house with the dog until he feels possessed by terror and sprints the final way.</p>

 <p>He races inside and locks the door, and breathes a sigh of relief. “Phew. We made it, Zod. Safe!” He laughs as the dog wags its tail. (&larr;Trevor feels release, relief, safety, and so on)</p>

<p>Spectator humor</p>

<p>Did you hear the one about the nontraditional Mechanical Engineering student who took his dog out to poop, and then got really scared at nothing? Yeah, he ran back inside and locked the door! (&larr;if we feel humor from a flat joke, it’s for reasons other than feels release, relief, safety, and so on)</p>

<p>Lina’s experience</p>

<p>Lina gets an email that her college decision notification is ready. Her blood freezes. Heart pounding, she logs on to her account and clicks the ‘view decision update’ letter. Her mouth is dry while it loads. “Congratulations!” the letter says. Lina leaps up and pumps her fist. “Mom, mom!” she yells, thumping down the stairs. “I got into Pitt!” She jumps up and down and dances, glowing with happiness. (&larr;Lina feels achievement, accomplishment, relief, success, and so on)</p>

<p>Spectator humor</p>
<p>Did you hear about the time a high schooler got into college? Haha, man! (&larr;if we feel humor a flat joke, it’s for reasons other than achievement, accomplishment, success, and so on)</p> 

<p>People in the actual examples felt achievement, safety, or so on—but we can't repackage this achievement into a joke. If we feel humor from the jokes, it's for different reasons than they why they felt humor.</p>

<p>If we only think about humor by using examples focused on making us, as readers, feel humor, it would be hard to notice that people feel humor from achievement, belonging, safety, and so on.</p>

 




<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Flat jokes</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

  <p>Some of us feel humor at the flat jokes above. Why would flat jokes sometimes generate humor? For the same reason any joke generates humor. Our expectations have been set by the style of examples throughout this book. A change in this style then deviates from our expectations—the change in style is a mistake.</p>
  
<p>If we evaluate these mistakes as equal to our OK, we feel humor—if we don't, we won't. Since we’re trying to learn something through a comparison, we might describe our humor as insight or realization.</p>

<p>Our topics (‘change of style’) are different than Zoe’s topics (‘bad weather’), just like our humor family words (insight) are different than hers (safety). Even though the two examples are superficially about the same thing, the humor we feel and the humor the characters feel are different.
