We can't convert our experiences to spectator entertainment
</h1>

<p><emotions>Achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions> and so on have generated humor all our lives. But these moments of humor don't translate straightforwardly to spectator humor.</p>

<p>For instance, while <term>Zoe</term> feels humor below, <em>we</em> probably didn’t feel as much humor as she did:
    </p>
 

<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Zoe come in from the rain, and has to push against the door to close it against the wind. Inside, her apartment is calm and quiet, with the rain against the windows.</narration> <speech>“Phew!”</speech> <narration>Zoe says, laughing.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Reader:</speaker> <action>*reads about Zoe coming home*</action> <action>*keeps reading*</action> <notes>(&larr;reader doesn't feel much <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;little humor)</notes></p>

<p>Why didn't the reader feel as much humor as Zoe? The evaluatory conditions are too different! Simply <em>reading</em> about someone feeling <emotions>comfort</emotions> doesn't transfer the same feeling of <emotions>comfort</emotions>.</p> 

<p>If we want, we can turn some of our previous examples into flat jokes—into spectator humor: </p>

<h2>Converting an interpersonal experience into spectator entertainment:</h2>

<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Did you hear the one about the Environmental Studies major who went running in the rain? It got really bad at the end, but then she made it! Haha.</narration> <notes>(&larr;if we feel humor from a flat joke, it’s for reasons other than the <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on)</notes> </p>
    </div>

<div class="vignette">    
        <p><narration>Did you hear about the time one friend caught another friend doing something wrong, and called him out for it? The friend thought about it and apologized! Haha! And then she apologized too! </narration><notes>(&larr;if we feel humor from a flat joke, it’s for reasons other than <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on)</notes></p>
        </div>
<div class="vignette">        
            <p><narration>Did you hear the one about the nontraditional Electrical Engineering student who took his dog out to poop, and then got really scared at nothing? Yeah, he ran back inside and locked the door!</narration> <notes>(&larr;if we feel humor from a flat joke, it’s for reasons other than feels <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on)</notes></p>
            
            </div>
            
            <div class="vignette"><p><narration>Did you hear about the time a high schooler got into college? Haha, man!</narration> <notes>(&larr;if we feel humor a flat joke, it’s for reasons other than <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on)</notes></p> 
                
</div>
                
<p>In our actual examples, people felt <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on—but we can't repackage their <emotions>achievement</emotions> through a joke. Their feelings of <emotions>achievement</emotions> are locked to their experience.</p> 

 <p>We might laugh from the flat jokes, but this humor comes for different reasons than why the characters themselves felt humor.</p>

<p>This is why we can't only focus on spectator entertainment when learning about humor. If we only used examples that made <em>us</em> laugh, it would obscure the fact that people feel humor from <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Flat jokes</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

  <p>Why would flat jokes sometimes generate humor? For the same reason any joke generates humor. Our <term>expectations</term> have been set by the style of examples throughout this book. A change in this style then <term>deviates from our expectations</term>—the change in style is a <term>mistake</term>.</p>
  
<p>If we evaluate these mistakes as equal to our <term>OK</term>, we feel humor—if we don't, we won't. Since we’re trying to learn something through a comparison, we might describe our humor as <emotions>insight</emotions> or <emotions>realization</emotions>.</p>

<p>Our topics <callback>(‘style of example’)</callback> are different than Zoe’s topics <callback>(‘bad weather’)</callback>, just like our clearest humor family words (<emotions>insight</emotions>) are different than hers (<emotions>safety</emotions>). So even though the two examples superficially have the same content, the humor we may feel and the humor the characters feel are different.
