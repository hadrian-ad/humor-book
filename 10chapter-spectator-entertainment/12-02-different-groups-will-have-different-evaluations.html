Evaluations are different for different groups

<p>We can use mistakes and OKs to think about why the <term>characters</term> and <em>spectators</em> have different emotional outcomes:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam walks into the kitchen and puts hand on Jennifer’s shoulder. He sees her bagel without cream cheese.</narration></p>  
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <internalaction>(surprised)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh, it’s the thing.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;medium mistake)</notes></p>

<p>We can use the same method to think about why some surreal content makes us laugh, but similar non-surreal content doesn’t:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Sam watches <book-title>Fired Fireman 3</book-title> on his laptop. Chief is trying to get the household ready for school, but he’s comically inept at it. As he runs to get the doorbell, he slips on a toy car left on the stairs. Sam loves the slapstick in these things.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>Sam watches Jennifer slip on a toy car left on the stairs. His heart wrenches in fear.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam does <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> feel <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    </div>

title="Flowchart III"

<p>While these diverging outcomes happen everywhere in our lives, in spectator entertainment the the <sem>priority</sem> is on the spectator. This priority shapes how spectator entertainment is put together.</p>



    <div class="box">
    
<p><headline>Coherent and surreal.</headline>  When the audience watches Rage Man punch through concrete in the opening scene of <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title>, they know this is surreal&mdash;people can't punch through concrete.</p> 

<p>Even though it's <term>surreal</term>, Rage Man's strength can still be <em>coherent</em> if the movie is consistent to its surreal premise.</p>

<p>In the same way things can be <term>physically</term> surreal while still physically coherent, things can be <em>emotionally</em> surreal while still emotionally coherent.</p>

<p>If James Bond is always calm or focused, the emotional premise is that he always has a large OK. We know this is surreal&mdash;people aren't calm when gambling, fighting, debating, and so on.</p>

 <p>At the same time, if the movie is consistent to these surreal evaluatory premises <callback>(James Bond is so capable that his OKs are large, and so experienced that his mistakes are small)</callback>, it will be emotionally <term>surreal</term> while still be emotionally <em>coherent</em>.</p>

<p>We don't take physical <term>consistency</term> to be the same thing as physical <em>realism</em>. If Rage Man consistently punches through concrete, it's not realistic&mdash;it just means its consistent.</p>

<p>For the same reason, we shouldn't take <outcome-contrast>emotional</outcome-contrast> <term>consistency</term> to be the same thing as physical <em>realism</em>. If James Bond is consistently unflappable, that doesn't mean it's realistic&mdash;it just means its consistent.</p>

<p>Audiences tend to dislike inconsistency more than surrealism in spectator entertainment. At the same time, we should be careful of the sleight-of-hand switch that something consistent is something realistic.</p>
