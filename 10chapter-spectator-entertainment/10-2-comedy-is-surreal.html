Comedy is surreal
</h1>


Spectator entertainment is surreal, like how action scenes are surreal:

Owen and Emma are watching the trailer for Blood Soul Revenge.

The hero, Rage Man, guns down dozens of henchmen while they ineffectively return fire. Then a missile explodes near him, throwing Rage Man against a concrete wall—but he gets up in time to behead a charging henchmen with a keyboard. (&larr;action is surreal)

Emma: “You know, I hear your body just liquidates if you’re close enough to be blasted off your feet by an explosion.” (&larr;action is surreal)

Owen: *laughs* “Yeah, but the dude’s not even wearing earplugs, so he’s clearly made of sterner stuff!” (&larr;action is surreal)

Emma: (thoughtfully) “Do you think you could really decapitate someone with a keyboard?” *laughs* (&larr;action is surreal)          

Emma and Owen don't go around thinking that they could elegantly decapitate henchmen with keyboards—they know it's surreal.

> Consider:

It doesn't matter to them that it's surreal, because they want Blood Soul Revenge to entertain them—not teach them how to fight, or to be realistic for realism’s sake.

But while it’s often obvious that action scenes are surreal, we don’t always think of comedy scenes as being equally surreal—but they are!



Sam and Jennifer are performing a play. Sam jumps on the table and smoothly props his head up, just like he's practiced hundreds of times, and the audience laughs. Their first table was wobbly, and Sam's happy the prop team found a sturdier one. (&larr;Sam has the right props and practice to lay across the table in a play)

Justin and Heather laugh as they watch the play. The next morning while eating breakfast, Justin decides to get on the table to make Jennifer laugh—but Heather's table shakes ominously as he awkward clambers on. He barely avoids knocking off a plate, and he doesn't fit on the table like he thinks. Heather is looking shocked, bewildered, and concerned. (&larr;scene from a comedy is surreal, which is why it can't be straightforwardly imitated in real life)



Owen is watching a clip online from a comedy show about a small town in Canada:

Daryl, Dan, Katy, and Wayne are picking up rocks in a field of tall grass.

Wayne: *popping up out of the grass with armful of rocks* (confessing) “There's been an incident, and I'd like to talk about it.”

Daryl: “Get after it.”

Wayne: *hesitates*

Dan: *encouraging* “Well pitter patter, let's get at 'er.”

Katy: (exasperated) "Spit it out big shoots.”

Wayne: (reluctantly) “I seen Stewart's horn.”

Katy: *taken aback* “What?”

Daryl: “You've seen his impaler?”

Dan “His bobbydangler?”

Wayne: “Well...”

Daryl: “You've seen his PhD?”

Dan: “His WMD?”

Wayne: “Well look fellers...”

Daryl: “You've seen his friendly weapon?”

Dan: “His sticky grenade?”

Katy: “His ground squirrel?”

Wayne: (confirming) “Yeah, I've seen his ground squirrel”

Daryl: “You've seen Stuart's mill stone?”

Dan: “You've seen his custard slinger?”

Wayne: “Well I'm coming up the stairs, he's coming out the bathroom, naked as a jaybird for some fucking reason… I round the corner and, yeah, I seen his, ah...”

Daryl: “His hollow point?”

Dan: “His hard drive?”

Wayne: (correcting) “Well his floppy disk is what I've seen, yeah.”

Daryl: “Well. What's the evaluation?”

Katy: “Yeah.”

Dan: (curiously) “I'd hear an assessment.”

Wayne: *far away look* “You want to know what. It looked like a tall boy can of red bull hanging there.”

Katy: “No.”

Wayne: “Like a tube of tennis balls hanging there, four pack”

Katy: “Shut up”

Wayne: “Looked like a fucking policeman's flashlight from the 1980s hanging there.”

Katy: “You're joking.”

Wayne: *turns to look at Katy* “That is no joke.”

Daryl: (admiringly) “Good job Stewart.”

Wayne: (politely) “That's what I said, I said ‘good for him’.”

Dan: (with mixed feelings, but polite) “Good for you, Stewart.”

Owen has a broad smile as he watching the exchange, and laughs at the flashlight joke.




Like the action scene, this comedic scene is emotionally, practically, and situationally surreal.

The scene is emotionally surreal because no one reacts normally. It would be surreal for Emma, Zoe, and Owen to somehow have an impromptu conversation like this in a field and not show any amazement, amusement, reflection, self-reference, or so on.
The scene is practically surreal. Emma, Zoe, and Owen can’t have this kind of prolonged, rhythmic, and spontaneous wit, any more than they can have prolonged, rhythmic, and spontaneous sword fights. It’s just not something people can suddenly do. 
The scene is situationally surreal. They’re collecting rocks from tall grass without gloves, work clothes, wheelbarrows, and so on. 
In the same way extended fist fights don’t actually happen in the world, extended witty repartee doesn’t happen either. These things are surreal!

> Consider:

In real life, there are witty conversations, and there are fist fights—but they’re not extended, rhythmic, unhesitating, and crystal clear to spectators like they can be in some spectator entertainment. 


We don’t always notice that extended, witty conversations in comedies are surreal—but once it’s pointed out, it’s obvious that stylized witty conversation isn't something that happens in real life
