Comedy is surreal
</h1>


<p>Spectator entertainment is <term>surreal</term>, like how action scenes are surreal:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen and Emma are watching the trailer for Blood Soul Revenge.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>The hero, Rage Man, guns down dozens of henchmen while they ineffectively return fire. Then a missile explodes near him, throwing Rage Man against a concrete wall—but he gets up in time to behead a charging henchmen with a keyboard.</narration> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“You know, I hear your body just liquidates if you’re close enough to be blasted off your feet by an explosion.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Yeah, but the dude’s not even wearing earplugs, so he’s clearly made of sterner stuff!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(thoughtfully)</internalaction> <speech>“Do you think you could really decapitate someone with a keyboard?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>          
    </div>

<p>Emma and Owen don't go around thinking that they could elegantly decapitate henchmen with keyboards—they know it's surreal.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">It doesn't matter to them that it's surreal, because they want <i>Blood Soul Revenge</i> to entertain them—not teach them how to fight, or to be realistic for realism’s sake.</p>
    </div>

<p>But while it’s often obvious that <em>action</em> scenes are surreal, we don’t always think of <em>comedy</em> scenes as being equally surreal—but they are!</p>


<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer are performing a play. Sam jumps on the table and smoothly props his head up, just like he's practiced hundreds of times, and the audience laughs. Their first table was wobbly, and Sam's happy the prop team found a sturdier one.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam has the right props and practice to lay across the table in a play)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Justin and Heather laugh as they watch the play. The next morning while eating breakfast, Justin decides to get on the table to make Jennifer laugh—but Heather's table shakes ominously as he awkward clambers on. He barely avoids knocking off a plate, and he doesn't fit on the table like he thinks. Heather is looking shocked, bewildered, and concerned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;scene from a comedy is surreal, which is why it can't be straightforwardly imitated in real life)</notes></p>
    
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen is watching a clip online from a comedy show about a small town in Canada.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Daryl, Dan, Katy, and Wayne are picking up rocks in a field of tall grass.</narration></p>
    
    <p>Wayne: *popping up out of the grass with armful of rocks* (confessing) <speech>“There's been an incident, and I'd like to talk about it.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Daryl:</speaker> <speech>“Get after it.”</speech></p>

    <p><speaker>Daryl:</speaker> <speech>“Well. What's the evaluation?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Katy:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech></p>

    <p><speaker>Wayne:</speaker> <speech>“Like a tube of tennis balls hanging there, four pack”</speech></p>

    <p><speaker>Wayne:</speaker> <speech>“Looked like a fucking policeman's flashlight from the 1980s hanging there.”</speech></p>

<p>Like the action scene, this comedic scene is <term>emotionally</term>, <term>practically</term>, and <term>situationally</term> surreal.</p>

<ul>
   <li>The scene is <em>emotionally</em> surreal because no one reacts normally. It would be surreal for Emma, Zoe, and Owen to somehow have an impromptu conversation like this in a field and not show any amazement, amusement, reflection, self-reference, or so on.</li>
   
    <li>The scene is <em>practically</em> surreal. Emma, Zoe, and Owen can’t have this kind of prolonged, rhythmic, and spontaneous wit, any more than they can have prolonged, rhythmic, and spontaneous sword fights. It’s just not something people can suddenly do.</li> 
    
    <li>The scene is <em>situationally</em> surreal. They’re collecting rocks from tall grass without gloves, work clothes, wheelbarrows, and so on.</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p>In the same way extended fist fights don’t actually happen in the world, extended witty repartee doesn’t happen either. These things are surreal!</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">In real life, there <em>are</em> witty conversations, and there <em>are</em> fist fights—but they’re not extended, rhythmic, unhesitating, and crystal clear to spectators like they can be in some spectator entertainment. </p>
    </div>
    
<p>We don’t always notice that extended, witty conversations in comedies are surreal—but once it’s pointed out, it’s obvious that stylized, witty conversations aren't things that happens in real life</p>
