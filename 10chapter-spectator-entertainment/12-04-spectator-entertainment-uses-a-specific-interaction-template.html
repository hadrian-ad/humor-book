Evaluatory Screens
</h1>

<p>To think about spectator entertainment, we can use emotion networks:</p>
    
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Rosie and her friends examine the creepy old house.</narration></p>
    </div>

<p>We can add <sem-weak>observers</sem-weak> of this emotion network:</p>
          
        <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin are watching Squeal II</narration>  <notes>(&larr;Trevor and Yasmin observe an emotion network)</notes></p>

<p>When Trevor and Yasmin watch <book-title>Squeal II</book-title>, <term>they</term> can recieve evaluatory information from the <term>characters</term>, but the <em>characters</em> can't from <em>them</em>.</p>

<p><narration>She wanders over to a dusty jewelry box.</narration></p>

<p>Above, while <term>Trevor</term> gets evaluatory information from <term>Rosie</term>, <em>Rosie</em> can't get evaluatory information from <em>him</em>.</p>
  
<p>A movie has an <vocab>impermeable</vocab> screen&mdash;evaluatory information is completely filtered out. But something like a play has a <vocab>permeable</vocab> screen:</p>

<p>Which is why shouting at actors in a <term>movie</term> has a different result than shouting at actors in a <em>play</em>.</p>
  
  
          
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    

<p class="considertext">Spectator entertainment with <term>permeable</term> screens <callback>(in-person performances)</callback> often gives us the feeling of <term>including</term> us, which makes them feel vivid and interesting. Things with permeable screens feel dynamic, and allow for  reactive participation.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">By contrast, spectator entertainment with <em>impermeable</em> screens <callback>(remotely viewed or a static medium)</callback> often has the feeling of <em>excluding</em> us, which makes them feel lifeless or grating outside of specific circumstances.</p> 
   
    </div>
   
<div class="box"><p><headline>Screens.</headline> We can see all kinds of evaluatory screens:</p>
      
    <ul class="close-list">
         <li>A play has a <sem>pretend</sem> screen, where the actors recieve evaluatory information but mostly carries on as if they aren't there</li>
          
          <li>A movie has as <sem>absolute</sem> screen, where the characters will never recieve evaluatory information</li>
          
          <li>A window is a <sem>barrier</sem> screen, where evaluatory information could be let out by opening it</li> 
          
          <li>An athletic game has a <sem>concentration</sem> screen, where participants need so much focus that they can't focus on the audience</li></ul>
      
      <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>An evaluatory screen doesn't mean something is spectator entertainment. Something is only spectator entertainment when the <sem>priority</sem> is on one group&mdash;which may or may not have a screen.</p> 
             
    <p>If a salesman flatters us, there's no screen but since the priority is us it's spectator entertainment. Similarly, if we watch streetlife from our window, there's an evaluatory screen but since the priority isn't us it's not spectator entertainment.</p>
              </div>

  
  

<!--   
<p class="considertext">We like things with impermeable screens when we have control over when, where, and how we watch them. Things we don't have control over feel destructive to emotional life, like advertisement videos at gas stations, recorded training videos, TVs on at restaurants, and so on.</p>

   <!--
   Appendix? Second read through         
   <p>The way that things engage with the evaluatory information of its audience plays a large role in how we sort them by entertainment genre or category.</p>
  
<p class="for-instance">For instance</p>
  
 <p class="for-instance-text">Something like a play or open mic will involve selective engagement with evaluatory information. Stage actors will pause for laughter, but not smile because of it.

<p><headline>Emotional templates.</headline> This chapter is focused on spectator entertainment. This is when the goal is the emotional experience of the audience.</p>

<p>Something like an Ultimate practice is not spectator entertainment, because the goal isn't what spectators feel watching practice </p>
 
<p>Instead, Ultimate practice has an observed emotion network&mdash;we can describe it from Emma and Zoe's perspective with a spectator template&mdash;but it's not spectator entertainment.</p> 

    <p>We now have two things: spectator <term>entertainment</term>, and spectater <em>templates</em>. What's the difference?</p>
 
<p>The difference is <sem>goals</sem>. If we watch a play, the goal of everyone there is to prioritize our experience as the audience.  <callback>(Spectator template that's also spectator entertainment.)</callback></p> 
    
<p>But if we watch people from our window, the goal of everyone there is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> to prioritize our experience as the audience. <callback>(Spectator template that's <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> also spectator entertainment.)</callback></p>  

<p>Spectator templates are common things that happen all the time. Students in classrooms; friends listening to friends bicker; patrons vaguely aware of the table over; and so on&mdash;all normal parts of daily life, where we float between different levels of mutual reactivity.</p>
   
<p>By contrast, spectator entertainment uses this template, but <sem>also</sem> alters the goals and priorities to varying degrees. This makes it a rarer version of a spectator template:</p>

<!--
<p>Similarly, it's not spectator entertainment when we watch our friends argue or overhear a discussion the table over. We're in a spectator <term>template</term>, because we're removed from the mutual interactionâ€”but since our emotions aren't the priority of what we're observing, it's not spectator <em>entertainment</em>.
