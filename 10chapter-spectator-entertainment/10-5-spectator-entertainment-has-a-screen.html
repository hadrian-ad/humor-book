Spectator entertainment has a screen
</h1>

<p>In spectator templates, there’s a <term>screen</term> between us and what we’re spectating:</p>

style="max-width: 18rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem;"
>

<p>This screen is like a one-way emotional mirror: <em>our</em> evaluations change because of them, but <em>their</em> evaluations don't change because of us.</p>

    <p>Sometimes this screen is <term>permeable</term>—like if we’re listening to two of our friends argue. Other times, this screen is <term>impermeable</term>—like if we’re reading a graphic novel about two friends arguing.</p>

<p>Try as we might, we'll never influence the characters in a graphic novel—the impermeable screen creates a one-way emotional system where <em>we</em> can be influenced, but we can't influence <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>By contrast, watching our friends argue isn’t a closed emotional system. Just by being present, there's mutual reactivity—and we could become more involved at any moment we choose. </p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Some spectator entertainment has impermeable screens, like static movies—where yelling at a screen does nothing. But when we watch a play, there's a permeable screen—yelling at the stage brings mutual connectivity into play.</p> 
    
<p class="considertext">We often find spectator entertainment with permeable screens more vivid and interesting—the permeable screen feels dynamic, and allows for subtle kinds of reactive participation.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">By contrast, spectator entertainment with impermeable screens often has the feeling of excluding us—like advertisements at gas stations, which relentlessly continue regardless of anything going on around them.</p>

<p>A spectator <term>template</term> doesn't mean something is spectator <em>entertainment</em>.</p>

<p>When we watch both spectator wresting and interpersonal wresting from the sidelines, they're both spectator <term>templates</term>. As a spectator, we're not part of the mutual part of the evaluation system of either.</p>

 <p>The diffence is that it's only the spectator wrestling that's <em>prioritizing</em> our emotions. The interpersonal wrestlers don't really care about our emotions—this lack of priority means it's not spectator <term>entertainment</term>.</p>

<p>This is why it's not spectator entertainment when we watch our friends argue or overhear a discussion the table over. We're part of an spectator <term>template</term>—but that doesn't mean it's spectator <em>entertainment</em>.
