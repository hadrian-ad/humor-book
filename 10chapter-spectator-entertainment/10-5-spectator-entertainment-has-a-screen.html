Spectator entertainment has a screen
</h1>

<p>In spectator templates, there’s a <vocab>screen</vocab> between us and what we’re spectating:</p> 

    <img src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen/10-5-0-screen.png"

style="max-width: 18rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem;"
>

<p>This screen is like a one-way emotional mirror: <term>our</term> evaluations change because of them, but <em>their</em> evaluations don't change because of us.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're at a third-story window, watching people walk on the street below, <term>we'll</term> be reacting to evaluations below—but <em>they</em> won't be reacting to us.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Something similar happens when we watch a show. <term>We'll</term> be reacting to the evaluations we see—but <em>they</em> won't be reacting to us.</p>
    
    
</div>

<p>Sometimes this screen is <vocab>permeable</vocab>—like if we’re looking at people down on the street, where at any moment we could yell a greeting or warning to them <callback>(permeable screen)</callback>.</p>
       
<p>Other times, this screen is <vocab>impermeable</vocab>—like if we're watching a show, where no matter how much we yell at the screen we'll never influence them.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Some spectator entertainment has impermeable screens, like static movies—where yelling at a screen does nothing. But when we watch a play, there's a permeable screen—since the actors react to the audience, and we could always stand up and yell and bring mutual connectivity more into play.</p> 
    
<p class="considertext">We often find spectator entertainment with permeable screens gives the feeling of <term>including</term> us, which makes them feel vivid and interesting. The permeable screen feels dynamic, and allows for subtle kinds of reactive participation.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">By contrast, spectator entertainment with impermeable screens often has the feeling of <em>excluding</em> us, which makes them feel lifeless and grating outside very specific circumstances.</p> 
   
<p class="considertext">This is like advertisements at gas stations, which relentlessly continue regardless of anything going on around them—or recorded lectures that are unable to adjust pace for the students.</p>
    </div>




    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Emotional templates.</headline> While all spectator entertainment uses a spectator template, but not all things that use spectator templates are spectator entertainment:<p></p>

<p>When we watch both spectator wresting and interpersonal wresting from the sidelines, we're not part of the mutual evaluation system&mdash;they're <term>both</term> spectator templates.</p>

<p>But only the spectator wrestling is <em>prioritizing</em> our emotions. The interpersonal wrestlers don't really care about our emotions. In this way, both can have slots for spectators in their emotional system, while only one is spectator <sem>entertainment</sem>.</p>

<p>This is why it's not spectator entertainment when we watch our friends argue, or when we overhear a discussion the table over. By being removed from the mutual interaction, we're a <term>spectator</term>—but since our emotions aren't the priority, it's not spectator <em>entertainment</em>.
