Spectator templates have a screen
</h1>

<p>In spectator templates, there’s a <vocab>screen</vocab> between us and what we’re spectating:</p> 

    <img src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen/10-5-0-screen.png"

title="Screen"
alt="This image of a spectator template expands on the previous ones by pointing out a screen between characters and the spectator. The screen filters out reactivity, leaving only one-way influence. The characters can influence us, but we can't influence the characters."
style="max-width: 18rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem;"
>

<p>This screen is like a one-way emotional mirror: <term>our</term> evaluations change because of <term>them</term>, but <em>their</em> evaluations <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> change because of <em>us</em>.</p>

<p>Sometimes this is a literal digital screen&mdash;we might be watching a movie, or reading the news on our phone. But it could also just be us watching people on the street from our window.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're watching people walk on the street below from our third-story window, <term>we'll</term> be reacting to <term>them</term>—but <em>they</em> won't be reacting to <em>us</em>.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">This is what happens when we watch a show. <term>We'll</term> be reacting to <term>them</term>—but <em>they</em> won't be reacting to <em>us</em>.</p>
</div>

<p>Sometimes this screen is <term>permeable</term>—like if we’re looking at people down on the street. At any moment we could yell to them! <callback>(Permeable screen.)</callback></p>

        <img class="img-indent"
        src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen/15-5-1-permeable.png"

title="Permeable screen"
alt="This image has an interaction template labled 'watching from our window.' The spectator is seperated from the mutual emotional system by a dotted line, which is labled 'permeable screen.' The spectator recieves information from the other system, and has a tiny arrow heading back."
style="max-width: 22rem; margin-left: "
>
       
                     
<p>Other times, this screen is <em>impermeable</em>—like if we're watching a show. No matter how much we yell at the screen, we'll never influence the characters! <callback>(Impermeable screen.)</callback></p>

        <img class="img-indent"
        src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen/15-5-2-impermeable.sketchpad.png"

title="Impermeable screens"
alt="This image has an interaction template labled 'watching a show.' The spectator is seperated from the mutual emotional system by a solid line, which is labled 'impermeable screen.' The spectator recieves information from the other system, and can't send information."

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Some spectator entertainment has impermeable screens, like static movies—where yelling at a screen does nothing.</p> 
    
    
    <p class="considertext">But when we watch a play, there's a permeable screen—since not only are the actors reacting to the audience, and we could always stand up and yell at them and bring about more mutual connectivity.</p> 
    
<p class="considertext">Spectator entertainment with <term>permeable</term> screens often gives us the feeling of <term>including</term> us, which makes them feel vivid and interesting. Things with permeable screens feel dynamic, and allow for  reactive participation.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">By contrast, spectator entertainment with <em>impermeable</em> screens often has the feeling of <em>excluding</em> us, which makes them feel lifeless and grating outside very intentional circumstances.</p> 
<!--   
<p class="considertext">We like things with impermeable screens when we have control over when, where, and how we watch them. Things we don't have control over feel destructive to emotional life, like advertisement videos at gas stations, recorded training videos, TVs on at restaurants, and so on.</p>

    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Emotional templates.</headline> We now have two things: spectator <term>entertainment</term>, and spectater <em>templates</em>. What's the difference?</p>
 
<p>The difference is <sem>goals</sem>. If we watch a play, the goal of everyone there is to prioritize our experience as the audience.  <callback>(Spectator template that's also spectator entertainment.)</callback></p> 
    
<p>But if we watch people from our window, the goal of everyone there is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> to prioritize our experience as the audience. <callback>(Spectator template that's <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> also spectator entertainment.)</callback></p>  

<p>Spectator templates are common things that happen all the time. Students in classrooms; friends listening to friends bicker; patrons vaguely aware of the table over; and so on&mdash;all normal parts of daily life, where we float between different levels of mutual reactivity.</p>
   
<p>By contrast, spectator entertainment uses this template, but <sem>also</sem> alters the goals and priorities to varying degrees. This makes it a rarer version of a spectator template:</p>

title="Spectator templates are larger than spectator entertainment"
alt="This image shows a large circle labeled 'spectator template' containing a smaller circle called spectator entertainment."
style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem; "
>



<!--
<p>Similarly, it's not spectator entertainment when we watch our friends argue or overhear a discussion the table over. We're in a spectator <term>template</term>, because we're removed from the mutual interaction—but since our emotions aren't the priority of what we're observing, it's not spectator <em>entertainment</em>.
