Spectator entertainment has a screen
</h1>

<p>In spectator templates, there’s a <vocab>screen</vocab> between us and what we’re spectating:</p> 

    <img src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen/10-5-0-screen.png"

style="max-width: 18rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem;"
>

<p>This screen is like a one-way emotional mirror: <term>our</term> evaluations change because of them, but <em>their</em> evaluations don't change because of us.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're at a third-story window, watching people walk on the street below, <term>we'll</term> be reacting to evaluations below—but <em>they</em> won't be reacting to us.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Something similar happens when we watch a show. <term>We'll</term> be reacting to the evaluations we see—but <em>they</em> won't be reacting to us.</p>
    
    
</div>

<p>Sometimes this screen is <vocab>permeable</vocab>—like if we’re looking at people down on the street, where at any moment we could yell a greeting or warning to them <callback>(permeable screen)</callback>.</p>
       
<p>Other times, this screen is <vocab>impermeable</vocab>—like if we're watching a show, where no matter how much we yell at the screen we'll never influence them.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Some spectator entertainment has impermeable screens, like static movies—where yelling at a screen does nothing. But when we watch a play, there's a permeable screen—since the actors react to the audience, and we could always stand up and yell and bring mutual connectivity more into play.</p> 
    
<p class="considertext">We often find spectator entertainment with permeable screens gives the feeling of <term>including</term> us, which makes them feel vivid and interesting. Things with permeable screens feel dynamic, and allow for limited amounts of reactive participation.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">By contrast, spectator entertainment with impermeable screens often has the feeling of <em>excluding</em> us, which makes them feel lifeless and grating outside very specific circumstances.</p> 
   
<p class="considertext">This is like advertisements at gas stations, which continue regardless of anything going on around them—or recorded lectures that are unable to adjust pace for the students. The lack of any permeable screen means there can be no tailoring to the emotional situation.</p>
    </div>




    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Emotional templates.</headline> While all spectator entertainment uses a spectator template, not all things that use spectator templates are spectator entertainment:<p></p>

<p>We can think about this with wrestling. If we're watching an interpersonal wrestling match, we're the spectators in a spectator template. But since our emotional state isn't the <sem>priority</sem> of the wrestlers, it's not <sem>spectator entertainment</sem>.</p>

<p>This is why it's not spectator entertainment when we watch our friends argue or overhear a discussion the table over. We're in a spectator <term>template</term>, because we're removed from the mutual interaction—but since our emotions aren't the priority of what we're observing, it's not spectator <em>entertainment</em>.
