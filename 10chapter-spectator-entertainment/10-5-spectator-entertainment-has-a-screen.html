Spectator entertainment has a screen
</h1>

<p>In spectator templates, there’s a <vocab>screen</vocab> between us and what we’re spectating:</p> 

    <img src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen/10-5-0-screen.png"

title="Screen"
alt="This image of a spectator template expands on the previous ones by pointing out a screen between characters and the spectator. The screen filters out reactivity, leaving only one-way influence. The characters can influence us, but we can't influence the characters."
style="max-width: 18rem; margin-left: ; margin-top: 1rem;"
>

<p>This screen is like a one-way emotional mirror: <term>our</term> evaluations change because of <term>them</term>, but <em>their</em> evaluations <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> change because of <em>us</em>.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we're watching people walk on the street below from our third-story window, <term>we'll</term> be reacting to evaluations below—but <em>they</em> won't be reacting to us.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Something similar happens when we watch a show. <term>We'll</term> be reacting to the evaluations we see—but <em>they</em> won't be reacting to us.</p>
    
    
</div>

<p>Sometimes this screen is <vocab>permeable</vocab>—like if we’re looking at people down on the street, where at any moment we could yell to them <callback>(permeable screen)</callback>.</p>
       
<p>Other times, this screen is <vocab>impermeable</vocab>—like if we're watching a show, where no matter how much we yell at the screen we'll never influence the characters <callback>(impermeable screen)</callback>.</p>

        <img src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen/10-5-1-argue.png"

title="Permeable compared to impermeable screens"
alt="This image compares two specattor templates, one with a permeable screen represented by dotted line, and another with a solid impermeable screen. In the first colmn, we watch two friends argue but we can always extend influence back if we want. In the second column, we read about characters in a graphic novel arguing. There's nothing we can do to get past this screen."
style="max-width: 40rem; margin-left: "

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Some spectator entertainment has impermeable screens, like static movies—where yelling at a screen does nothing. But when we watch a play, there's a permeable screen—since the actors react to the audience, and we could always stand up and yell at them and bring about more mutual connectivity.</p> 
    
<p class="considertext">Spectator entertainment with <term>permeable</term> screens often gives us the feeling of <term>including</term> us, which makes them feel vivid and interesting. Things with permeable screens feel dynamic, and allow for limited amounts of reactive participation.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">By contrast, spectator entertainment with <em>impermeable</em> screens often has the feeling of <em>excluding</em> us, which makes them feel lifeless and grating outside very specific circumstances.</p> 
   
<p class="considertext">These are like recorded training videos or advertisements at gas stations, which trundle on no matter what. The lack of any permeable screen means there can be no tailoring to the emotional situation.</p>

<p><headline>Emotional templates.</headline> While all spectator entertainment uses a spectator template, not all things that use a spectator template are spectator entertainment:<p></p>
   
    <img src="../images/10c-images-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen/10-5-2-spectator-boxes.png"

title="Spectator templates are larger than spectator entertainment"
alt="This image shows a large circle labeled 'spectator template' containing a smaller circle called spectator entertainment."

<p>We can think about this with wrestling. If we watch a high school wrestling match, we're the spectator&mdash;it's a spectator template.</p>

<p>But since <sem-weak>our</sem-weak> emotional state isn't the <sem>priority</sem> of the wrestlers, it's not spectator entertainment.</p>

<!--
<p>Similarly, it's not spectator entertainment when we watch our friends argue or overhear a discussion the table over. We're in a spectator <term>template</term>, because we're removed from the mutual interaction—but since our emotions aren't the priority of what we're observing, it's not spectator <em>entertainment</em>.
    </p>
