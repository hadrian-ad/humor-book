Spectator entertainment can obscure humor family words
</h1>

<p>Spectator entertainment shows us what can generate humor for spectators—but it doesn’t necessarily give us a clear picture of what generates humor in our day-to-day experiences or interactions.</p>

<p>This is why it can be hard to notice humor family words if we’re only focusing on spectator entertainment.</p>

<div class="conisder"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Humor family words are context-specific alternatives for the generic word “humor”—like acceptance, accomplishment, achievement, appreciation, belonging, comfort, connection, delight, forgiveness, generosity, insight, joy, realization, reconciliation, release, revelation, relief, safety, success, welcome, and so on.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>For instance, whenever Jennifer gets into a hot tub, she smiles—she feels comfort. But she doesn’t necessarily feel comfort while watching someone else get into a hot tub:</p>



<div class="vignette">
       <p>Jennifer and Sam are watching the classic comedy from their childhood, Party Recon 6. While undercover at a house party, one of the Navy SEALs slips into the hot tub. (&larr;Jennifer doesn’t feel comfort from hot tub&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>
        
        <p>Commander Spiker: *muttering to self* “BUD/S never trained us for this shit.”</p>
        
        <p>Stacey: *drunk* *slurring* “Whaddya say?”</p>
        
        <p>Karen: *pulling up shirt* “Whooooo!”</p> 
        
        <p>Spiker: *face palms*</p>
        
        <p>Jennifer and Sam laugh. (&larr;Jennifer and Sam feel humor for reasons other than comfort)</p> 
        </div>

<p>Similarly, whenever Emma is celebrated, greeted, and shown around she feels welcome. But she doesn’t necessarily feel welcome when watching a scene of someone else being welcomed:
    </p>


<div class="vignette">
   <p>Emma is watching the first Fired Fireman.</p>
    
    <p>Chief is being welcomed to his new station. It’s going well until firefighter Joanna glides down the fire pole in a tank top. Chief’s mouth drops. She tosses her blowing hair in slow motion as she sultrily hefts an oxygen tank over one shoulder, and a fire axe over the other. Rose petals fall in slow motion behind her as fire hydrants explode. Emma smiles.</p>
    
    <p>Chief shakes himself out of his daydream.</p>
    
    <p>Joanna: *smiling quizzically* “Chief? Chief?”</p>
    
    <p>Chief: *stammering* “M-m-mice to n-n-neet you!”</p>
    
<p>Joanna: *smiling* “It’s nice to meet you too! We’re so glad you’re here.” (&larr;Emma doesn’t feel welcome from greeting&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)
        </p>    
   <p> Chief tries to speak but he’s tongue-tied. His face contorts comically as he tries to get words out, and his mouth flaps uselessly.
        </p>    
    <p>Emma smiles. Chief is such a dork. And Joanna is so glorious. (&larr;Emma feels humor for reasons other than welcome)</p>
    </div>

<p>Emma feels humor from watching social slapstick, but she doesn’t feel humor from doing social slapstick—she’d be mortified by social errors:
    </p>


<p>Instead, Emma would humor from being shown around and feeling welcome. This is the opposite of her reaction when watching spectator entertainment!</p>


<p>If Emma or Jennifer lose track of this spectator/interpersonal split, they’ll have a distorted picture of what generates humor in their interpersonal interactions.</p> 

<p>Emma would make someone laugh by making them feel comfort or welcome—and how social slapstick fits into that is subordinate to whether people feel humor family words or not.</p> 


That's the end of this chapter! Well done.

Next, we'll look at spectator humor profiles.

More examples. For more examples, see this chapter's appendix.

Money. We're used to thinking of hotels as commercialized, and that this commercialization shapes how hotels are. But we don't always think of humor attempts as being commercialized in a way that also shapes those humor attempts. We can read about this in the interval.  

End of chapter summary: When something's priority is our emotional state—and we have limited emotional influence on that thing—we call it "spectator entertainment."

Spectator entertainment surreal. We often think of comedies as representing real life—but they're as surreal as an action film.

While the same process of mistakes and OKs are always at work for humor, the same process can lead to different outcomes depending on whether we're acting, spectating, or in a mutual interaction.

Surreal things often scramble our usually associations with humor family words. It's not until we pay attention to these emotional systems that we can better sort out what we're feeling, independent of the superficial content.
