Actors are an evaluatory group
</h1>


<p>We’ve graphed the characters and the audience, but have left one group out—the actors themselves:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Sam and Jennifer are on set, and curtains rise.</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *tries to tiptoe gingerly past Jennifer* *audience laughs*</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: *not turning around* “Hello dear.”</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *freezes* *audience laughs* (trying to sound normal) “Hello honey.”</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: (falsely sweet) “I don’t want honey. I want cream cheese. You didn’t forget to buy me the cream cheese with scallions in it for my bagel, did you… dear?”</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *mouth drops* *bites nails with nervousness* *audience laughs* (with fake offense) “Calling me a rapscallion, are you?” *audience laughs*</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: (with dangerous restraint) “It’s a bad rap for sure. You know my morning depends on those perfect green scallion flecks.” *licks lips*</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *desperately trying to distract her* *lays across the table and roguishly props head up with arm* *audience laughs* “Instead of scallions, how about a stallion instead?” *Sam’s eyebrows wriggle up and down enticingly* *audience laughs harder*</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: *rolls eyes and pushes him away* “Why, is the mailman coming early? Now where is my damn cream cheese? I’m hungry!” (&larr;character Sam and character Jennifer have a large mistake and a small OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer and Sam pause to let the audience react. (&larr;actor Sam and actor Jennifer have a small mistakes and a large OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</p>
    
    <p>Audience: *audience cheers* (&larr;audience feels large mistakes have large OKs&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</p>

<p>Above, we’ve added a third evaluation column—Sam and Jennifer, as the real people under their characters.</p> 

<p>Sam and Jennifer themselves don’t feel humor, since they’ve rehearsed their scene so much—everything is completely expected and things feel without consequence. </p>

<p>In order for the actors themselves to feel humor, either the mistake needs to grow or the OK needs to shrink. If their evaluations balance, they’ll feel humor and potentially break character:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
   <p>This is Jennifer’s first performance—ever. She feels sick to her stomach. (&larr;Jennifer has small OK) She and Sam are onstage. The curtain rises. Jennifer pauses. Sam looks at her meaningfully—she has the first line. She opens her mouth and pauses. (&larr;Jennifer has small mistake) She giggles. (&larr;small mistake and small OK match&harr;&#xFE0E;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jennifer breaks character)</p>
    
     </div>
<div class="vignette">
   <p> Jennifer’s been acting since third grade. She’s seen and dealt with it all. (&larr;Jennifer has a large OK) She and Sam are onstage. The curtain rises. Sam takes a step forward and stumbles over a prop. As he twists, his costume snags and gives a loud rip. (&larr;Jennifer has a large mistake) He stands there, half-shirtless. The audience is shocked, but Sam rolls with it and leans suavely on the table, giving Jennifer a composed look. Jennifer gives a loud laugh before she recovers and continues the scene. (&larr;large mistake and large OK match&harr;&#xFE0E;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jennifer breaks character) </p>
    </div>
    
<p>We don’t usually have to think about the evaluations of actors, since movies and shows usually only use takes where actors don't break character—part of the illusion of the character.</p> 

<p>But other times, the contrast between the actors and the characters is part of the fun:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Sam is watching a comedian give fake names, but the comedian loses his composure and starts laughing. He turns red as he holds paper over his mouth to disguise his laughter. (&larr;we often track both actors and character emotions during live skits)</p>
    
     </div>
     
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Sam is watching a movie where the main character goes sledding. As the romantic lead pushes her down the hill, her face lights up. (&larr;actor has a genuine smile that comes from the actor, not the character)</p>
     </div>

<p>We also see actors break characters in bloopers. Actors will forget a line, growing their mistake. They’ll then either feel humor (mistake is balanced with OK) or mistake-predominant emotions (mistake is larger than OK):</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Sam is watching bloopers for Blood Soul Revenge.</p>
    
    <p>Daisy Girl: *to usurper* (defiant) “You’ll never find Rage Man. He’s a bladed shadow. He’s crimson moonlight. He treads the mmhmm…”</p>
    
    <p>Daisy Girl: *forgets line* *laughs* (&larr;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;breaks character)</p>
    
    <p>Sam smiles. (&larr;humor)</p>
    
    <p>- OR -</p>
    
    <p>Daisy Girl: *forgets line* “Dammit!” (&larr;mistake is larger than OK&harr;&#xFE0E;mistake-predominant emotions&harr;&#xFE0E;breaks character)</p>
    
    <p>Sam smiles. (&larr;humor)</p>
