Actors are an evaluatory group

<p>We’ve graphed the characters and the audience, but have left one group out—the actors themselves!</p>

<p>Above, we’ve added a third evaluation column: Sam and Jennifer—as the real people under their characters.</p> 

<p>Sam and Jennifer themselves don’t feel humor, since they’ve rehearsed their scene so much—everything is completely expected and things feel without consequence. </p>

<p>In order for the actors themselves to feel humor, either the mistake needs to grow or the OK needs to shrink. If their evaluations balance, they’ll feel humor and potentially break character:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    
   <p>
       <narration>This is Jennifer’s first performance—ever. She feels sick to her stomach.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer has small OK)</notes>
   </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>She and Sam are onstage. The curtain rises. Jennifer pauses. Sam looks at her meaningfully—she has the first line. She opens her mouth and pauses.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer has small mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>She giggles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;small mistake and small OK match&harr;&#xFE0E;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jennifer breaks character)</notes>
    </p>
     </div>
<div class="vignette">
   <p>
       <narration>Jennifer’s been acting since third grade. She’s seen and dealt with it all.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer has a large OK)</notes>
   </p>
   
    <p>
        <narration>She and Sam are onstage. The curtain rises. Sam takes a step forward and stumbles over a prop. As he twists, his costume snags and gives a loud rip.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer has a large mistake)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>He stands there, half-shirtless. The audience is shocked, but Sam rolls with it and leans suavely on the table, giving Jennifer a composed look. Jennifer gives a loud laugh before she recovers and continues the scene.</narration> <notes>(&larr;large mistake and large OK match&harr;&#xFE0E;humor&harr;&#xFE0E;Jennifer breaks character)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
    
<p>Since movies and shows usually only use takes where actors don't break character, we don't usually have to think about their evaluations.</p> 

<p>But sometimes the contrast between the <term>actors</term> and the <em>characters</em> is part of the fun of the entertainment:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam is watching a movie where the main character goes sledding. As the romantic lead pushes her down the hill, her face lights up.</narration> <notes>(&larr;actor has a genuine smile that comes from the actor, not the character)</notes></p>
     </div>


  
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam is watching a comedian give fake names, but the comedian loses his composure and starts laughing. He turns red as he holds paper over his mouth to disguise his laughter.</narration> <notes>(&larr;we often track both actors and character emotions during live skits)</notes></p>

<p>An actor is playing a bombastic, prejudicial character. The <term>character's</term> evaluations toward the world are supposed to be mistake-predominant, and the <em>actor's</em> evaluations toward the puns are supposed to be OK-predominant.</p> 
  
  <p>But in this case, the actor feels humor toward the puns, and his evaluations break through his character's evaluations, and he feels humor.</p>
   
  
   
    </div>
     
<p>We also see actors break characters in bloopers. Actors will forget a line, growing their mistake. They’ll then either feel humor <callback>(mistake is balanced with OK)</callback> or mistake-predominant emotions <callback>(mistake is larger than OK)</callback>:</p>
