<p>In the example below, Sam and Jennifer feel more humor than we, the readers, feel:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Sam walks into the kitchen and puts a hand on Jennifer’s shoulder. He sees her bagel without cream cheese.</narration></p>  
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <internalaction>(surprised)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh, it’s the thing.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Well, I wouldn’t just... you know…”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer feels humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <action>*sits down*</action> <speech>“Of course not!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels humor)</notes></p>

<p>Sam and Jennifer felt humor <sem-weak>participating</sem-weak> in the interaction. But that doesn't mean anyone watching a recording of these scene would feel the same amount of humor. </p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Just because Sam and Jennifer laughed doesn't mean it would make spectators laugh if it was put on a sitcom.</p>
</div>

<p>By contrast, if Sam and Jennifer were cast in a play, it wouldn't really matter whether they felt humor themselves or not. Their goal as actors would prioritize generating humor in spectators:</p>

<p>In the example above, it’s <sem>only</sem> the audience that felt humor. Sam and Jennifer weren't trying to shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor for <term>themselves</term>. They were trying to shift mistakes and OKs into humor for the <em>spectators</em>.</p>



    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Imitation.</headline> Even though some of our favorite experiences of humor happen while watching spectator entertainment, that doesn’t mean what we're watching is a good template for generating humor in our day-to-day lives.</p>
  
<p>Sometimes we want to imitate whatever made us laugh the most, but this ignores some important distinctions. When we’re spectators, we’re spectators—when we’re participants, we’re participants. What generates the most humor in one role doesn’t always generate the most humor in the other.</p>
  
<p>If we laugh at something in a TV show, all we know is that it's good at making people watching TV shows laugh. It doesn't straightforwardly mean it would be good at making the people around us laugh.
