Spectator entertainment is focused on observers
</h1>

<p>When we feel humor interpersonally, we usually feel more humor than any spectators would:</p>

<h2>Interpersonal humor focuses on participants</h2>

<div class="vignette">
   <p>Sam walks into the kitchen and puts a hand on Jennifer’s shoulder. He sees her bagel without cream cheese.</p>  
    
    <p>Sam: (Surprised) “Oh, it’s the thing.”</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: *laughs* “Well, I wouldn’t just... you know…” (&larr;Jennifer feels humor)</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *laughs* *sits down* “Of course not!” (&larr;Sam feels humor)</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: *amused* “One of these days…” *gestures* (&larr;Jennifer feels low-intensity humor)</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *smiles* (ironically wistful) “One day…” (&larr;Sam feels low-intensity humor)</p>

<p>This is a meaningful moment of mutual humor for Sam and Jennifer. But if we filmed this and put it on a sitcom, spectators wouldn't feel as much humor watching the interaction as Sam and Jennifer did participating in the interaction.</p> 

<p>By contrast, if Sam and Jennifer were cast in a play, it wouldn't really matter whether they felt humor themselves or not—their goal would be to generate humor in the spectators:</p> 

<h2>Spectator humor focuses on audience:</h2>

<p>Sam and Jennifer are on set, and curtains rise.</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p>Sam: *tries to tiptoe gingerly past Jennifer* *audience laughs* (&larr;audience feels humor)</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: *not turning around* “Hello dear.”</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *freezes* *audience laughs* (&larr;audience feels humor) (trying to sound normal) “Hello honey.”</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: (falsely sweet) “I don’t want honey. I want cream cheese. You didn’t forget to buy me the cream cheese with scallions in it for my bagel, did you… dear?”</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *mouth drops* *bites nails with nervousness* *audience laughs* (With fake offense) “Calling me a rapscallion, are you?” *audience laughs* (&larr;audience feels humor)</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: (with dangerous restraint) “It’s a bad rap for sure. You know my morning depends on those perfect green scallion flecks.” *licks lips*</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *desperately trying to distract her* *lays across the table and roguishly props head up with arm* *audience laughs* “Instead of scallions, how about a stallion instead?” *Sam’s eyebrows wriggle up and down enticingly* *audience laughs harder* (&larr;audience feels humor)</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: *rolls eyes and pushes him away* “Why, is the mailman coming early? Now where is my damn cream cheese? I’m hungry!” *audience cheers* (&larr;audience feels humor)</p>

<p>In the example above, Sam and Jennifer don’t feel humor—it’s only the audience that felt humor. They weren't trying to shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor for themselves. They were trying to shift mistakes and OKs into humor for the spectators.</p>




<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Spectater entertainment isn't meant to be imitated.</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

<p>Even though some of our favorite experiences of humor happen while watching spectator entertainment, that doesn’t mean spectator entertainment is a good template for generating humor in our day-to-day lives. 
    If we wanted to make our partner laugh in the morning, we’d want to take inspiration from the examples where the participants laugh (“oh, it’s the thing…”), not the spectators (*lays across table*).</p> 

<p>Sometimes we want to imitate whatever made us laugh the most. But when we’re spectators, we’re spectators—when we’re participants, we’re participants. What generates the most humor in one role doesn’t always generate the most humor in the other.</p>
