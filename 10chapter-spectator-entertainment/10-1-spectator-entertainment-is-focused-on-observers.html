<p>In the example below, <term>Sam and Jennifer</term> <callback>(the people)</callback> feel more humor than <em>we</em> <callback>(the readers)</callback> feel:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Sam walks into the kitchen and puts a hand on Jennifer’s shoulder. He sees her bagel without cream cheese.</narration></p>  
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <internalaction>(surprised)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh, it’s the thing.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Well, I wouldn’t just... you know…”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <action>*sits down*</action> <speech>“Of course not!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes></p>

<p>Sam and Jennifer felt humor <term>participating</term> in the interaction. But that doesn't mean anyone <em>watching</em> a recording of their interaction would feel the same amount of humor.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">The scene might be charming if filmed and shown on a sitcom&mdash;but audiences wouldn't laugh like Sam and Jennifer do just by watching it.</p>
</div>

<p>By contrast, if <term>Sam and Jennifer</term> were cast in a play, we <callback>(the audience)</callback> would feel more humor than <em>they</em> <callback>(the actors)</callback> would feel.</p>

    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <internalaction>(falsely sweet)</internalaction> <speech>“I don’t want honey. I want cream cheese. You didn’t forget to buy me the cream cheese with scallions in it for my bagel, did you… dear?”</speech></p>

<p>In the example above, it’s <sem>only</sem> the audience that felt humor. Sam and Jennifer weren't trying to shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor for <term>themselves</term>&mdash;they were trying to shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor for the <em>spectators</em>.</p>

    
    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Imitation.</headline> When we’re <term>spectators</term>, we’re <term>spectators</term>—when we’re <em>participants</em>, we’re <em>participants</em>. What generates the most humor in one role doesn’t always generate the most humor in the other.</p>

     
<p>If we laugh at something in a TV show, all we know is that that that thing was good at making people watching TV shows laugh&mdash;it doesn't straightforwardly mean it would be good at making the people around us laugh.
