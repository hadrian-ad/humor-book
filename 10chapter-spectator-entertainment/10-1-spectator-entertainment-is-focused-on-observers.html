Spectator entertainment is focused on observers
</h1>

<p>When we feel humor interpersonally, we usually feel more humor than any spectators would watching us:</p>

<p>This is a meaningful moment of mutual humor for Sam and Jennifer. They felt humor <term>participating</term> in the interaction. But if the scene had been recorded and put on a sitcom,  spectators would feel less humor <em>watching</em> the interaction as Sam and Jennifer did participating in the interaction.</p> 

<p>By contrast, if Sam and Jennifer were cast in a play, it wouldn't really matter whether they felt humor themselves or not—their goal during a scene would be to generate humor in spectators:</p>

<p>In the example above, it’s <sem>only</sem> the audience that felt humor. Sam and Jennifer weren't trying to shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor for <term>themselves</term>. They were trying to shift mistakes and OKs into humor for the <em>spectators</em>.</p>



    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Imitation.</headline> Even though some of our favorite experiences of humor happen while watching spectator entertainment, that doesn’t mean spectator entertainment is a good template for generating humor in our day-to-day lives.</p>
   
    <p>If we wanted to make our partner laugh in the morning, we’d want to take inspiration from the examples where the <term>participants</term> laugh <callback>(“oh, it’s the thing…”)</callback>, not the <em>spectators</em> <callback>(*lays across table*)</callback>.</p> 

<p>Sometimes we want to imitate whatever made us laugh the most, but this ignores our role. When we’re spectators, we’re spectators—when we’re participants, we’re participants. What generates the most humor in one role doesn’t always generate the most humor in the other.</p>
