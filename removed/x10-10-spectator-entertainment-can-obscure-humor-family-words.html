Spectator entertainment can obscure humor family words
</h2>

<p>Spectator entertainment shows us what can generate humor for <term2>spectators</term2>—but it doesn’t necessarily give us a clear picture of what generates humor in our day-to-day experiences or interactions.</p>

<p>This is why it can be hard to notice humor family words if we’re only focusing on spectator entertainment.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Remember:</p>
    
    <p>Humor family words are context-specific alternatives for the generic word “humor”—like acceptance, accomplishment, achievement, appreciation, belonging, comfort, connection, delight, forgiveness, generosity, insight, joy, realization, reconciliation, release, revelation, relief, safety, success, welcome, and so on.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>For instance, whenever Jennifer gets into a hot tub, she <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>—she feels <emotions>comfort</emotions>. But she doesn’t necessarily feel <emotions>comfort</emotions> while watching someone <term2>else</term2> get into a hot tub:</p>



<div class="vignette">
       <p><narration>Jennifer and Sam are watching the classic comedy from their childhood, Party Recon 6. While undercover at a house party, one of the Navy SEALs slips into the hot tub.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer doesn’t feel comfort from hot tub&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Commander Spiker:</speaker> <action>*muttering to self*</action> <speech>“BUD/S never trained us for this shit.”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Stacey:</speaker> <action>*drunk*</action> <action>*slurring*</action> <speech>“Whaddya say?”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Karen:</speaker> <action>*pulling up shirt*</action> <speech>“Whooooo!”</speech></p> 
        
        <p><speaker>Spiker:</speaker> <action>*face palms*</action></p>
        
        <p><narration>Jennifer and Sam laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer and Sam feel humor for reasons other than comfort)</notes></p> 
        </div>

<p>Similarly, whenever Emma is celebrated, greeted, and shown around she feels <emotions>welcome</emotions>. But she doesn’t necessarily feel <emotions>welcome</emotions> when watching a scene of someone else being welcomed:
    </p>


<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Emma is watching the first Fired Fireman.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Chief is being welcomed to his new station. It’s going well until firefighter Joanna glides down the fire pole in a tank top. Chief’s mouth drops. She tosses her blowing hair in slow motion as she sultrily hefts an oxygen tank over one shoulder, and a fire axe over the other. Rose petals fall in slow motion behind her as fire hydrants explode. Emma smiles.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Chief shakes himself out of his daydream.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Joanna:</speaker> <action>*smiling quizzically*</action> <speech>“Chief? Chief?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Chief:</speaker> <action>*stammering*</action> <speech>“M-m-mice to n-n-neet you!”</speech></p>
    
<p><speaker>Joanna:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> “It’s nice to meet you too! We’re so glad you’re here.” <notes>(&larr;Emma doesn’t feel welcome from greeting&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes>
        </p>    
   <p> <narration>Chief tries to speak but he’s tongue-tied. His face contorts comically as he tries to get words out, and his mouth flaps uselessly.</narration>
        </p>    
    <p><narration>Emma smiles. Chief is such a dork. And Joanna is so glorious.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels humor for reasons other than welcome)</notes></p>
    </div>

<p>Emma feels humor from <term>watching</term> social slapstick, but she doesn’t feel humor from <term2>experiencing</term2> social slapstick herself—she’d be mortified by similar social errors:</p>

<p>Instead, Emma would feel humor from being shown around and feeling <emotions>welcome</emotions>. This is the opposite of her reaction when watching spectator entertainment!</p>


<p>If Emma or Jennifer only try to learn about humor by focusing on spectator entertainment,  they’ll have a distorted picture of what generates humor in their interpersonal interactions.</p> 

<p>But if they pay attention to where people in their lives feel humor, they'll see that they can make people laugh by making them feel <emotions>comfort</emotions> or <emotions>welcome</emotions>—something that isn't always obvious if we only focus on spectator entertainment.</p>

    <p>That's the end of this chapter! Next, we'll look at spectator humor profiles.</p>

<p>When something's sole priority is our emotional state, it's "spectator entertainment."</p>

<ul>
   <li>Spectator entertainment is surreal. We often think of comedies as representing real life—but they're as surreal as an action film.</li>
    
    <li>While humor is always produced by the same process of mistakes and OKs, that same process can lead to different outcomes depending on whether we're acting, spectating, or in mutual interactions.</li>
    
    <li>Surreal things often scramble our usual associations between content and humor family words. It's not until we pay closer attention that we see the universality of humor family words.
