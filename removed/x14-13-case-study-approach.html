    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Outcome-first</h1>


  <p>We can put everything together to look at some case studies using signage. We'll see how humor outcomes can be used as tools to interpret situations and methods of design.</p> 


<!--
  <p>To start, we notice that what makes signs <term>effective</term> is <term2>humor</term2>&mdash;and what makes signs <term>ineffective</term> is the <outcome-contrast>lack</outcome-contrast> of <term2>humor</term2>. At first, this can seem odd&mdash;we don't usually think about humor as making signs function.</p> 
  
 <p>However, this makes more sense when we think about our emotional zones:</p>

 <ul class="close-list">
      
         <li>We'll be confused, disproportionately cautious, upset, and so on by signs that make us feel <strong>mistake-predominant emotions</strong>—like how a sign that says "this public transit system may kill you!" would create unease at odds with its purpose.</li>
      
    <li>We'll reach humor outcomes if the signs make us feel <strong>humor</strong>. If the humor is on relevant topics, we'll feel the sign has <humor-outcome>controlled a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>leveled criticism acceptably</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>shared perspectives</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
    
      <li>We'll ignore signs that make us feel <strong>OK-predominant emotions</strong>—like a generic caution sign we've seen thousands of times.</li> 
    
        </ul> 
  
<p>This means we'd want to balance mistakes and OKs in the people we'd want the sign to used by.</p>

<p>The library recognizes an unusual risk, so they decide to put up warning signs. However, due to the novelty of the risk, they decide they need to not just signal a generic "warning" but to actually <humor-outcome>support the argument (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. Recognizing that this is a humor outcome, the library recognizes that designing this sign is in part a humor task.</p> 

<p>How can the sign-makers go about generating humor? They could try to generate humor by doing something "funny." But they instead decide to focus on reaching the humor outcome directly—an <strong>outcome-first method</strong>.</p>
 
 <p>
Once they decide this, they don't need to think about "humor" at all&mdash;no need for jokes, comics, cartoon characters, self-reference, or other things stereotypically thought of as "funny." They instead just focus all their efforts on <humor-outcome>supporting an argument.</humor-outcome> <callback>("If our argument is supported, they'll feel humor.")</callback>
 </p> 

<p>This means they focus foremost on presenting a compelling argument. They laid out the reasons for caution, with an implied negative consequences if caution isn't exercised.</p>
 
<p>This has to balance mistakes and OKs. They callibrate these by considering their audience <callback>(literate parents)</callback> and thinking about its location <callback>(a library)</callback>. This lets them think about balancing mistakes and OKs in this context for these specific people, while trying to avoid leading to mistake-predominance or OK-predominance.</p>

<p>Nothing about this sign on the surface is funny, frivolous, insincere, sarcastic, or other things we may associate with comedy. But we saw in a previous example that Justin laughed at this sign—and his humor shows he reaches humor outcome tripwires.</p> 
    
    <p>Among other things, he thought the sign <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>&mdash;and his humor is an indication that the sign was implemented correctly.</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>The transit company above wanted to <humor-outcome>support an argument  (that caution should be exercised)</humor-outcome>. To reach this humor outcome, they could have focused making a strong argument for caution <callback>(outcome-first: "if they feel our argument is supported, they'll feel humor")</callback>. But instead, they used a cartoony allegory to try to balance mistakes and OK <callback>(emotion-first: "if they feel humor, they'll feel our argument is supported")</callback>.</p>

<p>How did they decide between these methods? They thought about their target audience and how people would use their sign. They knew people may not spend much time looking at this sign, so they wanted to avoid long text or complicated visuals to support their argument. They also knew that not all the people they're trying to reach can read Turkish. So they decide on something visual that can be interpreted fairly quickly.</p>

<p>So they decide an emotion-first method would best help them in this context.</p>

<p>So that means they focus first on balancing mistakes and OKs, and don't bother thinking about this in terms of <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>. So they think about how to deviate from someone's expectations&mdash;which they do by showing a bumbling figure carelessly skipping toward an ambushing Death.</p> 

<p>To balance out this mistake, they raise our OK by using an abstract and cartoonish style, and imply the negative consequences for the future. Our disassociation from the character and outcome lets us feel more secure from negative personal consequences.</p>  

<p>The designers have to callibrate mistakes and OKs based on their audience. For instance, they can make the sign more or less like other warning signs to modulate the mistake&mdash;or make the drawing more or less realistic to modulate the OK. If the audience feels humor generated by a relevant topic, they'll have <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome> and accomplished their goal.</p>
                           
                           
        
<div class="content-example">                         
<p>Task: A church wants to prevent cars cutting through their parking lot. So they decide to make a sign to that effect. How do they go about making an effective sign?</p>
            
<p>They start by thinking about they want their sign to achieve: they want to <humor-outcome>control/influence situations (by making drivers voluntarily stop cutting through)</humor-outcome>. In other words, the church wants their sign to generate humor.</p>

<p>They think about the most obvious sign they could think of <callback>("no cutting through")</callback>&mdash;and decide this probably wouldn't generate humor in a way that influenced a situation as much as they would like.</p> 

<p>So they think about using an outcome-first method of design. They brainstorm some of the most obvious ways to rush humor outcome tripwires&mdash;like by listing stats to <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>; using a graphic of elderly or young church goers to <humor-outcome>share a perspective</humor-outcome>; bonding with readers by <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome><callback> ("hey, good neighbor!—please don't cut through")</callback>; and so on.</p> 

<p>They evaluate these approaches for suitability. Most of them have drawbacks: graphics are expensive to commission; stats take space to present effectively (especially to people in cars who are distant and fast-moving); elaborate sentences take time to read (which drivers don't always have); and so on.</p>

<p>So they set aside outcome-first methods, and brainstorm emotion-first methods. They take their standard idea <callback>("no cutting through")</callback> and think about how they could make it deviate from people's expectations. They think about adding colors, using an unusual shape or size, choosing an odd font, using odd phrasing; using slang; reverse psychology; and so on.</p>

<p>None of these emotion-first methods add much velocity toward a <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> tripwire. But they <em>do</em> have the advantage of meshing with the constraints of their sign.</p>

<p>So they pick a few of the emotion-first ideas that they thought were thematically relevant to the church. They use gothic script and archaic English to make a sign that says "Thou Shall Not Cut Through." They make an emotional forecast that many drivers would have balanced mistakes and OKs at this sign, which would reduce the rate of cutting through by <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>.

<p>Notice that these two methods "outcome-first" and "emotion-first" aren't actually distinct categories—they're just practical ways of relating ourselves to the same process, and gaining different perspectives on how and why we generate humor.</p>

<p>Sometimes these observations go against how we think interactions are supposed to work. This can make them seem confusing or mysterious. But once we know how to think about it, the humor in these situations isn’t confusing or mysterious.</p>

<p>The people in these examples are just using outcome-first methods of generating humor. They’re rushing humor outcome tripwires like <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, or so on—and the high velocity rushes the comments across tripwires before anyone can deflect them.</p> 

<p>This isn't random, unknowable, or at all outside any normal pattern of humor—it's just humor like it always is. It's not breaking any laws of social physics.</p>

<p>Still, at first these these sharp, outcome-first humor attempts might seem like gambles—like someone is rolling the dice on whether someone feels anger or humor from these comments. But there’s actually very little gambling in the examples above&mdash;since everyone had high confidence that the person they were talking to would laugh and not be offended.</p> 

<p>We already know what this feels like, like when we <em>know</em> whether or not someone will feel humor before we make a comment:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*putting on tie*</action> <action>*walking into bedroom*</action> <speech>“And how are you today, my little crab cake?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam knows Jennifer will laugh at this)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“That’s the worst one yet!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    </div>
    
<p>When Sam uses a joke nickname with Jennifer, he isn't sweating and crossing his fingers. <callback>("Oh god oh god I hope this lands")</callback> He already knows Jennifer will laugh!</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>--> 
    <p>If he thought she’d be annoyed, he wouldn’t have said it—and even if she’s unexpectedly out of sorts, he’s not worried about his ability to adapt to it.</p>
</div> 

<p>This feeling of future confidence is the same feeling everyone in our examples had when they made their sharp comments. Each person had practiced a similar kind of comment with many different kinds of people in similar situations over and over:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Elias often flirts with strangers</li>
    <li>Amber often comments on physical appearances of strangers</li>
    <li>Emma is often direct with people</li>
    <li>the waiter deals with dozens of customers each day</li>
    <li>Timothy delivers bad news to patients all the time</li>
    <li>the tutor works with many students each day</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>This constant practice gave them the skill to have a pretty good idea of the emotional outcome in advance. In the same way Sam and Jennifer's constant interaction lets them have high confidence in outcomes, the tutor's constant interaction with clients lets them have high confidence in outcomes.</p>

<p>These comments only <term>appear</term> to be acts of courageous spontaneity <term2>if</term2> we see them as an isolated, single instance—instead of part of a practiced skill.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    
    <!--<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>-->
    
    <p>If we watched a baseball game and thought all the college athletes were playing for the first time, it would seem like an astonishing, out-of-the-blue miracle to watch them catch a fly ball.</p>
    
    <p>But instead, when we watch college baseball we know the players have spent a decade practicing those specific skills. We're still impressed by their dedication and upper-end perfomance. But we don't think that their ability to do so arrived mysteriously from nowhere that very moment.</p>
             
    <p>It's the same thing for humor. It's not an astonishing miracle when Amber makes the server laugh. <callback>("You look terrible.")</callback> It only looks that way if we think the ability to do so arrived mysteriously from nowhere that very moment&mdash;when instead, it's something she's spent years or even decades practicing.</p>
</div>

<p>How does the tutor knows in advance which student will respond in which way?</p>

<p>Partially, the tutor judges how disposed a client seems to defend certain tripwires. This lets the tutor decide which topics to try to generate humor on, and how. With enough clients and practice, the tutor develops an intuitive skill at this.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    <!--<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>-->
    
    <p>If a student is arrogant, controlling, demanding, defensive, proud, and so on, they may resist being rushed across <humor-outcome>controlled the situation</humor-outcome> tripwire. In this case, the tutor may focus first on <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <p>But if a student seems to be looking for advice, is nervous, unsure of what to do, uncertain of the quality of their work, willing to put in more work, and so on—then the tutor may judge that they can rush them across <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome> tripwires, and in a way the student will appreciate and find productive and positive.</p> </div>

<p>It’s the same for the other examples. Elias, Emma, Amber, Timothy, and the waiter knew in advance how the specific people they were talking too would react. They knew what the likely outcome would be, and were confident they could handle outlier outcomes.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>Sometimes this outcome-first humor confuses us because of its apparent negativity, like when Amber criticized someone. <callback>(“You look terrible.”)</callback> But our confusion is caused by an incorrect assumption: that we only feel humor at “good” things, and that we shouldn't feel humor at “bad” things.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>But as we’ve seen, humor doesn’t distinguish straightforwardly between “good” and “bad.” All that matters is how much something deviates from our expectations, and whether that’s matched by our sense of security from negative personal consequences.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>If the server feels secure from negative personal consequences, we don’t need to think about ideas like “good” or “bad.” Questions like <callback>“was it good or bad for Amber to make that comment?”</callback> or <callback>"is it good or bad to be told we look terrible?"</callback> aren't relevant to thinking about why someone does or doesn't feel humor.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>We can probably find places in our own lives where others would view our own humor skills as miraculous—we just don’t notice this because these skills seem so utterly normal to us, like how we interact with:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>new coworkers</li>
    <li>freshmen teammates</li>
    <li>young children</li>
    <li>patients</li>
    <li>long-standing clients</li>
    <li>online friends</li>
    <li>social media comments</li>
    <li>vendors</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">and so on</p> 

<p>Through experience, exposure, feedback, opportunity, practice, and so on, we’ve picked up an ability to gauge outcomes around these people. This lets us act in ways that can seem miraculous to others—especially if someone confuses our years of familiarity and practice for some kind of exceptional, one-off ability.</p> 

<p>By themselves, these sharper skills with humor are neither good nor bad. Sometimes they’re used for negative manipulation. Other times, we start relying on them, and we fall into a rut that prevents us from practicing other ways of relating to others. And sometimes we overextend ourselves—or trick ourselves into thinking we’re better at a sharp social skill than we really are.</p> 

<p>But what <em>is</em> good is understanding how all this happens. It can help us deal with the humor we feel unexpectedly from high-velocity experiences, including when it’s part of negative manipulation—as well as reducing how often humor strikes us as confusing or mysterious.</p>
