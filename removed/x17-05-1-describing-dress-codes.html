    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Agreement on a dress code creates stability</h1>
         
<p>We often set dress codes in subtle ways&mdash;like when we give a half-hearted smile instead of a full smile. But other times we have explicit disagreements about it. We may ask that someone “be serious”&mdash;a request that they raise their standard of fittedness.</p>
 
 <p>When we arrive at a shared understanding of a situation's need for effectiveness and cohesion, we feel good on an emotion network&mdash;when we don't arrive at a shared understanding, things feel destructive:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narrative>Emma pulls out her phone, but is stupefied to see she accidentally grabbed Owen’s phone. Zoe doubles over with laughter at Emma’s expression.</narrative></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(stupefied)</internalaction> <speech>“It’s not funny! Where’s my phone?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Zoe laughs harder, and Emma gets more and more annoyed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Emma disagree about the need for effectiveness and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“I wish you would take this seriously.”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Okay, okay, sorry.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Emma are able to finalize a dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“I wish you would take this seriously.”</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“You should see your face right now! Shocked Pikachu.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe and Emma are unable to finalize a dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“…”</speech></p>
    
    </div>
    



<p>When we <term>agree</term> with the wider, finalized dress code, we can comfortably join the emotion network and synchronize in a ways that feel acceptable to everyone, including ourselves.</p> 

<p>When we <term2>don’t</term2> agree to the finalized dress code, we often feel uncomfortable and unintegrated—and we’ll leave as quickly if we can, and won’t want to return to these emotion networks.</p> 

<p>The exact dress code is never precise—instead, a dress code functions with ambiguity, disagreements, conflicting motivations, inconsistent enforcement, incomplete consensus, and so on.</p> 

<p>At first, it might seem dress codes function <term>despite</term> this ambiguity—but they actually function <term2>because</term2> of this ambiguity.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>Sometimes, we associate ambiguity with disorder or inefficiency. But in this case, the ambiguity gives us the flexibility needed for rich functionality. It allows for broad participation, consensus-seeking, exploration of boundaries, information-sharing, multiple ways of integrating, and so on.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Describing.</headline> We already have plenty of ways to describe dress codes in our day-to-day language—especially when we disagree with them. When we think the dress code is too <term>high</term>, we use words like <callback>buzzkill, joyless, snooty, stuck-up</callback>. When we think the dress code is too <term2>low</term2>, we use words like <callback>disrespectful, flippant, informal, permissive, unserious,</callback> and so on.</p>

    <p>If a group seems <callback>snooty</callback> to us, the dress code is higher that we feel like agreeing to—and we won’t want to to fully join the emotion network. Of course, to the people there, it doesn’t feel <callback>snooty</callback> in a bad way—they’ve agreed to a high dress code for reasons that seem justified to them.</p>
    
    <p>When we don’t agree with the dress code, we often either resist it or don’t know how to conform—and either way, we feel out of place.</p>
