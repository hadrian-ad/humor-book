<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor shows concord in learning</h1>


<p>We talked before about 
    
    We talked before about how each emotional zone had a different timbre of influence. There's coercive influence <callback>(mistake-predominant influence)</callback> and intertial influence <callback>(OK-predominant influence)</callback>. In-between them is <em>concordant</em> influence <callback>(humor influence)</callback>.</p>
    
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Etymology:</p>
        <p class="considertext">Concord etymologically means something like <callback>"hearts (moving in the same direction) together."</callback>
    </div> 
    
    <p>Concord is what makes humor outcomes humor outcomes. We can be <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>forced to</outcome-contrast> gain perspectives</humor-outcome> by having someone set our house on fire&mdash;but we only <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>concordantly</outcome-contrast> gain perspectives</humor-outcome> when we feel humor.</p>  
    
    
    <p>This helps us understand what we mean when we say we only learn when we feel humor and vice versa. What's happening is that we feel an <humor-outcome>argument has been (concordantly) supported</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>new perspectives have been (concordantly) gained</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>other ideas have been (concordantly) criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>complaints about other ideas have been (concordantly) handled</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>rapport has been (concordantly) created with us</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>We may touch a hot stove and "learn" something, but this is a coerced gained perspective&mdash;it's not until a minute passes and we smile through our pain that the perspective starts to be concordantly gained. </p>
    
    <p>Similarly, we can pass a driver's license examination by the boring memorization of pointless facts <callback>(“Begin braking at least 300 feet from a stop sign…”)</callback> This might either be coercive or intertial "learning," but in this book there's only one concordant way to learn&mdash;humor.</p>
    
    <p>
    
    <p>It's this concord that produces feeling of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on, which constitute the mechanism of new perspectives being incorporated.</p>
