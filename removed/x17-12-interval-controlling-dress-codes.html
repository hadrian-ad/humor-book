<p>Sometimes we think that we should be able to <em>rationalize</em> humor or humor dress codes—perhaps through lists of permitted and forbidden content. But this misunderstands humor and emotions more generally.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <!--<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>-->
    <p>We know we can’t verbally promise ourselves that we won’t be angry or sad next week—or sign a binding contract that we’ll only feel happiness next week. These promises or contracts wouldn’t do anything!</p>
</div> 

<p>For similar reasons, we can’t sign a contract determining what we’ll find fitted or unfitted in the future. We can’t control humor dress codes in this way!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>This doesn’t stop people from trying. For instance, during the French revolution, the constitutional assembly formally banned laughter at their meetings.</p> 
       
       <p>Their goal was to become more effective, deliberative, grave, rational, and so on—but interestingly, an unfollowable rule brought them further away from all of those things. Laughter continued, and there really wasn’t anything formal rules could do about it.
        </p>

<p>The constitutional assembly was attempting to control humor dress codes through dictate, not through emotional collaboration—but this never works.</p> 

</div>

<p>Even though we can't control emotional dress codes by dictate, people still try all the time:</p>



<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Stephen calls an all-staff meeting.</narration>
    </p>
    
    <p><speaker>Stephen:</speaker> <speech>“There will be no laughing during all-hands meeting. None. Got it? We’re going to spend the rest of the hour figuring out what’s happening in research. We don’t have time for nonsense.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Stephen tries to set a dress code in advance)</notes></p>
</div>



<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Tucker calls an all-staff meeting.</narration>
    </p>
    
    <p><speaker>Tucker:</speaker> <speech>“Now I want us to have fun. We have to laugh. No frown-y faces. C’mon everyone. Let’s laugh. Ha ha ha! Amber, why don’t you start us off with a joke? Anything goes!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Tucker tries to set a dress code in advance)</notes></p>
</div>


<p>Stephen is trying to set the dress code so high that any humor would be seen as unfitted <callback>(and so censured)</callback>—Tucker wants to set it so low that any humor or humor attempt would be fitted <callback>(and so <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> censured)</callback>. The problem is that dress codes aren’t something Stephen or Tucker have centralized control over.</p>

<div class="consider">
<!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->

<p>This is obvious with something like sadness. We can't just wave our hands to set what things people around us see as justifiably sad. The exact same reason we can't control the <term>sadness</term> dress code, we can't controll the <term2>humor</term2> dress code.</p>
    </div>

<p>When we think we should be able to set dress codes unilaterally, we don't just low-rank others—we won’t succeed either!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>If we want to raise a dress code, everyone around us will need to have a non-theoretical reason for increased efficiency and cohesion. It’s not enough for <term>Stephen</term> to feel a need for efficiency and cohesion—since the dress code is set by <term2>everyone</term2>. In a room of twenty people, Stephen is only 1/20th of the opinion on this.</p>

    <p>The dress code won't raise until <term>everyone</term> present <term2>also</term2> agrees on the need for increased efficiency and cohesion. It's the same for Tucker—it’s not until everyone else sees a need for less efficiency or cohesion that the dress code would actually lower like Tucker wants.</p>
    </div>

<p>At best, Stephen could try to <term>censor</term>—rather than <term2>censure</term2>—humor. He could try to force people to behave <em>as if</em> the dress code was a certain way, but this is a bit like making people enjoy our birthday party at gunpoint—the picture of what he wants only.</p>

<p>If the staff is cowed, they may censor themselves the way Stephen wants—but this is different than Stephen actually setting the dress code for them. He’d just compelling behavior, not changing what they internally recognize as fitted or unfitted.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>Teachers often do this with students. When students don't feel any need for efficiency or cohesion, they lower their dress code and goof off. Instead of <term>addressing</term> the cause of their lower dress code <callback>(boredom, lack of perceived need for efficiency or cohesion)</callback>, the teacher tries to <term2>force</term2> them to not goof off <callback>(censor)</callback>. The teacher is trying to enforce a dictated dress code in a way that goes against how dress codes are actually set.</p>
    
    
        <p>Sometimes teachers think classes need to get serious <callback>(raise a dress code)</callback> before they get started, but this is often backwards—we actually need to get started before we get serious. That's because moving into an activity that requires greater cohesion and efficiency will naturally raise the dress code—while simply yelling at people to knock it off tries to ineffectively force a dress code through censoring.</p>
</div>
    
    
    <p>Sometimes, we think humor is counterproductive—but that's wrong. <term>Fitted</term> humor is by <term2>definition</term2> productive—it’s doing many things at once in a way that meets the current minimum standard.</p>


<p>If we can't distinguish between fitted and unfitted humor, and so tried to censure <em>all</em> humor, we'd be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Removing all humor would be a solution that creates problems.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    <p>Sometimes we think we can get rid of dress codes, like when we go to an anything goes comedy club. But that’s an illusion: any group of people will always form dress codes.</p> 
    
    <p>This is why an audience that's hungry for taboo jokes will still censure annoying laughter in the audience, or why members of a boundary-pushing meme forum will still censure people making fun of members a certain way.</p> 
    
    <p> That's because humor dress codes haven't gone away, and those audiences haven't been exempted from the normal process that sets them!</p> 
    
    <p>Similarly, instead of lowering a dress code some people try to raise them. Simply saying a topic is off-limits doesn't turn off our ability to find fitted humor attempts on that topic fitted.</p>
</div>

<p>When we understand how dress codes work, we can better influence them or make sense of why people are behaving the way they are. When we see people having fun when we think they should be serious, or being serious where we think they should be having fun, we don't <em>only</em> need to be frustrated—since their dress code gives us insight into how they’re seeing the world around them.</p>

<p>This information lets us make changes to our approach or to our environment in ways that accords with how people work. This is genuine leadership on an emotion network—and not simply flailing with censorship, trying to ban or force changes to humor in ways that conflict with how we work.</p>
