    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">12. Emotion network</h2>
    
   
  
<p>All social animals feel humor. At first, it can seem weird to say this outright, without hedging—but it’s only weird if we think that humor is about jokes; satire; wit; resolving existential tension through art; or so on. Obviously, animals don’t appreciate puns in comedic movies like we do.</p>

<p>But just because <term>animals</term> don't appreciate comedic movies doesn't mean they don't feel humor. <term2>Babies</term2> can’t appreciate comedic movies either—but we still say they feel humor <callback>(they smile and laugh)</callback>, even though no five-month-old has ever written a script or made a witty comment. That’s because we intuitively know that humor is something separate from verbal language.</p>

<p>In the same vein, it wouldn’t make sense to say other animals don’t feel humor either—just because they don’t laugh at comedic dialogue or make witty comments.</p> 

<p>Our model of humor applies fairly well to non-human animals:</p>



<h3>Mistakes and OKs</h3> 
 
<div class="h2">
    <p>Animals feel humor when the size of their mistakes and OKs match. When they don’t match, they feel mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotions instead:</p>
    
     
    
    <p><strong>mistake-predominant emotions</strong></p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p>
            <narration>Trevor shouts as he loses a match. General Zod looks up, startled.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>
        </p> 
        <p>
            <narration>Zod is worried.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is not OK)</notes> <narration>He puts his head on his paws and he glances around, concerned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is larger than OK&harr;mistake-predominant emotions)</notes>
        </p>
    </div> 
    
     
    
    <p><strong>balanced emotions</strong></p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor shouts as he loses a match. General Zod looks up, startled.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes> <narration>Zod sees everything’s fine.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is OK)</notes> <narration>He relaxes and wags his tail.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is OK&harr;humor)</notes>
    </p> </div>
    
     
    
    <p><strong>OK-predominant emotions</strong></p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p>
            <narration>Trevor shouts as he loses a match. General Zod doesn’t even register it.</narration> <notes>(&larr;no mistake)</notes> <narration>Trevor does this every night.</narration> <notes>(&larr;OK is larger than mistake&harr;OK-predominant emotions)</notes>
        </p>
    </div>  
    
    
    
    <p>We see similar things with any social animal:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>apes investigate things</li>
        <li>bear cubs wrestle with each other</li>
        <li>cats play with mice</li>
        <li>crows try to pull animal tails</li>
        <li>dogs see people return early</li>
        <li>dolphins explore novelty</li>
        <li>elephants perform pranks</li>
        <li>fawns explore fields</li>
        <li>monkeys observe behavior</li>
        <li>otters push things around</li>
        <li>parrots are mischievous</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    
    <p>In all these cases, we have the same forking outcomes: sometimes the mistake is too large, and they become defensive—other times the OK is too large, and they get bored. When the mistake and OK balance, they feel humor.</p>
</div>

 

<h3>Generating humor</h3> 
 
<div class="h2">
    <p>Animals intentionally try to generate humor. We already have words for this, like “play.” An animal that’s playing is intentionally enlarging mistakes or shrinking an OK to generate humor.</p>
    
     
    
    <div class="for-instance">
        <consider>For instance:</consider>
        <p>When fawns have a large OK, they’ll prance to create large mistake and generate humor. Cats will intentionally generate humor by playing with mice or string. “Playing” is a context-specific word for trying to generate humor.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Like in humans, humor indicates the Goldilocks experiential zone—not too much mistake, not too much OK. When intentionally pursued <callback>("play")</callback>, it’s the sweet spot where we’re exploring something while also mitigating risk. Humor is part of how we communicate our relation to this sweet spot to others.</p>
    
    <div class="for-instance">
     
     <consider>For instance:</consider>
     
     <p>When bear cubs, dog puppies, or human kids wrestle, they’ll use humor to calibrate themselves into this Goldilocks zone. Too much mistake, and they’ll slow up. Too much OK, they’ll go a bit harder. Their emotion network helps them arrive at the place between too consequential and not consequential enough—which is how we play.</p></div>
    
     
    
    <p>Other times, animals don't intentionally generate humor, but their humor "rings" like a convenience store bell, signalling their transition between mistake-predominant and OK-predominant emotions—like how General Zod is first startled by Trevor <callback>(mistake-predominance)</callback>, and then transitions back to being placid <callback>(OK-predominance)</callback>. Zod has to "ring" through humor to make this transition.</p>
</div>




 

<h3>Humor family words</h3> 

<div class="h2">
    <p>We can use humor family words to think about where animals feel humor. For instance, dogs and cats feel humor when they feel <emotions>achievement</emotions> <callback>(successful hunting)</callback>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions> <callback>(petting)</callback>, <emotions>comfort</emotions> <callback>(warmth)</callback>, <emotions>connection</emotions> <callback>(attention)</callback>, <emotions>generosity</emotions> <callback>(treats)</callback>, <emotions>relief</emotions> <callback>(removal of something stressful)</callback>, <emotions>welcome</emotions> <callback>(inviting a dog up on furniture)</callback>, and so on.</p>
</div>



<h3>Humor tells</h3> 

<div class="h2">
    <p>Social animals have humor tells too. They'll consistently show humor tells when mistakes are OK, like by:</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>seeking out other animals</li>
        <li>touching each other</li>
        <li>making contented noises</li>
        <li>making loud noises</li>
        <li>losing awareness of what’s around them</li>
        <li>moving non-normatively</li>
        <li>becoming bolder</li>
        <li>relaxing</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
</div>

 

<h3>Humor profiles</h3> 
 
<div class="h2">
    <p>Each species has their own species humor profile. Within that template, each member of that species has their own individual humor profile. This is like how all dogs wag their tails, but each dog wags their tail a bit differently from every other dog.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>Animal humor profiles don’t usually look much like a human humor profile. Dogs can emote in ways that have nuance to us, but the nuance of the evaluatory information of a cat is less readable to us—the nuance of the evaluatory information of a crow even less.</p>
</div>



<h3>Emotion networks</h3> 
 
<div class="h2">
    <p>We can use emotion networks to understand why animals feel humor. Social animals have emotion networks so they can form groups and share evaluatory information with each other.</p>
    
     
    
    <div class="for-instance">
        <consider>For instance:</consider>
         
         <p> Crows will spread out across a field to eat—and if one crow notices a mistake, the others pick up on this too through their emotional network. If many crows are anxious, but one becomes calm, the others will calm down too. If they can’t synchronize, they squabble.</p>
    </div>
    
     
    
    <p>In this case, humor isn’t some exceptional side-development that exists apart from “normal” function. Instead, humor is just part and parcel of an emotion network—and humor is like one frequency of how animals communicate evaluations.</p>
</div>



<p>Even though our model applies relatively well to animals, it’s sometimes still uncomfortable to say outright that non-human animals feel humor. The specific worry is that it’s anthropomorphizing them in ways that aren’t useful.</p> 

<p>Whatever the merits of that concern, it’s worth noticing that this is putting a double standard on <em>humor</em> that we don’t for other emotions.</p> 

<p>In our day-to-day lives, we describe animals as feeling afraid, anxious, bored, curious, playful, lonely, social, stressed, and so on. And while we have normal uncertainty about what animals are “really” feeling <callback>(“how similar is cat stress to human stress?”)</callback>, we don’t usually see words like “boredom” or “stress” as inherently bad ways of discussing or understanding their behavior in day-to-day conversation.</p>

<p>We should put humor in this same category too, since humor is just a normal, regular emotion! It’s no more or less weird to say animals feels humor than it is to say they feel fear. In this sense, humor is as good or as bad as any other emotional description.</p>

<p>The wider point to all this isn’t actually about <term>animals</term>, but about <term2>us</term2>—and how we think about humor. When we understand how humor can sensibly apply to animals—even though they can’t tell jokes—we’re ready to more deeply understand how humor applies to us in our lives.</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>Trevor would struggle to understand humor if he can’t escape a learned connection between humor and jokes:</p>
    
     
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*scratching General Zod*</action> <speech>“I think animals feel humor.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“No they don’t! If they did, we’d market comedies to them!”</speech> <speaker>(&larr;Trevor thinks humor means laughing at comedic movies)</speaker></p>
    
     
    
    <p>Trevor’s essentially making a non sequitur—a bit like saying animals must not feel hunger because they never made pizzerias! </p>
</div>


<p>Humor is part of a broader system, where communication, evaluations, groups, and senses all relate together. It allows us to make assessments about the world around us, and quickly communalize those assessments—something that allows groups to form and function well.</p> 

<p>In that light, it’s not surprising that social animals would have similar ways of sharing information together, whether those animals are humans or crows—including through humor.</p>

<p>To a greater degree than other animals, humans combine their emotion network with a complementing system of language, which allows us to topicalize our evaluatory information. Even though this gives a distinctive layer to our interactions relative to other animals, the foundation is still a similar system that exists for similar reasons among all social animals.</p>
