<p>People have informational tension between them. As people increase their attention to each other’s emotional state, they increase this informational tension—pulling them together. This <vocab>human surface tension</vocab> is what makes groups groups:</p>

<p>We can see the degrees of human surface tension any time we look at any groups of people:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma are walking down the campus quad, arguing about which dinosaur would make the best pet.</narration> <notes>(&larr;high surface tension)</notes></p> 
    
    <p>
        <narration>They pass someone relaxing on a bench. They register basic things about that person’s emotional state, but don’t put in any more effort to register his evaluatory state.</narration> <notes>(&larr;low surface tension)</notes>
    </p>

     >



<p>We increase or decrease this informational tension by how much mutual attention we give each other:</p>

<p>Human surface tension lets us think about what makes individual people part of groups—and how subnetworks form and fluctuate on an emotion network:</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>These groupings are fluid and can quickly change over time—since we’re constantly changing which people we put effort into sharing and receiving information with.</p> 

<p>We can see arrangements, degrees, and changes of human surface tension whenever we look at anyone. We can see this in some pictures:</p>

<p>In each of these pictures, the human surface tension is fluid and tangible—it's the constantly changing degree of informational exchange between people. </p>

<p>One of the ways we improve at generating humor is by improving our awareness and control around human surface tension. We enable connective, precise humor by increasing our informational tension with someone—otherwise, we simply have no way to reactively shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor.</p>

<p>Our ability to handle human surface tension is what enables us to form or disband groups. This skill is broader than just "humor," but is essential at any skill around humor.</p>
