Evaluatory Screens
</h1>

<p>To think about spectator entertainment, we can use emotion networks:</p>

<p>We can add seperate <sem-weak>spectators</sem-weak> of this emotion network:</p>

<p>When Trevor and Yasmin watch <book-title>Squeal II</book-title>, <term>they</term> can recieve evaluatory information from the <term>characters</term>, but the <term2>characters</term2> can't from <term2>them</term2>.</p>

<p>Above, there's a <vocab>screen</vocab> that filters evaluatory information&mdash;this screen creates these different emotion networks.</p>
  
<p>Evaluatory screens be impermeable or permeable. This is why shouting at actors in a <term>movie</term> has a different result than shouting at actors in a <term2>play</term2>:</p>

     <p>We can see all kinds of evaluatory screens:</p>
      
    <ul class="close-list">
         <li>A play has a <em>pretend</em> screen, where the actors recieve evaluatory information but by-and-large  carry on as if they didn't recieve any</li>
          
          <li>A movie has as <em>absolute</em> screen, where the characters will never recieve evaluatory information</li>
          
          <li>A car window is a <em>barrier</em> screen, where more evaluatory information could be let out by lowering it</li> 
          
          <li>An athletic game has a <em>concentration</em> screen, where participants need so much focus that they can't focus on the audience</li></ul>
      
      <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
          
<div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
    

<p>Spectator entertainment with <term>permeable</term> screens <callback>(like in-person performances)</callback> often gives us the feeling of <term>including</term> us, which makes them feel vivid and interesting. Things with permeable screens feel dynamic, and allow for  reactive participation.</p> 
   
   <p>By contrast, spectator entertainment with <term2>impermeable</term2> screens <callback>(like remotely viewed performances)</callback> often has the feeling of <term2>excluding</term2> us, which makes them feel lifeless or grating outside of specific circumstances.</p> 
   
    </div>
   

   
<div class="box"><p><headline>Screens.</headline> An evaluatory screen doesn't mean something is spectator entertainment. Something is only spectator entertainment when the <em>priority</em> is on one group&mdash;and there may or may not be a screen.</p> 
             
    <p>If a salesman flatters us, there <term>isn't</term> a screen&mdash;but since the priority is us, it <term>is</term> spectator entertainment. Similarly, if we watch street life from our window, there <term2>is</term2> an evaluatory screen but since the priority isn't us it <term2>isn't</term2> spectator entertainment.</p>
              </div>

  
  

<!--   
<p>We like things with impermeable screens when we have control over when, where, and how we watch them. Things we don't have control over feel destructive to emotional life, like advertisement videos at gas stations, recorded training videos, TVs on at restaurants, and so on.</p>

   <!--
   Appendix? Second read through         
   <p>The way that things engage with the evaluatory information of its audience plays a large role in how we sort them by entertainment genre or category.</p>
  
<p class="for-instance">For instance</p>
  
 <p>Something like a play or open mic will involve selective engagement with evaluatory information. Stage actors will pause for laughter, but not smile because of it.

    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Emotional templates.</headline> This chapter is focused on spectator entertainment. This is when the goal is the emotional experience of the audience.</p>

<p>Something like an Ultimate practice is not spectator entertainment, because the goal isn't what spectators feel watching practice </p>
 
<p>Instead, Ultimate practice has an observed emotion network&mdash;we can describe it from Emma and Zoe's perspective with a spectator template&mdash;but it's not spectator entertainment.</p> 

    <p>We now have two things: spectator <term>entertainment</term>, and spectater <term2>templates</term2>. What's the difference?</p>
 
<p>The difference is <em>goals</em>. If we watch a play, the goal of everyone there is to prioritize our experience as the audience.  <callback>(Spectator template that's also spectator entertainment.)</callback></p> 
    
<p>But if we watch people from our window, the goal of everyone there is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> to prioritize our experience as the audience. <callback>(Spectator template that's <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> also spectator entertainment.)</callback></p>  

<p>Spectator templates are common things that happen all the time. Students in classrooms; friends listening to friends bicker; patrons vaguely aware of the table over; and so on&mdash;all normal parts of daily life, where we float between different levels of mutual reactivity.</p>
   
<p>By contrast, spectator entertainment uses this template, but <em>also</em> alters the goals and priorities to varying degrees. This makes it a rarer version of a spectator template:</p>

<!--
<p>Similarly, it's not spectator entertainment when we watch our friends argue or overhear a discussion the table over. We're in a spectator <term>template</term>, because we're removed from the mutual interaction—but since our emotions aren't the priority of what we're observing, it's not spectator <term2>entertainment</term2>.
