<p>Throughout this book, we'll use examples to point out humor:</p>

<p>We can expand what we mean by "humor" by looking at the <vocab>universal pattern</vocab> of humor&mdash;which we'll be looking at the rest of this chapter.</p> 






<!--

Laughing isn't random&mdash;there's a pattern to why we laugh. We'll introduce this pattern in this chapter.

This is a starting place for refinement.




The elephant problem.

There are two main challenges to studying humor dynamics. 

The first is how <term>familiar</term> it all is&mdash;it's a bit like having to look at our own nose, or to pay attention to our breathing.
 
The second is how <em>vast</em> it is. It's a bit like the story of the blind men who try to figure out what an elephant is by each touching a different part of it. This leads to contradictions that seem hard to consolidate. <callback>("It's a tree trunk!" "No, it's a rope!")</callback></p>

So humor is an elephant-problem.

We simply don't always pay attention to everywhere we smile and laugh. We may notice we smile at a joke&mdash;but then not notice that we smile when we see our friend.

But to understand humor, we'll need a life-accurate sample of our 


<p>In this chapter, we'll start defining humor&mdash;by defining <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> there's humor:</p>

                           Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'

<p>If similar things happen to people, that doesn't mean there's humor equally:</p>

    <p>Sometimes we don't think there's rhyme or reason to all this&mdash;but there's a pattern to when there's humor.</p> 
    
    <p>We'll be looking at this pattern the rest of this chapter.</p>
    
    <!--
    <p>we'll always involve people&mdash;so not just <term>signs</term> themselves, but <em>people</em> looking at the signs.</p>
 
    
    <p>We'll be going over humor dynamics from beginning to end, so that you'll finish substantially better at observing, describing understanding, and producing humor than when you started.</p>
    

<p>It'll be at least somewhat fun and very interesting&mdash;you'll see!</p>
