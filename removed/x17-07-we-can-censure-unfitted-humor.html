<p>We have a specific way of censuring someone: we don't synchronize fully with them.</p>    

<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
     <p>We experience desynchronization as censure. That's because we <em>want</em> others to synchronize or be synchronized with us.</p>

  <p>Practically, this often simply means not expressing an equal amount of humor tells:</p>

        <p>Essentially, someone shares an evaluatory perspective. By showing disagreement with that perspective, we censure them. It's this evaluatory disagreement that's censure.</p>



<div class="consider">
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>We're using a lighter definition of "censure" than how we often use it in day-to-day conversations. Our censure here is almost never room-stopping conflict&mdash;more often it's just a half-smile contrasting with someone's full smile. <callback>("Censure")</callback></p>
    
    <p>Most of the censure we receive in our day-to-day lives aren't a big deal to us—it's just something done by everyone, including us and our friends or family, in ways we think of as neither good nor bad, but just how things work.</p>
