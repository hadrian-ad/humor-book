15. Explaining humor 
</h1>

    <p>Last chapter, we looked at <a href="../14chapter-humor-outcomes/14-00-humor-outcomes.html">humor outcomes</a>&mdash;ways of describing humor as an outcome.</p>
            
<div class="listbox">
   <p class="listbox-headline">Humor outcomes</p>
         
    <p><i>acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</i></p>
    </div>
    
<p>In this chapter, we'll look at how these descriptions double as <vocab>explanations</vocab> for humor:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Zoe is browsing the bookstore, and finds a book called <book-title>Wherever You Go, There You Are</book-title>. She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    
       </div>
        
<p>Why did Zoe feel humor? We can say she encountered a mistake that balanced with an OK&mdash;but we can also use humor outcomes to answer this question: since she <humor-outcome>gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, we can look for what that new perspective might be.</p>
    

    

 
<p>We'll be talking about this in the rest of this chapter.</p>
 
        
        <div class="box">
<p>
   <headline>Tether.</headline> When explaining Zoe’s humor, we <term>first</term> start with a humor outcome. <callback>(“Zoe gained a new perspective.”)</callback> We <term2>then</term2> think about <em>why</em> something did that for Zoe specifically. <callback>(“What about this title was a new perspective for <em>her</em>?”)</callback> 
   </p>       

 <p>
   A title can't <term>itself</term> have a new perspective—it’s only a new perspective to <term2>someone</term2>. This is why we have to tether our humor outcomes to <em>Zoe</em>, not just to the title by itself.

<p>If we only have abstract or technical ways of talking about humor, it can be hard to talk our actual experiences. Humor outcomes give us ways of talking narratively about humor:</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example"> Example #5 (Goats)</button>

<div class="content-example">

<div class="vignette">
        <p>
            <narration>Sam and Jennifer are taking Riley to the kid-friendly farm. A sign at the goat enclosure says</narration> <speech>“GOATS HAVE NO MANNERS.”</speech>

     >

    <p>To be concise, we can pick one or two humor outcomes that elegantly describe a situation. But since humor outcomes overlap and re-describe the same thing, we can use any or all humor outcomes too.</p>

<p>For instance, the sign with the goat doesn’t <term>only</term> <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>—it <term2>also</term2> <humor-outcome>creates rapport</humor-outcome>, makes Sam and Jennifer <humor-outcome>feel accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deals with stress</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>pre-emptively handles complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>opens a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizes goats and attendees</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolizes close ties (to goats and customers)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controls a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoids conflict</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<p>Usually, the more humor outcomes we use to characterize humor, the more some of them will feel non-standard or poetic. While we usually discard these, they're also useful in seeing an emotional situation in new light.</p>
