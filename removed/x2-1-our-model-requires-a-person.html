    <p>While <term>some</term> people in each example felt humor, not <term2>all</term2> of them did.</p> 
           
    <p>Since these outcomes are different for each person, we’ll need to be thoughtful about each perspective.</p>

    <div class="box"> 
          <p><b>The nameless emotion.</b> We don't have a good way to talk about smiling and laughing in a general way. It's the nameless emotion.</p> 
           
           <p>For instance, we don't say someone is <term>sighing and crying</term>&mdash;we say they're <term>sad</term>. The generic word "sad" is useful because people can be sad without sighing and crying.</p> 
           
           <p>But what what do we say when someone is <term2>smiling and laughing</term2>? We <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> really have a <term2>generic word</term2> for this. We usually leave it nameless.</p> 
                 
        <p>In this book, we'll be calling this nameless emotion "humor," which will be useful for a variety of reasons&mdash;including that this nameless emotion involves more than just smiling and laughing, for the same reason sadness involves more than just sighing and crying.</p>
