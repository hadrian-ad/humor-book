    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We find evaluatory information interesting</h1>
    
   
    <p>We <em>prioritize</em> evaluatory information over content information.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
   
    <p class="for-instance">For Instance:</p>
    <p>If someone hands us a sheet of raw data, we check their face first—because evaluatory information has priority over content information in most cases.</p>
    
    <p>Similarly, if someone is shouting, we'll notice this evaluatory information before we notice what they're shouting about.</p>
</div>

<p>If we look into a lecture, we'll almost always first register the mood of the room, and then the contents of the lecture&mdash;if we care about the contents of the lecture at all:</p>



<p>Similarly, we almost <term>always</term> want to know evaluatory information, even as we only <term2>circumstantially</term2> want to know about content information.</p>

<p>If we see a group of tourists sitting, we'll briefly take in their evaluatory information. But we won't really care that we don't know <em>what</em> they're evaluating. That's because we almost <term2>always</term2> care about evaluatory information, but only <term2>circumstantially</term2> care about content information.</p>

    <p>Similarly, if we come across a table of data, we'll probably note the color scheme but not really care much about the content information. That's because we only <em>circumstantially</em> care about content information.</p>

<p>Our emotion networks are so foundational to our lives because we prioritize learning evaluatory information. This means establishing these networks usually precedes any other task.</p>


<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Raw data.</headline> Raw data doesn't communicate evaluatory information. We can't say: <callback>"that table of raw data is feeling upset right now."</callback> The data itself isn't expected or not expecting anything, and the data does not have a sense of consequences—instead, it's <term>people</term> who express evaluatory information at the data.</p> 
    
    <p>Of course, we can <term2>present</term2> data in a way that conveys our reactions—like by using an exclamation mark (!) or <colorred style="color: red">red font</colorred>. But these are actions taken by people in order to entwine evaluatory information to content information.</p> 
    
    <p>Often, the data we find most interesting is already entwined with evaluatory information, which is sometimes conveyed throuch choice of plot, figure captions, color, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>We're also interested in data that we have enough background with to express evaluatory information toward. If we're able to look at a table of data and be amused, relieved, surprised, or so on, we'll find it more interesting than if it's just numbers to us. That's because we usually give evaluatory information priority over content information.</p>
