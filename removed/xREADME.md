<h3>This is a textbook on humor.</h3> 
<p>You'll learn an analytical model of smiles and laughter. The goal of this model is utility in day-to-day applications. These day-to-day applications include making quick decisions in social and creative contexts, and making robust interpretions of situations.</p>
<h4>This textbook is for everyone</h4>
<p>There are no prerequisites to this course. You'll find this course useful if you've never read a formal, indepth analysis of smiles and laughter before.</p>
<h4>Start at the beginning</h4>
<p>This textbook has been constructed to be read in sequence, beginning to end. If you skip chapters, you'll skip critical instruction on the model.</p>
<h3>The textbook is under development</h3>
<p>Additional chapters will be available as they are polished. Website improvements are ongoing.</p>
