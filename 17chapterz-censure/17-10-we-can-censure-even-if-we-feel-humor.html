    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">We can still censure even if we feel humor</h2>
    

<p>We sometimes feel humor at something below dress code. But just because we feel humor doesn't mean we can't <em>also</em> censure that humor attempt:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Jessica and Tom are washing dishes at the dish pit.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*offers sprayer*</action> <speech>“Sprayer?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Tom:</speaker> <internalaction>(mock confused)</internalaction> <speech>“But I hardly know her!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <internalaction>(confused)</internalaction> <speech>“What?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Tom:</speaker> <internalaction>(embarrassed)</internalaction> <speech>“Spray 'er? I hardly know ‘er.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*gets it*</action> <action>*laughs*</action> <internalaction>(vaguely disapproving)</internalaction> <notes>(&larr;Jessica censures Tom even though she laughed)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Tom:</speaker> <action>*apologetically*</action> <speech>“Sorry.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Tom censures himself)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <speech>“No, you’re all good. I laughed.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jessica equates humor with fittedness)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Tom:</speaker> <speech>“No, I should probably keep vaguely misogynistic jokes to a minimum at work.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Tom censures himself again.)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <speech>“Well. Probably!”</speech> </p>
</div>

<p>Above, just because Jessica felt humor doesn’t mean that Tom's humor attempt can’t <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> be unfitted. That’s because we can <term>feel</term> an emotion of humor at the same time our <term2>judgement</term2> can be that the emotion or emotion attempt was unfitted.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This is obvious with other emotions. Just because someone makes us angry doesn't tell us anything about whether their attempt to make us angry was fitted.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We would be perplexed if someone insulted us, made us angry, and then said <callback>"well, since you're angry it must have been okay."</callback> Despite this, we sometimes encounter people who say a joke, make us laugh, and then say <callback>"well since you laughed it must have been okay."</callback></p>

</div>

<p>We can see this split between the <term>feeling</term> and the <term2>judgement</term2> of that feeling all over the place:

    <p><narration>Jasper does a cringey fake accent</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Sam and a stranger in the audience laugh and briefly meet each other’s eyes. They shake their heads a bit.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam and a stranger can feel humor and censure Jasper at the same time)</notes></p>

    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(confused)</internalaction> <speech>“Teeth?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(curiously)</internalaction> *opens her mouth*</p>
    
    <p><narration>Owen and Zoe laugh.</narration></p>

    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Different how?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“They’re teethy! I don’t know!”</speech></p>

    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <internalaction>(regretfully)</internalaction> <speech>“C’mon, we should stay focused.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe can enjoy unfitted humor, while also censuring it)</notes></p>
</div>

 


 <p>We can censure ourselves too:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(sad)</internalaction> <speech>“I dropped my coffee on the way here”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <action>*restrains laughter*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe censures herself to resynchronize with Emma)</notes> <speech>“Sorry. That sucks.”</speech></p>
</div>


<p>When Zoe censures herself, that doesn’t mean she thinks her humor was “bad.”</p> 

<p>Instead, she shows she realizes she may not be maintaining a mutually agreeable standard of efficiency and cohesion&mdash;and works to share Emma's evaluatory perspective more.</p>

    Case study

<div class="content-example">

<p>We can put everything together to look at a case study: a humor attempt where people feel humor was below dress code, even while they feel humor.</p> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Guests are at an upscale gala at the natural history museum. A new exhibit on human bones is opening.</narration></p>
    <p><speaker>MC:</speaker> <speech>"Welcome museum-members. Or as I like to call you: future exhibits!"</speech></p>

<h2>Humor Dress code.</h2> 

<div class="h2">
    <p>The humor dress code is set by the need of cohesion and efficiency. In this scene, the dress code for the MC is relatively high because of how many people he's speaking too.</p>
    
    <p>That's because the need for cohesion is greater when talking to an audience of a hundred people then when talking to just three. There's a similar need for greater efficiency too, since the amount of time wasted by the speaker is multiplied by the amount of people listening. So there's a relatively high dress code.</p>
</div>

<h2>Fittedness.</h2> 
<div class="h2">
    <p>The MC's humor attempt can be described with some humor outcomes: it <humor-outcome>gives a new perspective</humor-outcome>, and in some ways <humor-outcome>creates rapport</humor-outcome>. This generates some humor.</p> 
    
    <p>The humor attempt also generated some mistake-predominant emotions along with humor. Instead of feeling <emotions>comfort</emotions> and <emotions>safety</emotions>, the guests felt a bit of <emotions><outcome-contrast>discomfort</outcome-contrast></emotions> and <emotions><outcome-contrast>worry</outcome-contrast></emotions>; instead of feeling <humor-outcome>close ties were symbolized</humor-outcome>, they <humor-outcome>felt close ties were <outcome-contrast>dismissed</outcome-contrast></humor-outcome>; and so on.</p>
</div> 

<h2>Censure.</h2> 
<div class="h2"><p>The MC's humor attempt didn't quite meet the humor dress code. The entire crowd censures him by being somewhat pointedly desynchronized&mdash;their humor is muted and not expressed at his intensity. They also display mistake-predominant emotions. In this book, this is censure.</p> 
    
    <p>However, since the humor attempt wasn't that far below the dress code, the censure wasn't that strong. The censure wasn't really confrontational&mdash;but instead more communicational. It lets the audience synchronizes with each other while giving the MC has information he needs to adjust his speech going forward.</p> </div>

<h2>Humor and censure.</h2> 
<div class="h2">
    <p>It's not odd that the audience would feel humor and also express censure at the same time. That's because we can feel an emotion while having a simultaneous judgement about how that emotion fits. The MC can't assume that there's no censure just because there's chuckling.</p>
    
    <p>We also shouldn't exaggerate how much humor the audience feels. Just because they chuckle, doesn't mean they only feel humor&mdash;or feel it intensely. We sometimes reduce an emotional situation to something simple ("they laughed") which can remove important information. In this case, the audience felt mistake-predominant emotions as well.</p>
</div>

<h2>Increasing fittedness.</h2> 
<div class="h2"><p>To increase fittedness, the MC would need to make small or large adjustments to try to push the audience to a wider or clearer variety of humor outcomes or humor family words.</p>
    
     <div class="vignette">
        <p>
            <speaker>MC:</speaker> <speech>"Welcome museum-goer. As a future exhibit myself, I'm excited by all the celebration here!"</speech>
        </p>
         <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
         
         <p>
             <speaker>MC:</speaker> <speech>"Welcome museum-goers! I'm in the same boat as you when I say: we're all future exhibits&mdash;so let's give today's exhibits the applause they deserve."</speech>
         </p></div> 
    
    <p>Both the examples above have more fittedness, and so may be above dress code. That's because they're more clearly aiming toward making the audience feel humor family words and humor outcomes than before.</p> </div>

<h2>Spectator entertainment.</h2> 
<div class="h2">
    <p>This clip from spectator entertainment. We've been discussing the museum-goers reaction, not our reaction. The museum-goers are depicted as seeing the humor attempt as below dress code. However, we, the spectators, probably feel the overall humor attempt (this clip) as above our situation's dress code.</p> 
    
    <p>We're not at the gala&mdash;we're watching a show. The <term>characters</term> have a high dress code and so feel concerned, while <term2>we</term2> have a low dress code, which lets us laugh without censure of the show.</p>
    
    <p>And since this is spectator entertainment, this may or may not be accurate to what would happen in a similar situation.</p>
</div>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Rule-breaking.</headline> Unfitted humor attempts can be fun, important, and useful&mdash;when they avoid censure. Sometimes unfitted humor can be useful even <em>when</em> they're censured. For instance, sometimes:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>a shocking joke breaks the ice</li>
        <li>a needling comment leads to a productive conversation</li>
        <li>unexpected swearing brings people together</li>
        <li>A crude comment against authority rallies a crowd against them</li>
        <li>an off-color joke sets off a redeeming riff</li>
        <li>a random joke starts a conversation</li>
        <li>an out-of-the-blue invitation starts a friendship</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>We often observe and admire instances of this that are done well&mdash;and want to learn to do them ourselves. Counterintuitively, we learn to do these things well by first learning the formal rules well. This gives us the emotional sophistication to <sem-weak>productively</sem-weak> bend the rules.</p>
    
<p>In many ways, this is like real dress codes, for clothes. The better we understand the rules, the better we can bend or break those rules in ways others appreciate instead of finding erratic or underwhelming.</p>
