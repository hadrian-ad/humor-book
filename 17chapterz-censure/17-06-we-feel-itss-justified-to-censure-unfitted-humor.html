    <p>The humor dress code tells us when humor is vulnerable to <vocab>justified</vocab> censure.</p>    
         
             <p>When a humor attempt <term>fits</term> a situation, it’s seen as <term>justified</term>—and so is <term>resistant</term> to censure. When the humor attempt is <em> doesn't fit</em> the situation, it’s <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> seen as <em>justified</em>—it's <em>vulnerable</em> to censure.</p>

<p>We have an intuitive sense of this. In the picture below, their humor seems to have a high fittedness <callback>(<emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on on relevant topics)</callback> and a relatively low dress code <callback>(failable moment has safely passed)</callback>:</p>

<p>Since their humor is fitted, we  <outcome-contrast>wouldn't</outcome-contrast> see someone's censure of their humor as justified.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">If someone watched them laugh and became furious and mumbled to themselves in anger&mdash;we'd feel that censure wasn't justified.</p>
</div>

<p>But let's say they're feeling humor seconds before launch because someone walked in with donuts. In this case, we'd see censure of them as <sem>justified</sem>&mdash;the dress code would be so high (need for efficiency and cohesion) that bringing donuts wouldn't exceed it:</p>

            <p>The dress code is the watershed line between resistance and vulnerability to censure.</p>





<!-- <p>When someone feels humor or a humor attempt is <term>below</term> dress code <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> meeting a minimum standard for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, they feel censure of it is <em>justified</em>. If they feel it's <term>above</term> dress code <callback>(meeting a minimum standard for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, they'll feel censure of it is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <em>justified</em>.</p> -->

    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We used extreme examples above <callback>(abandoning attention to mission control)</callback>, but the same dynamic happens all across our lives.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">    
      If we're in a classroom and jump up excitedly as someone brings in donuts, or we're in a conversation and grin and stretch&mdash;we can intuitively imagine how censure of our actions would be seen as justified or not based on the dress code.</p>
      </div>

<!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The point here isn't that it's a always big deal to grin or stretch in a way that others see as unfitted. Instead, the point is to notice that we notice these things. We register when something seems situationally unjustified, and our registering this is itself a light form of censure.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Emotion dress codes.</headline> We have dress codes for <sem>all</sem> our emotions. Anger isn’t <sem-weak>always</sem-weak> tolerated or <sem-weak>always</sem-weak> censured—instead, it depends on whether the anger is fitted or not.</p>
    
    <p>When <sem>anger</sem> is <term>fitted</term>, it’s seen as <term>justified</term>&mdash;and we describe that justified anger as natural or righteous. When anger is instead <em>unfitted</em>, it’s seen as <em>unjustified</em>&mdash;and we describe that unjustified anger as petty, a tantrum, thin-skinned, whining, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>The fittedness of anger depends on how much it fits the situation. It's more fitted to be angry because someone put our children in danger than it is because someone forgot the ketchup.</p> 
    
    <p>We have a similar awareness of situational fittedness for any emotion, including humor or sadness&mdash;including an intuitive understanding of where the line of justification is.</p>
