    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We feel it's justified to censure unfitted humor</h1>
    

    <p>The humor dress code tells us when humor is vulnerable to <vocab>justified</vocab> censure.</p>

<p>We have an intuitive sense of this. In the picture below, their humor seems to have a high fittedness <callback>(<emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on on relevant topics)</callback> and a relatively low dress code <callback>(failable moment has safely passed)</callback>.</p>
    
                <p>Since their humor is fitted, we wouldn't see someone's censure of their humor as justified:</p>

<p>But let's say they're feeling humor seconds before launch because someone walked in with donuts. In this case, we'd see censure of them as justified&mdash;the dress code would be so high (need for efficiency and cohesion) that bringing donuts wouldn't exceed it:</p>

            <p>When a humor attempt <term>fits</term> a situation, it’s seen as <term>justified</term>—and so is <term>resistant</term> to censure. When the humor attempt is <em> doesn't fit</em> the situation, it’s <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> seen as <em>justified</em>—it's <em>vulnerable</em> to censure. 
            
            <p>The dress code is the watershed line between resistance and vulnerability to censure.</p>





<!-- <p>When someone feels humor or a humor attempt is <term>below</term> dress code <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> meeting a minimum standard for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, they feel censure of it is <em>justified</em>. If they feel it's <term>above</term> dress code <callback>(meeting a minimum standard for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, they'll feel censure of it is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <em>justified</em>.</p> -->

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We used extreme examples above <callback>(abandoning attention to mission control versus not)</callback>, but the same dynamic happens all across our lives.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">
     We can imagine our reaction to someone bringing donuts in during a test.
    
      If we're in a classroom and jump up excitedly as someone brings in donuts, or we're in a conversation and grin and stretch&mdash;we can intuitively imagine how censure of our actions would be justified or not based on the dress code.</p>
      </div>


<!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The point here isn't that it's a always big deal to grin or stretch in a way that others see as unfitted. Instead, the point is to notice that we notice these things. We register when something seems situationally unjustified, and our registering this is itself a light form of censure.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Emotion dress codes.</headline> We have dress codes for all our emotions. For instance, just like humor, anger isn’t <sem-weak>always</sem-weak> tolerated or <sem-weak>always</sem-weak> censured—instead, it depends on whether the anger is fitted or not.</p>
    
    <p>When <sem>anger</sem> is <term>fitted</term>, it’s seen as <term>justified</term>&mdash;and we describe that justified anger as natural or righteous. When anger is instead <em>unfitted</em>, it’s seen as <em>unjustified</em>&mdash;and we describe that unjustified anger as petty, a tantrum, thin-skinned, whining, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>The fittedness of anger depends on how much it fits the situation. If we’re angry because someone put our children in danger, it's more fitted than if we’re angry because someone forgot the ketchup.</p> 
    
    <p>We have a similar awareness of situational fittedness for any emotion, including humor or sadness. For any emotion, we have an understanding of where the line of justification is.</p>
