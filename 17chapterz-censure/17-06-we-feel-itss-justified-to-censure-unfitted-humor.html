    <p>The humor dress code tells us when humor is vulnerable to <vocab>justified</vocab> censure.</p>    
         
    <p>When a humor attempt <term>fits</term> a situation, it’s seen as <term>justified</term>—and so is <term>resistant</term> to censure. When the humor attempt is <em> doesn't fit</em> the situation, it’s <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> seen as <em>justified</em>&mdash;and so is <em>vulnerable</em> to censure.</p>

    alt="This dress code figure has fittedness on the y-axis, and the dress code shown by a dashed line. Arrows point above and below, only this time this they say 'censure isn't justified' if it's above dress code, and 'censure is justified if it's below dress code.";

    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: ">
      
<p>We have an intuitive sense of this. In the picture of the staff below, their humor seems to have a high fittedness <callback>(<emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on on relevant topics)</callback> and a relatively low dress code <callback>(failable moment has safely passed)</callback>:</p>

    alt="This image shows the celebrating mission control staff at a NASA facility. Beneath is a fittedness figure, with a dot far above the dress code in the 'censure isn't justified zone,' with annotations suggesting that it wouldn't occur to us to censure their humor.";
    title="Censure figure II";
    style="max-width: 40rem; margin-left: ">
 
<p>Since their humor is fitted, we  <outcome-contrast>wouldn't</outcome-contrast> see someone's censure of their humor as justified.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">If someone watching this scene became infuriated by their laughter, and mumbled to themselves in anger&mdash;we'd feel that they were in the wrong. In other words, we'd feel that their censure wasn't justified.</p>
</div>

<p>But let's say they're feeling humor seconds before launch because someone walked in with donuts. In this case, we'd see censure of their humor as <sem>justified</sem>&mdash;the dress code would be high enough <callback>(need for efficiency and cohesion)</callback> that surprise donuts wouldn't exceed it:</p>

    alt="This image shows the same celebration from the mission control, only a speech bubble says 'Bob brought donuts!' Beneath is a dress code figure, with a dot far beneath the dress code in the censure is justified zone. Annotations suggest that we'd automatically see this as frustrating.";
    title="Censure figure III";
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: ">
            
    <p>The dress code is the watershed line between <term>resistance</term> to censure and <em>vulnerability</em> to censure.</p>





<!-- <p>When someone feels humor or a humor attempt is <term>below</term> dress code <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> meeting a minimum standard for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, they feel censure of it is <em>justified</em>. If they feel it's <term>above</term> dress code <callback>(meeting a minimum standard for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, they'll feel censure of it is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <em>justified</em>.</p> -->

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We used extreme examples above <callback>(abandoning attention to mission control)</callback>, but the same dynamic happens all across our lives.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">    
      If we're in a classroom and jump up excitedly as someone brings in donuts, or we're in a conversation and grin and stretch&mdash;we can intuitively imagine how censure of our actions would be seen as justified or not based on the dress code.</p>
      </div>

<!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The point here isn't that it's a always big deal to grin or stretch in a way that others see as unfitted. Instead, the point is to notice that we notice these things. We register when something seems situationally unjustified, and our registering this is itself a light form of censure.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Emotion dress codes.</headline> Anger isn’t <sem-weak>always</sem-weak> tolerated or <sem-weak>always</sem-weak> censured—instead, it depends on whether the anger is fitted or not. That's because have dress codes for <sem>all</sem> our emotions.</p>
    
    <p>When <sem>anger</sem> is <term>fitted</term>, it’s seen as <term>justified</term>&mdash;and we describe that justified anger as <sem-weak>natural</sem-weak> or <sem-weak>righteous</sem-weak>. When anger is instead <em>unfitted</em>, it’s seen as <em>unjustified</em>&mdash;and we describe that unjustified anger as a <sem-weak>tantrum</sem-weak> or <sem-weak>thin-skinned</sem-weak>.</p>
    
    <p>The fittedness of anger depends on how much it fits the situation. It's more fitted to be angry because someone put our children in danger than it is because someone forgot the ketchup.</p> 
    
    <p>We have a similar awareness of situational fittedness for any emotion&mdash;including an intuitive understanding of where the line of justification is.</p>
