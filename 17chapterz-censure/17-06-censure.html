    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">17. Censure</h1>
    
    <p>Last chapter we talked about <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-00-dress-codes.html">humor dress codes</a>. In this chapter, we'll look at the relation between humor dress codes and <vocab>censure</vocab>.</p>
   
    <p>When we feel humor or a humor attempt is below dress code, we can censure them by not synchronizing with them:</p>

       <p>Above, there was evaluatory disagreement&mdash;which is registered as censure. We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter</p>



<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Inclusive definitions.</headline> We often think of room-stopping conflict and formal statements when we think of censure. But in this book, more often than not, censure is just a half-smile that contrasts with someone's full smile.</p>
        
        <p>We <sem-weak>want</sem-weak> others to be synchronized with us. When we share an evaluatory perspective, we feel grouped. When we're desynchronized, we feel this as tension that weakens our grouping&mdash;we feel it as  censure. </p>
        
        <p>Sometimes censure happens like dynamite&mdash;but most of the censure we receive in our day-to-day lives isn't a big deal to us. It's something done by everyone to everyone, including us and our friends and family, in ways we think of as neither good nor bad, but just how things work.</p>
        
        </div>
    
    
    
    
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We used extreme examples above <callback>(abandoning attention to mission control versus not)</callback>, but the same dynamic happens all across our lives.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">
     We can imagine our reaction to someone bringing donuts in during a test.
    
      If we're in a classroom and jump up excitedly as someone brings in donuts, or we're in a conversation and grin and stretch&mdash;we can intuitively imagine how censure of our actions would be justified or not based on the dress code.</p>
      </div>


    
    
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>encounter awkward pauses around the dinner table</li>
        <li>exchange looks with each other when the teacher makes an uncomfortable joke</li>
        <li>find our social media post quickly censured by dismissive reactions</li>
        <li>find random pointless stories from our spouse fun, but random pointless stories from the guy in the line in front of us annoying</li>
        <li>cringe when watching an uncomfortable scene in a comedy</li>
        <li>make eye contact with others when someone is weird in public</li>
        <li>share looks with passengers when someone is laughing on the bus too loudly</li>
        <li>know who in the group everyone finds irritating</li>
        <li>register who is censuring who in a meeting</li>
           
           <li>
            find our post censured online by immediate consensus</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
        
<p>In all these cases, some people have arrived at an shared understanding of the humor dress code&mdash;which gives them a shared basis to censure people breaking the dress code.</p> 
   
<p>In other words, the humor dress code tells us when humor is and isn't vulnerable to censure. We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter.</p>
     
  
    <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Censure.</headline> “Censure” and “censor” are similar sounding words that mean different things. To <term>censure</term> is to <term>condemn</term>, while to <em>censor</em> is to <em>suppress communication</em>.</p> 
    
    <p><strong>Censure</strong>:</p>
    <ul class="close-list">
       
        <li>if a group of academics publish a letter condemning us, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li> 
        
        <li>If our parents tell us it was inappropriate to make that humor attempt about Grandma, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li> 
        <li>If people on social media react poorly to the joke we posted, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li> 
        
        <li>If our friend vaguely smiles at our joke in a way we feel is unenthusiastic, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li> 
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>Censor</strong>: 
                </p>    
                
<ul class="close-list">
    <li>if a government commands an organization remove something we wrote, we have been <strong>censored</strong>. </li>
    
    <li>If a militia threatens us with violence if we continue airing a show, we have been <strong>censored</strong>.</li> 
    
    <li>If a forum blots out swear words, the forum has <strong>censored</strong> those words.</li> 
    
    <li>If the sound engineers cut our mic halfway through our speech, we have been <strong>censored</strong>.</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p>While censure and censor are overlapping concepts, generally, <term>censure</term> comes from <term>within</term> emotion networks, in the form of desynchronization—while <em>censorship</em> comes from <em>outside</em> an emotion network, as something imposed on it.</p>
