    <p>Last chapter we talked about <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-00-dress-codes.html">humor dress codes</a>. In this chapter, we'll look at the relation between humor dress codes and <vocab>censure</vocab>.</p>
   
    <p>When we feel humor or a humor attempt is below dress code, we can censure them by not synchronizing with them:</p>

       <p>Above, there was evaluatory disagreement&mdash;which is registered as censure.</p>
       
<div class="consider">
           <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            <p class="considertext">When we share an evaluatory perspective <callback>(synchronized)</callback>, we feel grouped. When we don't, we feel tension weakening our grouping&mdash;which is why we feel desynchronization as censure.</p>
            
            <p class="considertext">This is why if we enthusiastically suggest something, and people aren't as excited, we'll feel we've been censured. We experience desynchronization as censure.</p>

       <p>We'll be talking about this throughout this chapter</p>



<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Inclusive definitions.</headline> When we think of censure, we often think of room-stopping conflict and formal statements. And <term>sometimes</term> censure happens like dynamite&mdash;but <em>most</em> of the time, censure isn't a big deal to anyone.
       
     <p>In this book censure is more often than not just a half-smile that contrasts with someone's full smile. It's something everyone does to everyone, including among us and our friends and family, in ways we think of as neither good nor bad, but just how things work.</p>
