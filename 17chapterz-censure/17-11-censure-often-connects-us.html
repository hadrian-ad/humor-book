    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">Censure connects us more often than divides us</h2>
    
<p>We often think of censure as something that <term>divides</term> people. But censure usually <term2>connects</term2> us instead:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Jasper makes a joke with a tasteless fake accent, and it’s cringey. Sam meets a stranger’s eye.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam and a stranger connect with each other by censuring Jasper)</notes></p>
</div>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Justin and Heather are cleaning up after a dinner party.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*amused*</action> <speech>“How about Travis just barging into every conversation?!”</speech></p>

    <p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(mimicking)</internalaction> <speech>“Fantastic. Fantastic!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>They continue bonding as they clean.</narration></p>
</div>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam and the rest of the administrators have to watch a new training video. It’s full of tedious puns. It’s both infantilizing and a waste of time.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>People adjust themselves in their seats, check their phones, and sigh. Everyone is aware of how much they are all hating this.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam and the rest of staff connect with each other by censuring video)</notes></p>
</div>


<p>In the examples above, the censure is something people are doing <term>with</term> each other, not <term2>against</term2> each other:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>
        <p>When Sam and a stranger exchange looks at Jasper’s fake accent, they’re checking to confirm that they have synchronized evaluations&mdash;which tightens them as a subnetwork. Whether Jasper notices this censure is neither here nor there.</p>
    </li>
    
             <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-11-censure-often-connects-us/17-11-0-censure-as-connection.png
    
        alt="This surface tension figure shows Jasper and two audience members sharing equal surface tension. An arrow shows a later moment, where Sam and a stranger connect with each other in censure of Jasper. This tightens their surface tension, tightening their group relative to their group with Jasper.";
        title="Surface tension figure I";
        style="max-width: 30rem; margin-left: ">
    
    <li>
        <p>Justin and Heather are synchronizing in a way tightens their emotion network&mdash;but they intentionally waited until Travis is gone to do this. Their censure is something they do with each other, not something they do against someone.</p>
        
                 <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-11-censure-often-connects-us/17-11-1-justin-heather-bring-closer.png
        
            alt="This surface tension figure shows two people with low surface tension, and an arrow showing a later moment where they have high surface tension. An annotation says 'Justin and Heather use censure as a humor attempt to bring them closer.'";
            title="Surface tension figure II";
            style="max-width:22rem ; margin-left: ">
        
        <p>Heather and Justin are processing mistakes together. They’re shifting mistakes and OKs into balance and <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>sharing personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizing</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
        <p>The school administrators are watching a video, which means they <em>can’t</em> censure the people who made the training video&mdash;there’s no one there to censure! Their censure is something they do together. They want to make sure everyone shares their grievances about the video.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Most censure is connective like this&mdash;it synchronizes groups more tightly. Censure is <term>usually</term> used to calibrate groups or connect people <term>together</term>&mdash;and is only <term2>rarely</term2> used confrontationally to <term2>divide</term2> or fragment groups.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>Censure redefines groups, often subtly, like over the course of a dinner. Nothing really happens, other than a shift in some of the group dynamics.</p> 
   
<p>Sometimes this happens more aggressively, where enough connective censure builds up that we’re able to exclude or expel the target or source of our censure.</p>
 
   <p>But even though this expulsion is <sem-weak>sometimes</sem-weak> an outcome of this process, it’s not the most common outcome or even the main general goal of this process.</p>

 </div>

<p>Humor dress codes and censure are how we communicate, group, and organize. In our day-to-day lives, humor dress codes allow feedback in ways that allows social groups to function well together.</p>

<div class="content-example">
    
<p>We sometimes think that we should <em>rationalize</em> humor or humor dress codes&mdash;perhaps through lists of permitted and forbidden content. But this misunderstands humor and emotions more generally.</p>

  <p>We know we can’t verbally promise ourselves that we won’t be angry or sad next week&mdash;or sign a binding contract that we’ll only feel happiness next week. These promises or contracts wouldn’t do anything!</p> 

<p>For the same reason we can't sign a contract like this with <term>ourselves</term>, we can't force <term2>others</term2> to sign a contract. We can’t control emotion dress codes in this way!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>This doesn’t stop people from trying. For instance, during the French revolution, the constitutional assembly formally banned laughter at their meetings.</p> 
       
    <p>But laughter continued, and there really wasn’t anything formal rules could do about it. They could <term>enforce</term> the rule, but not reach inside and <term2>change</term2> people's underlying evaluatory system.
    </p>
    
    <p>Charitably, their goal was to become more effective, deliberative, grave, rational, and so on&mdash;but interestingly, an unfollowable rule brought them further away from all of those thing!</p> 

</div>

<p>Even though we can't control emotional dress codes by dictate, people still try all the time:</p>



<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Stephen calls an all-staff meeting.</narration>
    </p>
    
    <p><speaker>Stephen:</speaker> <speech>“There will be no laughing during all-hands meeting. None. Got it? We’re going to spend the rest of the hour figuring out what’s happening in research. We don’t have time for nonsense.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Stephen tries to set a dress code in advance)</notes></p>
</div>



<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Tucker calls an all-staff meeting.</narration>
    </p>
    
    <p><speaker>Tucker:</speaker> <speech>“Now I want us to have fun. We have to laugh. No frown-y faces. C’mon everyone. Let’s laugh. Ha ha ha! Amber, why don’t you start us off with a joke? Anything goes!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Tucker tries to set a dress code in advance)</notes></p>
</div>


<p>Stephen is trying to set the dress code so high that any humor would be seen as unfitted <callback>(and so seen as justifiably censurable)</callback>&mdash;Tucker wants to set it so low that any humor or humor attempt would be fitted <callback>(and so <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast>  justifiably censurable)</callback>.</p> 

<p>The problem is that dress codes aren’t something Stephen or Tucker have centralized control over.</p>

<div class="consider">
<consider>Consider:</consider>

<p>This is obvious with something like anger. We can't just wave our hands to set what things people around us see as justifiably infuriating.</p> 
   
<p>We can't control the <term>anger</term> dress code for the same reason we can't control the <term2>humor</term2> dress code.</p>
    </div>

<p>When we think we should be able to set dress codes unilaterally, we don't just treat others as inferiors&mdash;we won’t succeed either!</p>

<p>If we want to raise a dress code, everyone around us will need to have a non-theoretical reason for increased efficiency and cohesion.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>It’s not enough for <term>Stephen</term> to feel a need for efficiency and cohesion&mdash;since the dress code is set by <term>everyone</term>. In a room of twenty people, Stephen is only 1/20th of the opinion on this.</p>

    <p>The dress code won't raise until <term2>everyone</term2> present <term2>also</term2> agrees on the need for increased efficiency and cohesion.</p>
    </div>

<p>At best, Stephen could try to <term>censor</term>&mdash;rather than <term2>censure</term2>&mdash;humor. He could try to force people to behave <em>as if</em> the dress code was a certain way. But this is a bit like making people enjoy his birthday party at gunpoint&mdash;the picture of what he wants only.</p>

<p>If the staff is intimidated, they may <term>censor</term> (not <term2>censure</term2>) themselves the way Stephen wants&mdash;but this is different than him actually setting the dress code for them. Stephen would just be compelling behavior, not changing what others internally recognize as fitted or unfitted.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>Teachers often do this with students. When students don't feel any need for efficiency or cohesion, they lower their dress code and goof off without censuring each other.</p> 
    
    <p>Instead of <term>addressing</term> the cause of their lower dress code <callback>(boredom, lack of perceived need for efficiency or cohesion)</callback>, the teacher tries to <term2>force</term2> them to not goof off <callback>(censor)</callback>. The teacher is trying to enforce a dictated dress code in a way that goes against how dress codes are actually set.</p>
    
    
        <p>Sometimes teachers think classes need to get serious <callback>(raise a dress code)</callback> before they get started&mdash;but this is often backwards. We actually need to get started before we get serious!</p> 
        
        <p>That's because moving into an activity that requires greater cohesion and efficiency will <term>naturally</term> raise the dress code&mdash;while simply yelling at people to knock it off tries to ineffectively <term2>force</term2> a dress code through censoring.</p>
</div>
    
    
    <p>Sometimes, we have the incomplete perspective that humor is counterproductive. The problem with this is that <term>fitted</term> humor is by <term2>definition</term2> productive&mdash;it’s doing many things at once, in a way that meets the current minimum standard.</p>


<p>If we can't distinguish between fitted and unfitted humor, and so tried to censure <em>all</em> humor, we'd be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Removing all humor would be a solution that creates problems.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>Sometimes we think we can get rid of dress codes, like if we go to an anything goes basement comedy club show, an unmoderation forum, or so on. But that’s an illusion: any group of people will always form dress codes.</p> 
    
    <p>This is why an audience that's hungry for taboo jokes will still censure annoying laughter or comments from within the audience, or why members of a boundary-pushing forum will still censure people making fun of members a certain way.</p> 
    
    <p> That's because humor dress codes haven't gone away, and those audiences haven't been exempted from the normal process that sets them.</p> 
    
    <p>The same thing is true for people who try to <sem-weak>raise</sem-weak> a dress code instead of lowering them. Simply saying a topic is off-limits doesn't stop us from finding fitted humor attempts on that topic fitted.</p>
</div>

<p>When we understand how dress codes work, we can better influence them or make sense of why people are behaving the way they are.

      <p>When we see people having fun when we think they should be serious, or being serious where we think they should be having fun, we don't <em>only</em> need to be frustrated&mdash;since their dress code gives us insight into how they’re seeing the world around them.</p>

<p>This in turn lets us make changes to our approach to people in ways that accords with how people work. We can recognize this being done by the genuine emotional leaders we know in our lives. Instead of being in conflict with how we work, they lead by being in harmony with it.</p>

    <li>The dress code is the line where two competing measures meet: the justification for censure, and the justification for humor or the humor attempt. The dress code is the line where one justification becomes larger than the other.</li>
