    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We tolerate what seems justified</h1>
    
<p>We can’t effectively censure something when everyone feels it's well-fitted. Since everyone sees the humor attempt as justified, they'll find our censure unjustified.</p>
   
    
    <p>We sometimes feel this with fables, proverbs, satire, and so on which are seen as above any justified reproach:</p>

        <narration>At a department meeting, they discuss using  Travis to fill the position instead of searching for someone new. </narration>

        alt="This dress cofe figure shows a high dress code and a very high fittedness to the satire. An integration figure shows all the inputs to this high fittedness, including the topic of a relevant news story, the humor family words connection and release, and the humor outcomes of delas with taboo topics, acceptably criticizes, opens new topic of conversation, helps achieve catharsis, supports an argument, and gives new perspective.";
    title="High fittedness of satire";
    style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: ">
    
    
    <p>Above, Zoe, Owen, and Emma implicitly agree that the justification for <term>tolerating</term> the humor attempt is greater than the justification for <em>censuring</em> it. When enough people feel this way, the satire itself won't be condemned.</p>
           
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
   <p class="considertext">No one felt much humor in any of the examples above, and Jessica actually got angry&mdash;but humor <sem>attempts</sem> can be fitted whether or not anyone actually feels humor.</p>
    </div>  

      
      
      
<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Protection.</headline> When satire is tolerated because of fittedness, it's tolerated because of fittedness&mdash;not because it's satire. Similarly, someone censures an unfitted proverb, it's not because it's a proverb&mdash;it's because it's unfitted.</p>  
        
    <p>
        We often see something similar when people try to delegitimize censure by saying <callback>"It was just a joke!"</callback> The issue wasn't confusion over whether it was a joke, which is neither here nor there&mdash;the issue was that everyone saw the humor attempt as unfitted.
