    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We tolerate what seems justified</h1>
    
<p>When something is well-fitted, we can’t effectively censure it. Since everyone sees the humor attempt as justified, they'll find our censure unpersuasive:</p>
   
    
    <p>We sometimes feel this with fables, proverbs, satire, and so on which are seen as above justified reproach:</p>

    <p>Above, Zoe, Owen, and Emma implicitly agree that the justification for <term>tolerating</term> the humor attempt is greater than the justification for <em>censuring</em> it. When enough people feel this way, the satire itself won't be condemned.</p>
           
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
   <p class="considertext">No one felt much humor in any of the examples above&mdash;but humor <sem>attempts</sem> can be fitted whether or not anyone actually feels humor.</p>

<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Protection.</headline> When satire is tolerated because of fittedness, it's because of fittedness&mdash;not because it's satire. Similarly, if the English department censures an unfitted proverb, it's not because it's a proverb but because it's unfitted.</p>  
        
          <p>It's not genres that get a special blank check&mdash;it's just that those genres are often fitted and above the humor dress code. It's fittedness that determines whether any emotional attempt is justified and tolerated. </p>
