What do people feel when not feeling humor?
</h1>
 
 <!-- 04.30 -->
 
 
<p>
	When the size of mistakes and OKs are close to balanced, we feel humor. When they're <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> balanced, we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> feel humor.
	</p>
	
<p>
	But there are two ways these scales can not be balanced. The scales can either be <vocab>mistake-predominant</vocab> <callback>(mistake is larger than the OK)</callback> or <vocab>OK-predominant</vocab> <callback>(OK is larger than the mistake)</callback>:

    title="Demonstrating mistake-predominance and OK-predominance"
    alt="This image puts all our various graphs together. At the top is our flowchart, with a mistake box at the top flowing into OK boxes that are either smaller, the same, or larger. Each outcome is re-represented as the balance of scales, where the scales are either tipping toward the larger mistake, balancing, or tipping toward the larger OK. Each state is then re-represented below on our evaluation graph. When the line for mistake is above the line for OK, we're 'mistake-predominant'. When the lines are closed, we're 'balanced' and feel humor. When the line for OK is above the line for mistake we're 'OK-predominant."

<p>
	Above, someone starts with mistake-predominant evaluations, moves into humor, and then moves into OK-predominant evaluations. 
</p>
<p>
	This lets us describe different parts of the emotional situation over time—not just when there <term>is</term> humor, but also when there's <em>not</em> humor:

    title="Our evaluation graphs let us see what people are feeling when they are not feeling humor"
    alt="This evaluation graph has a grey bar around the line for OK, showing that there's a blurred division of humor between mistake-predominant and OK-predominant. When the line for mistake is in this bar, someone is feeling at least some humor. When the line for mistake is above or below this bar, they're mistake-predominant or OK-predominant."

<p><headline>Informal precision.</headline> We'll be using these <vocab>evaluation graphs</vocab> throughout the rest of this book—but informally, without pretending they offer more precision than they do. Like any sketch, they're just quickly trying to convey the gist of something. </p>	

<p>We've thought about mistakes and OKs with numbers. The goal of the numbers wasn't to imply precision, but to show that these evaluations are fluid. Once we accomplish that goal and see evaluations as fluid and changing, the numbers aren't so important.</p>
   
<p>That's why in the rest of the book we won't use numbers for mistakes and OKs. Our evaluations will be informally described as "small," "medium," or "large," and our graphs will be informal and sketch-like.</p></div>
