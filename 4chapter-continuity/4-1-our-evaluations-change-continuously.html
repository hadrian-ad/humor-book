Evaluations change continuously 
</h1>

<p>
	We can see evaluations change over a few <term>seconds</term>, like when Owen tells Emma a joke. But we can also look at evaluations changing over a period of <em>months</em> or <em>years</em>: 
</p>

<div class="vignette">
       <p>
        <narration>Middle school Zoe has a huge crush on Ryan from the boy’s track team. She keeps trying to start a text conversation with him, until he finally gets annoyed.</narration> <speech>“Stop texting me,”</speech> <narration>he writes her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels this is an enormous mistake)</notes></p> 
        
        <p><narration>Zoe’s grin fades and she puts down her phone and curls over her legs from shame.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels this is a tiny OK)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
    <p>
	We can arbitrarily assign numbers to Zoe’s mistakes and OKs to think about how Zoe’s evaluations change over time:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
       <p><strong>A.</strong> <narration>Middle school Zoe is devastated by the rejection.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels this is a mistake of 10 with an OK of 1)</notes></p>
        <p><strong>B.</strong> <narration>Two months later, Zoe still wants her parents to move to another country.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 10, OK 2)</notes></p>
        <p><strong>C.</strong> <narration>Two month later, Zoe still wants to transfer schools.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 10, OK 3)</notes>
        </p>
        <p><strong>D.</strong> <narration>Two months later, Zoe still wants to drop out of track.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 10, OK 4)</notes></p>
        <p><strong>E. </strong><narration>Two months later, Zoe still wonders how she could have been so stupid.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 9, OK 5)</notes></p>
        <p><strong>F. </strong> <narration>Two months later, the text conversation crosses Zoe’s mind. It wasn’t such a big deal after all, was it? She gives a loud laugh, suddenly feeling cleansed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 5, OK 5&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>
      
        </div>
<p>
	At this point, the humor peaks, since the size of the mistakes and OKs match. But we don't have to stop at the peak of intensity—we can keep thinking about Zoe’s evaluations for as long as we think would be useful:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <strong>G.</strong> <narration>Two months later, if Zoe thinks of it, she smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 4, OK 6)</notes></p>
        <p><strong>H.</strong> <narration>Two months later, if for some reason it crosses her mind, it amuses her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake 4, OK 7)</notes></p>
        <p><strong>I.</strong> <narration>Two months later, Zoe is reading an article online about making sense of bad feelings, and she makes another realization. </narration><notes>(&larr; mistake 2, OK 10)</notes></p>
        <p><narration>Zoe smiles at the realization—but the event itself is now outside the bounds of humor and completely in the past. If she thinks of it again, she feels something other than humor.</narration></p>

    title="More practice with our graphs"
    alt="This image has three graphs stacked on top of each other, tracking Zoe's evaluations over time. The three graphs disambiguate the plotted components (OK, mistake, and intensity of humor) to help the reader practice reading these evaluation graphs. They show the intensity of humor peaking where Zoe's mistake and OK is in balance at moment F."
    style="max-width: 37rem;">

<p>
	If we <term>only</term> track the <em>intensity</em> of humor, the humor can seem to come from nowhere and then vanish. But when we instead focus on mistakes and OKs, we can see humor as emerging and disappearing predictably from two continuous and interacting measures.
