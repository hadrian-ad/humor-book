 Emotions fall within these three zones 
</h1>
 
 <!-- 04.50 -->
  
<p>
	Throughout this book, we’ll talk about emotions as being somewhere in relation to these three zones:
</p>
<div class="list-in-text">
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            Mistake-predominant emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>afraid</emotions>, <emotions>ashamed</emotions>, <emotions>bummed</emotions>, <emotions>confused</emotions>, <emotions>excited</emotions>, <emotions>irritated</emotions>, <emotions>focused</emotions>, <emotions>grieving</emotions>, <emotions>jealous</emotions>, <emotions>perplexed</emotions>, <emotions>sad</emotions>, <emotions>stressed</emotions>, <emotions>terror</emotions>, <emotions>worried</emotions>,
      
      <i>and so on</i>)</callback></p>
    
                <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            Balanced emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>humor</emotions>)</callback></p>
        
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            OK-predominant emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>apathetic</emotions>, <emotions>bored</emotions>, <emotions>calm</emotions>, <emotions>certain</emotions>, <emotions>content</emotions>, <emotions>convinced</emotions>, <emotions>detached</emotions>, <emotions>leisurely</emotions>, <emotions>listless</emotions>, <emotions>neutral</emotions>, <emotions>relaxed</emotions>, <emotions>stagnant</emotions>, <emotions>satisfied</emotions>, <emotions>tranquil</emotions>, <emotions>unexcited</emotions>, <i>and so on</i>)</callback> </p>
    </div>
<p>
	This helps us see humor as part of the same emotional landscape as other emotions. Humor isn’t <term>apart</term> from other emotions—instead, it has a specific place: humor is sandwiched <em>between</em> emotions like anger and calm.
</p>
<p>
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance"> For instance:</p>
	    <p class="for-instance-text">
	    It can seem odd that we sometimes laugh before moments of apathy and also sometimes laugh before moments of terror. But it’s not odd when we think of humor as equally adjacent to both apathy and terror. 
	    </p>
	    </div>
	    
	    <p>
	When we cross between these two emotional zones, humor “rings”—like how a convenience store bell rings whenever the door is opened, whether someone is going in or out. 
</p>
<p>
	In this way, humor rings on the way to terror, the same way humor rings on our way to apathy:

    alt="This evaluation graph shows the mistake going from far below the OK (apathy) to far above the OK (terror) and back again, pointing out how humor marks these transitions."
    style="max-width: 31rem;">

<p>
	If we’re in a convenience store, we can ring the bell by opening the door—but then not go through the door. We can do the same with humor, where humor rings, but we don’t change which zone we’re in:

    alt="This evaluation graph shows a mistake dipping toward an OK, producing humor without crossing the OK."
    style="max-width: 24rem;">
<p>
	We can also open and close the convenience store door repeatedly to keep dinging the bell. We can do something similar for humor too: 
</p>

    title="Humor rings repeatedly by quickly transitioning zones"
    alt="This evaluation graph shows a mistake entwined around an OK."
    style="max-width: 22rem;">

<p>
	We’ll be using this way of thinking about our emotions <callback>(three emotional zones)</callback> throughout this book—which will let us keep our thinking organized when interpreting humor.

<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Scope.</headline> In this book, we'll be treating anger and sadness as similar enough to be treated as the same&mdash;we'll just call them <callback>"mistake-predominant emotions."</callback></p> 
   
 <p>We do this all the time, like how we can talk about "trees" in general sometimes. Even though we can distinquish them further. Sometimes, it's enough to simply talk about trees.</p>  
   
 <p>As we'll see, taking this approach will be an orderly place to start 
 
 
 We can also take the other approach, where we pull back and things coalesce together. This book primarily focuses on this drawn-back view, as it's often an orderly place to start when thinking about how humor fits into emotions.</p> 
 
 <p>At the same time, that's not to say it's the only or even the best way to think about emotions. Instead, it's designed to support and complement other ways we think about emotions. </p>

    A deeper look (Emotions)

<div class="content-example">
       
<p>Since we grew up with words like "humor" and "emotions," we often find it hard to imagine a world without them&mdash;a bit like how it would be hard to imagine a world without words like "tree" or "cloud."</p>

<p>But surprisingly, <sem>both</sem> <term>humor</term> and <em>emotions</em> are relatively new words, whose modern meanings didn't actually exist for most of history.</p>

<p>Let's go over a quick history of both of these words:</p>


<h2>Humor</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <p>"Humor" originally meant "juice of a plant or animal." So we can squeeze the humors from apples <callback>(apple juice)</callback>, and squirrels are full of squirrel humors. Words like <sem-weak>humor, humid, humidify, humidor, humus,</sem-weak> and so on all share the same root of <sem-weak>"moist, wet."</sem-weak></p>
    
    <p>Humor didn't have any association with laughter at all&mdash;and didn't have any association with emotions in general&mdash;until just a few hundred years ago. That's when dimensions in a popular personality modeling system were labeled with human humors <callback>(human "juices")</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p>Eventually, the combininations of fluids <callback>(humors specifically)</callback> was seen as an extraneous step, and "humor" started to directly mean something like "malleable medium of disposition" <callback>(humor generally)</callback>, often with a capricious subtext. <callback>(“The baby was in bad humor yesterday, but is in good humor today!”). </callback></p>
    
    <p>Over the next two hundred years or so, the meaning of humor shifted from "the malleable medium of disposition" into all the things it also means today&mdash;which is a very broad tent that coexist with these older meanings.</p>
    
    <p>The modern meanings tends to related from different angles to laughter&mdash;including humor's overlapping meanings like <callback>"laughter,"</callback> <callback>"cause of laughter,"</callback> <callback>"jokes in general,"</callback> <callback>"interpersonal ability to generate laughter,"</callback> <callback>"laughter associated with weirdness,"</callback> <callback>"a feeling associated with laughter,"</callback> and so on.</p> 
    
    
        </div>


<h2>Emotion</h2> 
<div class="h2">
    <p>The word “emotion” was originally just a variation of the word “motion.” Like <term>e-rupt</term> and <term>rupt(ure)</term>, <em>e-motion</em> was just <em>motion</em> with an emphatic or expelling <sem-weak>e-</sem-weak> in front. 
    
    <p>This is why early uses of emotion were about <sem>motion</sem>:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>an earthquake was emotion in the ground <callback>(the ground shakes, has motion)</callback></li>
        <li>a crowd had emotion as they filed out of the stadium <callback>(they moved together, com-motion)</callback></li>
        <li>a letter could cause a reader’s emotion <callback>(like pacing, from internal feelings)</callback></li></ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>From there, the word eventually developed into its current sense—<callback>“cogitated feelings, especially strong ones (that cause movement).”</callback></p> 
    
    <p>Sometimes, we use the word “emotion” expansively and beyond movement&mdash;we use emotion to refer to all inner life. But the meaning of “emotion” constantly drifts back to motion.</p>
           
  <p>If a director says <callback>“let’s do the scene again, this time with more EMOTION!”</callback>—they don’t mean more vivid internal sensations. The director mean more <sem-weak>emoting</sem-weak>, more expressive action in the body and face. </p>
       
<p>Similarly, we call cats emotionless&mdash;not because cats don't have feelings, moods, opinions, personality, preferences, reactions, and so on, because they obviously do&mdash;but because their faces don’t move. Cats can’t emote in the same way dogs can, with their moving <callback>(emotional)</callback> faces. </p>
    
<div class="consider">
       
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
        <p class="considertext">It's the same for people. When a novelist describes someone as "emotionless" they often mean they have a stony poker face <callback>("motionless")</callback>&mdash; not that there's nothing happening inside them.</p>
        
        <!--
        <p class="considertext">Similarly, we think of stormy seas and blowing trees as emotional, where it's the motion that gives power to the analogy to human emotion.  </p>
-->
    </div>
  
     <!--   
     <p>This association with movement is one reason emotion sometimes struggles to encompass everything we want it to&mdash;including things like intentions due to mood or tone of reflections. </p>
     -->
    </div> 

<p>"Humor" and "emotion" took on new meanings together because of metaphor that became more and more embedded, which caught several words in its wake, giving them new meanings&mdash;the metaphor that <term>experiences</term> were <em>liquid</em>.</p>

<p>Since <term>humors</term> <callback>(liquids)</callback> were particularly <em>emotional</em> <callback>(fluid)</callback>, they both suited these metaphorical descriptions of internal human feelings. Our evaluatory nature infused us like sap or blood&mdash;mixed and behaved like liquids in a container&mdash;and could be expelled or drained in some way.</p>
<p>


<p>This popular metaphor is why these two words, humor and emotion, changed together from literally describing <term>fluids</term> and <term>movement</term> to metaphorically describing <em>cause of laughter</em> and <em>feelings</em>.</p>  

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We have plenty of remenants of this metaphor cluster, like when we talk about emotions as something we are <sem-weak>"filled with"</sem-weak> that can be <sem-weak>"let out"</sem-weak> or <sem-weak>"expelled."</sem-weak></p>
    
    <p class="considertext">These metaphors replaced the Latin word for emotion <callback>(affect)</callback>, which meant <sem-weak>"to have done to,"</sem-weak> <sem-weak>"to have been connected in such a way."</sem-weak></p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">The replacement of <term>affect</term> <callback>(done to us)</callback> with <em>emotions/humor</em> <callback>(happens within us)</callback> also upturned and outdated many traditional words, like merry <callback>(something that causes enjoyement, "merry weather")</callback>.</p>
    </div>



<p>One of the points of all this is to give some distance from the modern sense of these words&mdash;which are often confusing! Despite this, they still dominate how we think about ourselves.</p> 

<p>But when we know we can step back and see their metaphors&mdash;and a bit strange, nebulous, and inconsistent&mdash;we have more freedom to treat these words as one tool in a bigger toolbox in think about ourselves.
</p>


<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Slang.</headline> The modern meaning of "humor" is kind of slangy. We can feel this slanginess by imagining that we're saying "juice” instead of humor:</p> 
        
        <ul class="close-list">
         <li>“he just has a great sense of juice about him”</li>
         <li>“that movie has great juice”</li> 
         <li>"it's juice that makes life worth living!"</li>
        <li>“just juice him, it's not worth the conflict”</li> 
        </ul>
        
    <p>One way of thinking about "slang" is that the meaning doesn't match its etymology. This gives some context to a new word like humor <callback>("moistness")</callback>, which often feels categorically different to more durable emotional words.</p>    
    
    <p>The etymology of words like <sem-weak>anger, anxiety, angina,</sem-weak> and so on come from the root for <sem-weak>"painful, painfully constricted"</sem-weak>&mdash;of <sem-weak>grief, grave, aggravate,</sem-weak> and so on the root of <sem-weak>"heavy"</sem-weak>&mdash;of love from the root for <sem-weak>care, love</sem-weak></p>
         
         <p>These words have been stable for thousands of years, which helps us think about why a word like humor can seem to exist in a different neighborhood from them.</p>

<!--
<p>A note from the author&mdash;while I did almost no conventional research on humor at all for this book, of indispensable help was the <callback>(the stupendously weird and monumental)</callback> <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>. As a high schooler, this book introduced me to the ideas of mistakes and OKs, which let me spend about fifteen years observing humor through that lens&mdash;and directly led to this book being the way it was.</p>
 
<p><book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> (2004-ish) was written by Warren Shibles&mdash;the clanless and deeply unloved arch-academic. His lunar clarity of thinking and writing profoundly influenced me&mdash;not just his book about humor, but also his books on death, emotions, ethics, humor, lies, love, time, and so on. His refusal to mystify his writing directly influenced the style of this book.</p> 

<p>Never popular or famous&mdash;hated by his colleagues—autistic during a time that gave them little quarter&mdash;his main surviving writings are (unfortunately) articles against second-wave feminism. <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> itself was a pioneering work of Internet self-publishing and continual development&mdash;but now only exists on Internet archival sites.</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p><speaker>Obituary:</speaker> Following Warren's wishes no formal services were held. <i>"What begins as a study of death ends up, to some extent, as a study of life and love."</i></p>
</div>


<p>This book is indebted to Warren Shibles, who wrote <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> (2004)&mdash;which is easily one of the strangest books ever written. Lost to time, it exists only on Internet archival services.</p>

<p>Shibles was an enthusiastic pioneer of online publishing, and wrote books with lucid strangeness on death, love, time, lies, humanism, emotions, ethics, linquistics, philosophy, and humor. He had a kind of lunar clarity to his thinking that made mixed impressions on different readers.</p>
  
<p>He was an autistic professor at a time when the world wasn't particularly kind to them&mdash;and Shibles bickered constantly with his department. He was looked down on by his colleages for never completing his PhD course. He loved writing children's philosophy books that no child could ever love&mdash;like <book-title>Time: A Critical Analysis for Children</book-title>.</p>

<p>Without influence in his lifetime, he's almost completely forgotten&mdash;with one of the few exceptions being the author of this book. I read <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> as a high schooler, and it  made me a sleeper agent for humor ethnography&mdash;and sent me through university being puzzled that thoughts about humor were often so disorganized.</p>

<p>Shibles' allowed me to spend more than a decade thinking independently about humor, developing an expanded and readable presentation of Shibles' thoughts on humor, with a certain degree of normalcy added in.</p>

<p>It also helps characterize this book's study of <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>&mdash;a description of laughing and smiling over time that involves thinking fluidly about evaluations over time.
