 Emotions are in these three zones 
</h1>
 
 <!-- 04.50 -->
  
<p>
	Throughout this book, we’ll talk about emotions as being somewhere in relation to these three zones:
</p>
<div class="list-in-text">
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            Mistake-predominant emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>afraid</emotions>, <emotions>ashamed</emotions>, <emotions>bummed</emotions>, <emotions>confused</emotions>, <emotions>excited</emotions>, <emotions>irritated</emotions>, <emotions>focused</emotions>, <emotions>grieving</emotions>, <emotions>jealous</emotions>, <emotions>perplexed</emotions>, <emotions>sad</emotions>, <emotions>stressed</emotions>, <emotions>terror</emotions>, <emotions>worried</emotions>,
      
      <i>and so on</i>)</callback></p>
    
                <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            Balanced emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>humor</emotions>)</callback></p>
        
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            OK-predominant emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>apathetic</emotions>, <emotions>bored</emotions>, <emotions>calm</emotions>, <emotions>certain</emotions>, <emotions>content</emotions>, <emotions>convinced</emotions>, <emotions>detached</emotions>, <emotions>leisurely</emotions>, <emotions>listless</emotions>, <emotions>neutral</emotions>, <emotions>relaxed</emotions>, <emotions>stagnant</emotions>, <emotions>satisfied</emotions>, <emotions>tranquil</emotions>, <emotions>unexcited</emotions>, <i>and so on</i>)</callback> </p>
    </div>
<p>
	This helps us see humor as part of the same emotional landscape as other emotions. Humor isn’t <term>apart</term> from other emotions—instead, it has a specific place: humor is sandwiched <em>between</em> emotions like anger and calm.
</p>
<p>
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance"> For instance:</p>
	    <p class="for-instance-text">
	    It can seem odd that we sometimes laugh before moments of apathy and also sometimes laugh before moments of terror. But it’s not odd when we think of humor as equally adjacent to both apathy and terror. 
	    </p>
	    </div>
	    
	    <p>
	When we cross between these two emotional zones, humor “rings”—like how a convenience store bell rings whenever the door is opened, whether someone is going in or out. 
</p>
<p>
	In this way, humor rings on the way to terror, the same way humor rings on our way to apathy:

    alt="This evaluation graph shows the mistake going from far below the OK (apathy) to far above the OK (terror) and back again, pointing out how humor marks these transitions."
    style="max-width: 31rem;">

<p>
	If we’re in a convenience store, we can ring the bell by opening the door—but then not go through the door. We can do the same with humor, where humor rings, but we don’t change which zone we’re in:

    alt="This evaluation graph shows a mistake dipping toward an OK, producing humor without crossing the OK."
    style="max-width: 24rem;">
<p>
	We can also open and close the convenience store door repeatedly to keep dinging the bell. We can do something similar for humor too:

    title="Humor rings repeatedly by quickly transitioning zones"
    alt="This evaluation graph shows a mistake entwined around an OK."
    style="max-width: 22rem;">

<p>
	We’ll be using this way of thinking about our emotions <callback>(three emotional zones)</callback> throughout this book—which will let us keep our thinking organized when interpreting humor.
</p>

<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Scope.</headline> In this book, we'll be treating anger and sadness as similar enough to be treated as the same in this book <callback>("mistake-predominant emotions")</callback>.</p> 
   
 <p>This can seem odd at first, since we can distinquish between them and we're used to taking as close a look at things as possible&mdash;including emotions. At a close enough view, everything fractures and becomes different.</p>  
   
 <p>We can also take the other approach, where we pull back and things coalesce together. This book primarily focuses on this drawn-back view, as it's often an orderly place to start when thinking about how humor fits into emotions.</p> 
 
 <p>At the same time, that's not to say it's the only or even the best way to think about emotions. Instead, it's designed to support and complement other ways we think about emotions. </p>

<div class="content-example">
       
<p>Since we grew up with words like "humor" and "emotions," we often take them pretty seriously&mdash;like by assuming they're talking about stable things. But these words are nebulous, in part because they're based on a metaphor.</p> 

<p>In many ways, it's useful to actually think of words like "humor" and "emotions" as centuries-long slang words! That lets us take these words seriously but not formally&mdash;a word like "emotion" is more like "cool" than "helium."</p> 

<p>Let's go over a quick history of both of these words:</p>


<h2>Humor</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <p>Words like <sem-weak>humid, humidify, humidor, humus,</sem-weak> and so on all share the same root <callback>("moist, wet")</callback>&mdash;which is why humor historically means "juice of a plant or animal." So an apple had humor, and so did a squirrel.</p>
    
    <p>Humor didn't have any associtaion with emotions at all&mdash;until a few hundred years ago, when metaphorical human humors <callback>(human "juices")</callback> were used to label axes on a personality modeling graph.</p> 
    
    <p>So fluids like blood and black bile <callback>(melancholy)</callback> were human humors, and were used to describe moods. Eventually, the fluids were seen as an extraneous step, and "humor" came to directly mean something like "the malleable medium of disposition." <callback>(“The baby was in bad humor yesterday, but is in good humor today!”)</callback></p>
    
    <p>Over the next two hundred years or so, humor shifted from meaning "mallable medium of disposition" into all the things it also means today&mdash;which is a very broad tent, including overlapping meanings like "cause of laughter," "jokes in general," "interpersonal ability to generate laughter", "laughter associated with weirdness," "a feeling associated with laughter," and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>These modern meanings are slangy. We can feel this slanginess by imagining that we're saying "juice” instead of humor:</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
     <li>“he just has a great sense of juice about him”</li>
     <li>“there’s a lot of juice at their house”</li> 
     <li>"it's juice that makes life worth living"</li>
    <li>“the baby has good juices today!”</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p>We sometimes assume a common word like humor is grounded and formal. But it's actually an opportunistic, flexible, and vague word! This is only a problem if we think the word is something that it's not.</p>
    
    <div class="consider">
       
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">A slang meaning is when the meaning doesn't match the word's etymology&mdash;like how many meanings of today's "humor" is independent of moistness and liquids.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">This is different than other words, like "anger" and similar words like anguish, anxiety, angina, and so on. These words come from the root that means “<callback>painful, painfully constricted.”</callback></p>
     
           
        <p class="considertext">These words have all meant something like this for thousands of years. If we say someone is angry or anxious, we could still describe them as pained or constricted.</p> 
              
        <p class="considertext">Our sturdiest emotional words tend to be like this, like grieve, grave, aggravate, and so on, which come from the root of <callback>"heavy."</callback></p>
     
        <p class="considertext">This gives some context to quasi-emotional words like humor, which seem to exist in a different neighborhood than these more stable words.</p>
        </div>
    </div>


<h2>Emotion</h2> 
<div class="h2">
    <p>The word “emotion” was originally just a variation of the word “motion.” <term>Emotion</term> was just <em>motion</em> with an emphatic or expelling <sem-weak>e-</sem-weak> in front, leading to original uses like:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>an earthquake was emotion in the ground <callback>(the ground shakes, has motion)</callback></li>
        <li>a roving crowd had emotion <callback>(they moved together, com-motion)</callback></li>
        <li>a letter could cause a reader’s emotion <callback>(like pacing, from internal feelings)</callback></li></ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">and so on</p>
    
    <p>From there, the word eventually developed into its current sense—“cogitated feelings, especially strong ones (that cause movement).”</p> 
    
    <p>Sometimes, we use the word “emotion” expansively, to include all inner life. But in our day-to-day life, the meaning of “emotion” is constantly drifting back to motion&mdash;like how we think of stormy seas and blowing trees as emotional.</p> 
      
  <p>If a director says “let’s do the scene again, this time with more EMOTION!”—they don’t mean more vivid internal sensations. They mean more emoting, more expressive action in the body and face. </p>
       
<p>Similarly, we call cats emotionless&mdash;not because cats don't have feelings, moods, opinions, personality, preferences, reactions, and so on, because they obviously do&mdash;but because their faces don’t move. Cats can’t emote in the same way dogs can, with their moving <callback>(emotional)</callback> faces. </p>
    
<div class="consider">
       
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
        <p class="considertext">It's the same for people. When a novelist describes someone as "emotionless" they often mean they have a stony poker face, not that there's nothing happening inside them.</p>
    </div>
     
     <p>This association with movement is one reason emotion sometimes struggles to encompass everything we want it to, including things like intentions due to mood or tone of reflections.</p>
     
    </div> 


<p>To make sense of the changes in the words "humor" and "emotion," we have to spot the shared metaphor that carried them both to where they are today: that our disposition and feelings behave like liquid. </p> 

<p><term>Humors</term> <callback>(liquids)</callback> were particularly <em>emotional</em> <callback>(fluid)</callback>&mdash;which is like human feelings, which mix and behave like liquids in a container&mdash;and seem to infuse us, like sap or blood.</p>

<p>This is why these two words, humor and emotion, changed together from literally describing <term>fluids</term> and <term>movement</term> to metaphorically describing <em>feelings</em> and <em>cause of laughter</em>.</p>  

<p>One of the points of all this is to give a subtle escape from the modern sense of these words, which are often confusing and yet still dominant how we think about ourselves. Realizing we can step back and recognize them as metaphors can be freeing.</p>


<!--
<p>It also helps characterize this book's study of <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>&mdash;a description of laughing and smiling over time that involves thinking fluidly about evaluations over time. This incidentally helps describe other experiences as well&mdash;and, in some ways, helpfully re-uses the word "humor."</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider: </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">In this book, we’ll use the word “emotion,” since it’s familiar and good enough. But the definition we'll be using will be closer to older words for emotion, like affect or affection. </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">These words share the root “to do to,” and for thousands of years meant things like "disposition, mood, state of mind or body produced by some external influence” or “a relation, a temporary state" <callback>("the news deeply affected me")</callback> </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">In this book, emotions are “consequence of someone (having made) relations between things.” And since humor is defined as an emotion, humor is then a specific kind of relation that we make between things.</p> </div>

        Our evaluations

    <ul>
        <li>
            We always have a ratio of mistake and OK, which always produces emotions. However, this ratio only sometimes produce humor. By focusing on mistakes and OKs, we can see humor<strong><a href="4-1-our-evaluations-change-continuously.html">
