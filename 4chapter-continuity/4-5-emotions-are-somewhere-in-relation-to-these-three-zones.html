 Emotions are somewhere in relation to these three zones 
</h1>
 
 <!-- 04.50 -->
  
<p>
	Throughout this book, we’ll talk about emotions as being somewhere in relation to these three zones:
</p>
<div class="list-in-text">
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            Mistake-predominant emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>afraid</emotions>, <emotions>ashamed</emotions>, <emotions>bummed</emotions>, <emotions>confused</emotions>, <emotions>excited</emotions>, <emotions>irritated</emotions>, <emotions>focused</emotions>, <emotions>grieving</emotions>, <emotions>jealous</emotions>, <emotions>perplexed</emotions>, <emotions>sad</emotions>, <emotions>stressed</emotions>, <emotions>terror</emotions>, <emotions>worried</emotions>,
      
      <i>and so on</i>)</callback></p>
    
                <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            Balanced emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>humor</emotions>)</callback></p>
        
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>
            OK-predominant emotions</strong> <callback>(<emotions>apathetic</emotions>, <emotions>bored</emotions>, <emotions>calm</emotions>, <emotions>certain</emotions>, <emotions>content</emotions>, <emotions>convinced</emotions>, <emotions>detached</emotions>, <emotions>leisurely</emotions>, <emotions>listless</emotions>, <emotions>neutral</emotions>, <emotions>relaxed</emotions>, <emotions>stagnant</emotions>, <emotions>satisfied</emotions>, <emotions>tranquil</emotions>, <emotions>unexcited</emotions>, <i>and so on</i>)</callback> </p>
    </div>
<p>
	This helps us see humor as part of the same emotional landscape as other emotions. Humor isn’t <term>apart</term> from other emotions—instead, it has a specific place: humor is sandwiched <em>between</em> emotions like anger and calm.
</p>
<p>
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance"> For instance:</p>
	    <p class="for-instance-text">
	    It can seem odd that we sometimes laugh before moments of apathy and also sometimes laugh before moments of terror. But it’s not odd when we think of humor as equally adjacent to both apathy and terror. 
	    </p>
	    </div>
	    
	    <p>
	When we cross between these two emotional zones, humor “rings”—like how a convenience store bell rings whenever the door is opened, whether someone is going in or out. 
</p>
<p>
	In this way, humor rings on the way to terror, the same way humor rings on our way to apathy:

    style="max-width: 31rem;">

<p>
	If we’re in a convenience store, we can ring the bell by opening the door—but then not go through the door. We can do the same with humor, where humor rings, but we don’t change which zone we’re in: 
</p>

    alt=""
    style="max-width: 24rem;">
<p>
	We can also open and close the convenience store door repeatedly to keep dinging the bell. We can do something similar for humor too:

<p>
	We’ll be using this way of thinking about our emotions <callback>(three emotional zones)</callback> throughout this book—which will let us keep our thinking organized when interpreting humor.

        Our evaluations
        (mistakes, OKs) aren't static—our evaluations change over time. This lets us graph the magnitude of mistakes and OKs over time. 
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            We always have mistakes and OKs, which are always producing emotions. However, these evaluations only sometimes produce humor. By focusing on mistakes and OKs, we can see humor<a href="4-1-our-evaluations-change-continuously.html">
                coming from somewhere</a>, rather than nowhere.

    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
           Our evaluations then fall into and can move through one of these <a href="4-5-emotions-are-somewhere-in-relation-to-these-three-zones.html">
               three emotional zones</a>: OK-predominant evaluations; balanced evaluations (humor); and mistake-predominant evaluations. These zones blend into each other and don't have hard boundaries.
