   <p><headline>Scope.</headline> Even though we can distinguish different kinds of trees, sometimes its enough to simply talk about "trees."</p>
   
   <p>In this book, we'll be treating anger and sadness as similar enough to be treated as the same&mdash;we'll just call them <callback>"mistake-predominant emotions."</callback></p> 
   
 <p>We do this all the time, like how we can talk about "trees" in general sometimes. Even though we can distinquish them further. Sometimes, it's enough to simply talk about trees.</p>  
   
 <p>As we'll see, taking this approach will be an orderly place to start 

 We can also take the other approach, where we pull back and things coalesce together. This book primarily focuses on this drawn-back view, as it's often an orderly place to start when thinking about how humor fits into emotions.</p> 
 
 <p>At the same time, that's not to say it's the only or even the best way to think about emotions. Instead, it's designed to support and complement other ways we think about emotions. </p>
