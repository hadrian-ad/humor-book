Emotions are either OK-predominant or mistake-predominant</h1>

<!-- 04.40 -->

<p>Our evaluations have three emotional configurations&mdash;three <vocab>emotional zones</vocab></p>

<p>There is a <sem>mistake-predominant zone</sem>, where the <term>mistake</term> is larger than the <term>OK</term>. There's also the <sem>OK-predominant zone</sem>, where the <em>OK</em> is larger than the <em>mistake</em>.</p>
<p>
	These zones are separated by when these two evaluations are balanced: the <sem>balanced zone</sem>&mdash;humor:

<p>
	The line of highest-intensity humor is like a watershed line: on either side of it, the humor starts to change one of two ways&mdash;into either OK-predominant emotions or mistake-predominant emotions.
</p>
    
	<h2>Humor into mistake-predominance</h2>
	
	<div class="h2"><p>
	    While the mistake and OK balance, we feel intense humor. But if the mistake grows or the OK shrinks, we head toward the <sem>mistake-predominant zone</sem>:

	    <p>
	    As we head into the mistake-predominant zone, our emotional state contains less humor and more and more  mistake-predominant emotions, like <emotions>afraid</emotions>, <emotions>ashamed</emotions>, <emotions>bummed</emotions>, <emotions>confused</emotions>, <emotions>excited</emotions>, <emotions>irritated</emotions>, <emotions>focused</emotions>, <emotions>grieving</emotions>, <emotions>perplexed</emotions>, <emotions>jealous</emotions>, <emotions>sad</emotions>, <emotions>stressed</emotions>, <emotions>terrified</emotions>, <emotions>worried</emotions>, <i>and so on</i>.</p> 
	    
	    <p>
	    Eventually, there’s no humor, and we’re left with <sem>only</sem> mistake-predominant emotions.

        The opposite happens if we tilt toward the OK-predominant zone. At first, we feel intense humor. But if the mistake shrinks or the OK grows, we move further into the OK-predominant zone.

        As we head into the OK-predominant zone, our emotional state contains less humor and more and more  OK-predominant emotions like <emotions>apathetic</emotions>, <emotions>bored</emotions>, <emotions>calm</emotions>, <emotions>certain</emotions>, <emotions>content</emotions>, <emotions>convinced</emotions>, <emotions>detached</emotions>, <emotions>leisurely</emotions>, <emotions>listless</emotions>, <emotions>neutral</emotions>, <emotions>relaxed</emotions>, <emotions>stagnant</emotions>, <emotions>satisfied</emotions>, <emotions>tranquil</emotions>, <emotions>unexcited</emotions>, <i>and so on</i>.

        Eventually, the mistakes and OK are so far apart that our humor is gone, and we’re left with <sem>only</sem> an OK-predominant emotion:
