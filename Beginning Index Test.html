<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>This is a treatise on humor&mdash;we'll be looking systematically at the <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> of smiles and laughter. It'll be at least somewhat transformative and very interesting&mdash;you'll see.</p> 


<p>Humor is a puzzle. We often have an intuitive idea of why we laugh&mdash;but the more instances of humor we put together, the fuzzier the big picture can get, and the more incoherent everything can seem.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We're not usually surprised if our friend smiles when they see us&mdash;but we might be surprised if they unexpectedly smile at someone's pain. How can we explain these both together?</p>
</div>

<p>This puzzle get harder because of how close to the chest all this is. We've all been smiling and laughing since before we could talk&mdash;humor so foundational and familiar that it's hard to see clearly!</p>

<p>It's a bit like looking at our nose&mdash;only, in this case, our nose is also a puzzle that becomes more confusing the more pieces of it we consider at once. There's a dual challenge of having to notice what's right in front of our face at the same time we have to discover how it all fits together.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We don't always notice how much we don't notice about humor. We may always notice when someone doubles over with laughter at a joke, but we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> always notice when someone gets a hug and smiles, or hears a good point and laughs.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Like our nose, these smiles and laughs are invisibly normal, and sometimes have to be pointed out before we can notice them. This book is inclusive to <sem>all</sem> this "humor," giving us a life-accurate sample of smiles and laughs to think about.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">We'll be going over plenty of "invisible-visible" things about humor, which for most readers is a strange mixture of surprising and obvious at the same time. Once they're pointed out, we won't be able to unsee them.</p>
</div>

<p>This book is written for strong learning outcomes. We'll talk about humor with precision and coherance, using carefully sequenced chapters, thousands of examples, and hundreds of figures. Our goal is to unspool our experiences and find an elegant way of thinking about humor.</p> 

<p>By the time you finish, you'll be substantially better at observing, describing, understanding, and producing humor than when you started.</p>


<p>If you're ready, we'll get right to it!</p>




<p>In many ways, humor is one of the most important thing we can learn about. Since our smiles and laughs are so tightly laced into everything, the study of humor ends up being the study of just about everything&mdash;the study of humor is the study of how people relate to everything, and why. There's personal competence and satisfaction in this study.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p>
        <headline>Swords.</headline> Humor has a situational edge: something happens when people laugh, like stagnant water starting to move. We'll teasing out what is happening explicitly as we go along.</p>
        
        <p>There's an infamous Bible passage where Jesus says "I have come to bring not peace but the sword."</p>
    
              There's an infamous lecture by Jesus where he says he's come not to bring peace but the sword. An Irish copyist in the middle ages simply shrugged and miscopied <sem-weak>gladium</sem-weak> <callback>(sword)</callback> as <sem-weak>gaudium</sem-weak> <callback>(joy)</callback>. "I have not come to bring peace but joy."
    </p>
    
    <p>Is this funny? We maybe smiled at the contrast, and felt things. There's a lot to be said about all this.</p>
    
    <p>There's also something interesting to be said about the relation to joy and peace.</p>
</div>



<div class="box">
    <p>If we ignore laughter, we leave out something essential. If we're telling someone a story about how our friend insulted us and leave out that it made us laugh&mdash;we wouldn't really be sharing a clear story. The presence or absence of the laugh is the essential pivot of the experience.</p>
    
    <p>This is obvious with a story about insults, but we do something similar all the time&mdash;like if we tell someone we built a new road, and leave out whether people laughed or not.</p>
</div>


<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We leave out something essential if we tell someone that our best friend insulted us&mdash;but don't mention that they made us laugh. The laugh or the absence of a laugh is the essential pivot of the experience.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">In other words, studying humor is studying the pivotal aspect of experiences&mdash;which happens everwhere, from jokes to hugs to failures to chatting with strangers.</p> 
    
    <p>We don't usually learn about humor. It's a bit like telling a story and then not caring about the humor. As we'll see, this often happened (and sometimes still happens) with myths. A myth will describe a laughing deity and it's girdle and weapon, and 
    
     This is actually happens in our lives too. When we describe a building or road, we don't always think to describe whether people are laughing or not there&mdash;some kind of overlook. 
    
    </p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>We'll be defining how this book uses "humor" more carefully soon, but in brief, there's laughs and smiles&mdash;humor is inclusive to the <term>when</term> and <em>why</em> of laughs and smiles.</p>   
      
       

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">Some people might smile and laugh at the signs below. But why only <sem-weak>some</sem-weak> people, <sem-weak>some</sem-weak> of the time?</p>

	        Photo 1 has chalk writing above a hard-to-read danger sign, so it now reads 'unreadable signs cause ... danger.'
	        
	        Photo 2 shows a goat in a pen, behind a sign that warns 'goats have no manners.'
	        
	        Photo 3 shows a stop sign that confidently says 'DUR' instead of 'STOP'. (Dur is Turkish for stop.)
	        
	        At the bottom of all three photos is the book's question: 'why would someone laugh at these signs? (and only some people, some of the time?)'"
	        
	        title="why are things funny?">
	        
	        <p class="considertext">By the end of this course, it won't be challenging to describe who might laugh when, and why.</p>

<p>This course is designed to provide clarity. As we'll see, there are good ways of talking about and observing humor that just about everyone benefits from learning.</p>

   <p><headline>Outcomes.</headline> This is a serious course on humor&mdash;designed for strong learning outcomes in our ability to observe, describe, understand, and produce humor. The ability to do all this leads to greater competence at making social and design decisions.</p>
   
   <p>For instance, understanding why a stranger would or wouldn't smile helps avoid or connect with them&mdash;or helps us design events or spaces that are more likely to make strangers smile with each other.</p>

<p class="faq-question">
    Q. What is The Humor Book?
</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> <i>The Humor Book</i> is a step-by-step explanation of humor.</p>

This formal explanation of humor complements our intuitive understanding of humor.

<p class="faq-question">Q. So it's about jokes?</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Not specifically—this book is about the <sem>when</sem> and <sem>why</sem> of smiling and laughing. That's sometimes inclusive to jokes, but this book isn't specifically about them.</p>

<p>While we've laughed at <term>jokes</term> before, we've <em>also</em> laughed at insults, compliments, vegetables, hugs, success, failure, cute things, gross things, and so on.</p>

<p>We'll want to explain the presence or absence of laughter in <sem>all</sem> of these cases—for jokes as well as for hugs.</p>	


<p class="faq-question">Q. Can humor really be taught?</p>

<p>
    <strong>A.</strong> <sem>Yes!</sem> There are many myths about humor—like that humor is abstract, unknowable, undefinable, unteachable, and so on. None of those are true! Usually, those statements describe the speaker more than they describe humor: <callback>"humor is unteachable (by me)."</callback>
</p>  

<p>Humor is a coherent process—so we can model it! We can use this model to describe and predict things.</p>

<p class="faq-question">Alice, historian:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“I think about <i>[The Humor Book's]</i> theory of humor all the time.”</p>

<p class="faq-question">Natalie, women’s self-defense instructor:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“Humor is important in my line of work, but you have to be careful with it. <i>The Humor Book</i> really lays out a usable guide for putting people at ease without making people uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class="faq-question">Carmel, cafe owner:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“<i>The Humor Book</i> helps in building a coherent team and reaching customers. It helps me interact with different kinds of personalities.”</p>

<p class="faq-question">Chris, surgeon:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“<i>The Humor Book</i> taught me how and why unconventional humor has a strong effect on reducing tension in critical situations. This has helped me in my practice and has made me a better surgeon instructor.”</p>

<p class="faq-question">Alex, consultant:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“It’s super interesting how this book helps me think about my [two-year-old] daughter’s sense of humor.”</p>


<p class="faq-question">Barb, bookkeeper:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">"I like <i>[The Humor Book]</i> because it's inherently human stuff—it's really the foundation, being sensitive to each other. The in-and-out, the flow of moments, and emotion and reaction—I feel it really captured it well."</p> 

<p class="faq-question">Nick, musician:</p>

<p class="vig-indent">“<i>[The Humor Book]</i> really changed how I perceive music, since I see how music reaches positive humor outcomes. In the same way there’s dark humor, there’s dark music, and you can understand them similarly—why both can be enjoyable. And humor has a genre-bulldozing capability. I use [this book's] method of humor while writing music all the time."</p>

<p class="faq-question">Regan, engineer:</p>   

<p class="vig-indent">"The beautiful thing about this book is that it causes you to notice and appreciate an area of life that everyone agrees is important but receives very little formal investigation. I will be in the middle of a laugh with someone and cannot help but mentally dissect the situation with my new humor tools- which in turn makes me smile more."</p>
  
<p class="faq-question">Kayde, student:</p>
  
<p class="vig-indent"><book-title>The Humor Book</book-title> has given me a valuable lens through which to consider complex emotions like anger, joy, sadness, and&mdash;of course&mdash;humor. I have gained a better understanding of myself and the way I incorporate these emotions into my day-to-day interactions. After reading this book, I feel like I'm a better, more genuine communicator. </p>
