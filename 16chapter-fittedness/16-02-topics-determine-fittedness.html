<p>Fittedness increases when humor or humor attempts use relevant topics. When they use irrelevant topics, the fittedness decreases:</p>

 

<p>Artem is waiting for Alina at her lab. Hana asks if he’s related to Alina, and, shyly, he says yes.</p>

<p>Hana: (appreciatively) “Alina is really good at what she does.”</p>

<p>Artem: (awkwardly) “Yeah.”</p>

<p>There’s a moment of silence while Artem tries to think of something to say.</p>


<p class="vig-indent">Artem: “You know why elevators like libraries so much?”</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Hana: “Why?”</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Artem: “Because libraries have so many stories.” (&larr;joke on irrelevant topics makes humor attempt less fitted)</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Hana: *smiles* “Haha. Good one.”</p>

 




<p class="vig-indent">Artem: “She is a great DJ!” (&larr;Artem generates humor while continuing a topic (‘Alina’) that Hana expressed interest in)</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Hana: *laughs*</p>

 



 

<p class="vig-indent">“You must be good at what you do too, since you’re here! That’s so cool that you guys do all this cool stuff here!” (&larr;Artem includes other relevant topics like ‘Hana,’ ‘electrical engineering’, ‘lab,’ and so on, and tries to make Hana feel achievement)</p>

<p class="vig-indent">Hana: *smiles* “Haha, it’s not that impressive, but thanks.” (&larr;Hana feels achievement)</p>

 

 

<p>We can order these three jokes by order from least to most fitted:</p>



<p>Note that we're just looking at fittedness—not intensity. We can't know how intensely Artem or Hana felt humor just from the fittedness alone.</p> 

<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>

<p class="for-instance-text">Hana feels roughly the same intensity of humor in each example. But even though the intensity stays the same, the fittedness changes. That's because fittedness and intensity are two different measures, which can change independent of each other.</p>

 


 

<p>Attempts. In this book, “humor” is an emotion, while a “humor attempt” is an action that tries to generate that emotion. The term humor attempt is inclusive to jokes, but also much wider than jokes. </p>

  <p>A joke can exist inertly in a book. The humor attempt would be using that joke—inclusive of the delivery, intention, situation, and so on. In this case, the joke would just be a part of the humor attempt:</p>

  

<p>This is why a hundred people telling the same joke are using one joke but making a hundred different humor attempts. No one would be talking to the same person; using the same delivery; speaking at the same time of day; and so on.</p> 

<p>Humor attempts are broader than jokes too because anything that intends someone to feel humor is a humor attempt. This means bringing our parents tea is a humor attempt—because we want them to smile and experience belonging, comfort, delight, and so on. It's not a "joke"—it's a humor attempt.</p>

<p>A humor attempt may or may not actually generate any humor. We may bring our parents tea, hoping to make them smile—but maybe they ignore us, or cry or shout. It's still a humor attempt (we wanted them to experience belonging, comfort, and so on)—just not one that generate humor.</p>

<p>We can think about the fittedness of both humor (an emotion) and humor attempts (an action). We use the same process for finding the fittedness of both. For instance, we looked at the fittedess of Artem's humor attempts with Hana using topics—which can be done no matter what Artem or Hana feel in result.</p>
