<p>Fittedness increases when humor or humor attempts have <term>relevant</term> <a href="../6chapter-topics/6-0-topics.html">topics</a>. Fittedness decreases when they have <em>irrelevant</em> topics:</p>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Artem is waiting for Alina at her lab. Hana asks if he’s related to Alina, and, shyly, he says yes.</narration></p>

    <p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <internalaction>(awkwardly)</internalaction> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>There’s a moment of silence while Artem tries to think of something to say.</narration></p>

<p>We can order these three jokes by order from least to most fitted:</p>

    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Above, we're just looking at fittedness of a humor attempts above—<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> intensity of humor.</p> 
        
    <p class="considertext">Hana feels roughly the same intensity of humor in each example. But even though the intensity stayed the <term>same</term>, the fittedness <em>varied</em>. That's because fittedness and intensity are two different measures, which can change independent of each other.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Attempts.</headline> In this book, humor is an <term>emotion</term>, while a <vocab>humor attempt</vocab> is an <em>action</em> that tries to generate humor.</p>
    
      <p>A joke can exist inertly in a book. The humor attempt would be <sem>using</sem> that joke—inclusive of the content, delivery, intention, situation, and so on. In this case, the joke would just be a part of the humor attempt:</p>

    <p>So if a hundred people tell the same joke, they're using one joke but making a hundred different humor attempts&mdash;since each person using the same joke would be:</p> 
    
<ul class="close-list">
        <li>talking to a different person </li>
        <li>using a different inflection</li>
        <li>have a different relation to the joke</li>
        <li>speaking at different times of day</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p><sem-weak>Anything</sem-weak> that intends someone to feel humor is a humor attempt. So bringing our parents <sem>tea</sem> is a humor attempt—so long as we want them to <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell> and <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome> and experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on. Bringing someone tea isn't a "joke"—but the tea is involved in a humor attempt anyway.</p>
    
    <p>A humor attempt may or may not actually generate any humor. We may bring our parents tea, hoping to make them smile—but they may ignore us, or cry or shout in anger. In this case, it's still a humor attempt <callback>(we wanted them to experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, and so on)</callback>—just a humor attempt that didn't generate humor.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">We can use the same process to find the fittedness of both humor <callback>(the emotion)</callback> and humor attempts <callback>(the action)</callback>.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">We looked at the fittedness of Artem's humor attempts with Hana. We can do this whether or not Artem or Hana actually feel humor.</p>
