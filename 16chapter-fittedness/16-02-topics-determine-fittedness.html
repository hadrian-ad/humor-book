<p>Fittedness increases when humor or humor attempts have <term>relevant</term> <a href="../6chapter-topics/6-0-topics.html">topics</a>. When they have <em>irrelevant</em> topics, the fittedness decreases:</p>

    <p><narration>Artem is waiting for Alina at her lab. Hana asks if he’s related to Alina, and, shyly, he says yes.</narration></p>

    <p><speaker>Artem:</speaker> <internalaction>(awkwardly)</internalaction> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech></p>

<p>We can order these three jokes by order from least to most fitted:</p>

<p>Note that we're just looking at fittedness of a humor attempt—not intensity of humor.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Hana feels roughly the same intensity of humor in each example. But even though the intensity stays the same, the fittedness changes. That's because fittedness and intensity are two different measures, which can change independent of each other.</p>
    
    </div> 


 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Attempts.</headline> In this book, <term>“humor”</term> is an <em>emotion</em>, while a <term>“humor attempt”</term> is an <em>action</em> that tries to generate humor.</p>
    
      <p>A joke can exist inertly in a book. The <vocab>humor attempt</vocab> would be <sem>using</sem> that joke—inclusive of the delivery, intention, situation, and so on. In this case, the joke would just be a part of the humor attempt:</p>

    <p>So if a hundred people tell the same joke, they're using one joke but making a hundred different humor attempts&mbash;since no one would be talking to the same person; using the same delivery; speaking at the same time of day; and so on.</p> 
    
    <p><sem>Anything</sem> that intends someone to feel humor is a humor attempt. Bringing our parents tea is a humor attempt—because we want them to smile and experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on. It's not a "joke"—but the tea is involved in a humor attempt.</p>
    
    <p>A humor attempt may or may not actually generate any humor. We may bring our parents tea, hoping to make them smile—but they may ignore us, or cry or shout in anger. It's still a humor attempt <callback>(we wanted them to experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, and so on)</callback>—just a humor attempt that didn't generate humor.</p>
    
    <p>We can think about the fittedness of both humor <callback>(an emotion)</callback> and humor attempts <callback>(an action)</callback>. We use the same process for finding the fittedness of both. For instance, we looked at the fittedess of Artem's humor attempts with Hana using topics—which can be done no matter what Artem or Hana feel in result.</p>
