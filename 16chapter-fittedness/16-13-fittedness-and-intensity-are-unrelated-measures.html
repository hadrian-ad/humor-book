<p>We can graph fittedness:</p>
 

<p>We can graph intensity:</p>



<p>And we can graph them together at the same time:</p>



<p>This lets us visually compare Jasper’s and Justin's humor attempts. Jasper’s humor attempt was less fitted and generated greater intensity of humor:</p>

  

<p>Sometimes, we think that the fittedness and intensity of humor are related in some way—like that if one goes up, the other must go down.</p> 
 
<p>But fittedness and intensity aren’t connected—they’re separate measures. Below, we can see that one of Sam's anecdotes was both more fitted and generated more intense humor:</p>
 

<p>One variation was better by both measures.</p>

<p>That's because fittedness and intensity are independent measures, and we can’t correlate between them. We can't find one from the other—instead, we have to look for both fittedness and intensity.</p>
