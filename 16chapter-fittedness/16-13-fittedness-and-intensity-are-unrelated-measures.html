<p>We can graph fittedness:</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 9rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>We can graph intensity:</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 7rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>And we can graph them together at the same time:</p>

<p>This lets us visually compare Jasper’s and Justin's humor attempts:</p>

    <p><headline>Dependence.</headline> Sometimes, we think that the fittedness and intensity of humor are related in some way—like that if one goes up, the other must go down.</p> 
     
    <p>But fittedness and intensity <term>aren’t</term> connected—they’re separate measures. Below, we can see that one of Sam's anecdotes was <em>both</em> more fitted and generated more intense humor:</p>

    <p>One variation was better by both measures.</p>
    
    <p>That's because fittedness and intensity are independent measures, and we can’t correlate between them. Since we can't find one from the other, we have to look for both fittedness and intensity.</p>

<p>Emotional actions and intentions have degrees of comparative fit to their emotional situation. We can estimate this "fittedness." Fittedness is a measure of appropriateness to situation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>We can estimate fittedness of humor or humor attempts by accounting for relevancy of <a href="16-02-topics-determine-fittedness.html">topics</a>, <a href="16-03-humor-family-words-determine-fittedness.html">humor family words</a>, and <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">humor outcomes</a>. </li>
    
    <li>We can use these elements of fittedness to develop <a href="16-04-we-can-use-humor-family-words-as-hook-for-fitted-humor.html">methodology</a> for making fitted humor attempts. Higher fittedness tends to lead to greater toleration and breader emotional activity on an emotion network.</li>
    
    <li>Fittedness and intensity are two different quantitative measures in our model of humor. They are <a href="16-13-fittedness-and-intensity-are-unrelated-measures.html">independent</a> variables.</li>
