    <p><headline>Independence.</headline> Fittedness isn't related to intensity. While Hana feels roughly the same <term>intensity</term> of <term>humor</term> in each example, the <em>fittedness</em> of the <em>humor attempt</em> varied.</p>  

    <p>That's because fittedness and intensity are two different measures, which can change independent of each other.</p>

<p>In the same way we can visually represent fittedness:</p>

<p>We can visualize them together:</p>

<p><headline>Independence.</headline> Fittedness and intensity aren’t connected—they’re separate measures.</p> 
   
   <p>Below, we can see that one of Sam's anecdotes was <sem>both</sem> more fitted and generated more intense humor&mdash;one variation was better by both measures!</p>

<p>A <term>small</term> difference isn't the same thing as an <em>unimportant</em> difference. This is obvious with screws. When we need to be precise, a millimeter is the difference between something working and something not working.</p> 
   
   <p>It's the same for fittedness, where a word or small inflection is the difference between something being fitted and something being unfitted&mdash;the "millimeter" adjustments that determine whether humor or a humor attempt fits or not.</p>
    
    <p>These small differences are often the controlling factor in what's fitted or not. These may be a split second of eye-contact, a small movement of the mouth, a quick orientation of relevance, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>These small details involved in fittedness 
    can seem hard to manage and finicky at first. But it's not <sem>uniquely</sem> finicky&mdash;fittedness in humor is actually no more or less finicky than everything else. We work under the neccessity for small details for screws, drawing, music rhythms, proper spelling, pronuciation, matching paint colors, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>Like every skill, the "finickiness" slowly disappears as it increasingly becomes naturalized into our intuitive understanding. The ability of small changes to have big effects eventually gives us greater efficiency of action.</p>
    
    <p>Eventually, we come to appreciate the functionality of higher-sensitivity systems, and any beginner frustration gets replaced by pleasure at the sense of fine control. The finickiness is actually the spark that gives these systems their own life and complexity.</p>
    
    <p>In this book, we've been developing a pragmatic model of evaluatory systems. We're not modeling a simple system! It works by intricately compounded signals&mdash;where small details can change the big picture.</p>
    
    <p>We've said this evaluatory system is the base of our life and experiences&mdash;it's the <a href="../13chapter-evaluatory-information/13-05-we-care-about-evaluatory-information-more-than-content-information.html">reactive context</a> that everything happens in. That means understanding this base is understanding the frame in which it all happens&mdash;from how we make and keep friends, intake information, and live with awareness.</p>
