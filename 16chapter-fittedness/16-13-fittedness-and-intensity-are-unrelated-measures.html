    <p><headline>Independence.</headline> Fittedness isn't related to intensity. While Hana feels roughly the same <term>intensity</term> of <term>humor</term> in each example, the <em>fittedness</em> of the <em>humor attempt</em> varied.</p>  

    <p>That's because fittedness and intensity are two different measures, which can change independent of each other.</p>

<p>In the same way we can visually represent fittedness:</p>

<p><headline>Independence.</headline> Fittedness and intensity aren’t connected—they’re separate measures.</p> 
   
   <p>Below, we can see that one of Sam's anecdotes was <sem>both</sem> more fitted and generated more intense humor&mdash;one variation was better by both measures!</p>

<p>A <term>small</term> difference isn't the same thing as an <em>unimportant</em> difference. This is obvious with screws&mdash;when we need to be precise, a millimeter is the difference between something working and something not working.</p> 
   
   <p>It's the same for fittedness. A single word or small inflection&mdash;a split second of eye-contact or small movement of the mouth&mdash;these can be the "millimeter" adjustment that determenes whether whether humor or a humor attempt fits or not.</p>
        
    <p>These small details involved in fittedness 
    can seem hard to manage and finicky at first. But it's worth noting this isn't <sem>uniquely</sem> finicky. We work under the neccessity for small details for screws, drawing, music rhythms, proper spelling, pronuciation, matching paint colors, and so on.</p> 
    
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            <p class="considertext">Matching the color of paint 98% doesn't cut it&mdash;the orchestra being 98% on time doesn't cut it&mdash;spelling 98% of the words correctly in a book doesn't cut it. It's completely normal that things are finicky!</p>  </div>
    
    <p>Like every skill, the "finickiness" slowly disappears as it becomes increasingly naturalized into our intuitive understanding. And eventually the way small changes have big effects is understood as leverage for great range of action with small effort.</p>
    
    <p>This is why we come to appreciate the functionality of any higher-sensitivity system with practice. Our beginner frustration gets replaced by pleasure at the sense of fine control. The initial finickiness is actually the spark that gives these systems their own life and complexity.</p>
    
    <p>Our evaluatory systems work by intricately compounded signals, where small details can change the big picture. Like a lever, this gives us a way to make a lot of difference with small movements&mdash;and constitutes many of the upper-end skills involved in interactions.</p>

    
            
    <!--
    <p>This evaluatory system is the base of our life and experiences. Everything happens in it! It's the frame we live in. That means understanding this base is understanding the frame in which it all happens&mdash;from how we make and keep friends, intake information, and live with awareness.</p>

<p>Elements of fittedness imply their own methodologies for when and how to make fitted humor attempts. For instance, <emotion>comfort</emotion> makes the most sense when someone is uncomfortable.</p>


<ul>
    
    <li>When we fill our interactions with fitted humor attempts, people respond positively. When we avoid fitted humor attempts, people feel things are <a href="16-06-our-interactions-feel-stilted-without-fitted-humor.html">stilted or odd</a>.</li>
    
    <li>Fittedness is often controlled by <a href="16-12-fittedness-is-influenced-by-circumstances.html">small details</a>. A very small proportion of our conversation may be dedicated to relevance, but it can have an outsized difference on fittedness.</li>
    
    
    <li>Fittedness and intensity are two different measures in our model of humor. They are <a href="16-13-fittedness-and-intensity-are-unrelated-measures.html">independent</a> variables. Something fitted is neither funny or unfunny, but could be either&mdash;and vice versa.</li>
