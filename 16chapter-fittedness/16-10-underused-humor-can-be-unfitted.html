    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Underused humor can be unfitted</h1>
    

<p>Sometimes, humor is unfitted when it’s <term>overused</term>. <callback>(We laugh so hard we miss a customer.)</callback> But other times, humor is unfitted because it’s <em>underused</em>:</p>

     <p><narration>Trevor and Minh are trying to pass each other in the hallway—they do a little dance trying to get around each other, Minh smiles and Trevor puts his hands on his face in mock frustration, until they finally pass each other.

    <p><narration>Max is at an event with live music, and he stands stiffly near the wall holding a plastic cup. He wants to feel involved while somehow also not involving himself.

    <p>In the same way people censure what they see as an unfitted <term>excess</term> of humor tells <callback>(“ladies!”)</callback> people also censure what they see an unfitted <em>absence</em> of humor tells:</p>

    </div>
    
<p>These are examples where it wasn't the <term>presence</term> of humor tells that was unfitted, but their <em>absence</em>.</p>

<p>When people bring up a lack of <term>humor tells</term>, they're often just using them as a proxy for a lack of movement toward <em>humor outcomes</em>:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>The manager wanted Jessica to smile <callback>(because the manager wanted Jessica to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> with customers)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Jessica wanted her manager to smile <callback>(because she wanted Marie to <humor-outcome>change negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Trevor wanted Minh to lighten up <callback>(because he wanted Minh to <humor-outcome>ease</humor-outcome> (his own) <humor-outcome>tension</humor-outcome>)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Sabrina thought Artem should seem less serious <callback>(in order to better help him <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome> with potential matches)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Emma wanted Max to relax (<callback>in order to <humor-outcome>become less defensive</humor-outcome></callback>).</li> 
    </ul>
    
<p>This is why we won't focus much on humor tells as a source of fittedness in this book—because it's usually more precise to think about humor outcomes instead.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    

    <p class="for-instance-text">If Jessica can <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> <outcome-contrast>without</outcome-contrast> smiling, the manager doesn't have much reason to care that Jessica isn't <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>. Focusing on the lack of smiling would be confusing the means for the ends.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">More generally, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is the goal <sem>everywhere</sem>. We can be confident in saying that a thousand years ago strangers everywhere wanted to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> when they arrive for a party&mdash;even though the humor tells they did or didn't use would vary person-by-person, place-by-place.</p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> The intensity of humor also has a fittedness. Since humor tells express intensity, the fittedness of intensity is already baked in to the fittedness of humor tells. For instance, a <humor-tell>loud laugh</humor-tell> is fitted in different places than a <humor-tell>quiet laugh</humor-tell> is.</p>
    
    <p>We often intuitively know these things—like when we laugh so loudly that everyone in the class turns around to look at us, or when we beam throughout a funeral. In these cases, the intensity of a humor tell is unfitted.</p>
    
    <p>It's not just <term>too much</term> intensity that can be unfitted—sometimes <em>too little</em> intensity is seen as unfitted. We saw this with Jessica's manager&mdash;who sometimes saw <term>high-intensity</term> humor as <em>unfitted</em> <callback>("ladies!")</callback>, she also saw <term>low-intensity</term> humor as <em>unfitted</em> <callback>("smile more")</callback>.  The intensity was seen as fitted within a low and high range.</p>
