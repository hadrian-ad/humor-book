<p>Sometimes, humor is unfitted when it’s overused, like when we laugh so hard we miss a customer or distract the office. But other times, humor is unfitted because it’s underused:</p>

<p>Trevor and Minh are trying to pass each other in the hallway. They do a little dance trying to get around each other, until they manage to get by each other. (&larr;no humor tells)</p>

<p class="vig-or">- OR -</p>

 <p>Trevor and Minh are trying to pass each other in the hallway—they do a little dance trying to get around each other, Minh smiles and Trevor puts his hands on his face in mock frustration, until they finally pass each other (&larr;smiling, touching self, informal movement)</p>

 

<p>Artem is editing his dating bio. “Likes GrosTech (early albums), mythology, and games. (&larr;no presented humor tells)</p>

<p class="vig-or">- OR -</p>

<p>Artem is editing his dating bio. “Likes GrosTech (early albums), mythology, and games. Did I mention I *really* like GrosTech!?” (&larr;writes with informal style, high energy)</p>

 

<p>Max is at an event with live music, and he stands stiffly near the wall holding a plastic cup. He wants to feel involved while somehow also not involving himself. But dancing is stupid, and everything here is dull. From across the room people can see him looking stiff and out of place. (&larr;Max has no humor tells)</p>

<p class="vig-or">- OR -</p>

<p>Max is at an event with live music, and he’s loose and smiling, moving a bit to the music, loosely holding a plastic cup. (&larr;smiling, informal movement, loosening)</p> 
<p>He sees people across the room, and wanders over to see what they’re looking at. He feels like part of the event. (&larr;social seeking, social integration)</p> 

<p>In the same way people censure what they see as an unfitted excess of humor tells (“ladies!”) people also censure what they see an unfitted absence of humor tells:</p>
 

<p>“Jessica!” the manager tells her. “You need to smile more!” (&larr;the manager censures Jessica for her lack of humor tells)</p>

 

<p>Jessica: *to Emma* “I’ve never seen Marie smile or relax. Not once! It makes me sad.” (&larr;Jessica is frustrated about her manager’s lack of humor tells)</p>

 

<p>Trevor complains to Yasmin about Minh. “He should lighten up once in a while! He always looks like it’s his last day on earth!” (&larr;Trevor complains about Minh’s lack of humor tells)</p>

 

<p>Sabrina is going through her dating app and comes across Artem’s bio. “’Likes GrosTech (early albums), mythology, and games?’ Why does everyone who listens to GrosTech have to take themselves so seriously all the time?” (&larr;Sabrina thinks Artem’s lack of presented humor tells is self-defeating)</p>

 

<p>Drunk Emma finds Max at the event. He’s standing around like a cadaver with a plastic cup. “Max!” Emma says. “You hafta relax from time to time, man.” (&larr;Emma censures Max for a lack of humor tells) 
    </p>

<p>These are examples where people felt the lack of humor tells was unfitted, not the presence of them.</p>

<p>When people bring up a lack of humor tells, they're often just using them as a proxy for a lack of movement toward humor outcomes:</p> 

The manager wanted Jessica to smile because the manager wanted Jessica to create rapport with customers.
Jessica wanted her manager to smile because she wanted Marie to change negative emotions into positive ones.
Trevor wanted Minh to lighten up because he wanted Minh to ease (his own) tension.
Sabrina thought Artem should seem less serious in order to better help him become accepted with potential matches.
Emma wanted Max to relax in order to become less defensive. 

<p>This is why we won't focus much on humor tells as a source of fittedness in this book—because it's usually more precise to think about humor outcomes instead.</p>

<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>

<p class="for-instance-text">If Jessica is good at creating rapport with customers without smiling, focusing on smiling would be confusing the means for the ends—since the goal is to create rapport, not Jessica smiling.</p>

<p class="for-instance-text">If Jessica can create rapport without smiling, the manager doesn't have much reason to care that Jessica isn't smiling. Similarly, creating rapport is the goal everywhere—while attitudes toward smiling change decade-by-decade, region-by-region, establishment-by-establishment. For these reasons creating rapport is often a better focus than humor tells, like smiling.</p>

 

 

<p>Intensity. The intensity of humor also has a fittedness. This is baked into thinking about humor tells—because humor tells express intensity. For instance, a loud laugh is fitted in different places than a quiet laugh is.</p>

<p>We often intuitively know these things—like when we laugh so loudly that everyone in the class turns around to look at us, or when we beam throughout a funeral. In these cases, the intensity of a humor tell is unfitted.</p>

<p>It's not just too much intensity that can be unfitted—sometimes too little intensity is seen as unfitted. So while Jessica's manager sometime saw high-intensity humor as unfitted ("ladies!"), she also saw low-intensity humor as unfitted ("smile more"). The intensity was seen as fitted within a low and high range.</p>
