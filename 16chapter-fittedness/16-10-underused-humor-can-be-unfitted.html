    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Underused humor can be unfitted</h1>
    

<p>Sometimes, humor is unfitted when it’s <term>overused</term>, like when we laugh so hard we miss a customer or distract the office. But other times, humor is unfitted because it’s <em>underused</em>:</p>

    <p>In the same way people censure what they see as an unfitted <term>excess</term> of humor tells <callback>(“ladies!”)</callback> people also censure what they see an unfitted <em>absence</em> of humor tells:</p>

<p>These are examples where it wasn't the <term>presence</term> of humor tells that was unfitted, but their <em>absence</em>.</p>

<p>When people bring up a lack of humor tells, they're often just using them as a proxy for a lack of movement toward humor outcomes:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>The manager wanted Jessica to smile because the manager wanted Jessica to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> with customers.</li>
    <li>Jessica wanted her manager to smile because she wanted Marie to <humor-outcome>change negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>.</li>
    <li>Trevor wanted Minh to lighten up because he wanted Minh to <humor-outcome>ease</humor-outcome> (his own) <humor-outcome>tension</humor-outcome>.</li>
    <li>Sabrina thought Artem should seem less serious in order to better help him <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome> with potential matches.</li>
    <li>Emma wanted Max to relax in order to become less defensive.</li> 
    </ul>
    
<p>This is why we won't focus much on humor tells as a source of fittedness in this book—because it's usually more precise to think about humor outcomes instead.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If Jessica is good at <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> with customers without smiling, focusing on smiling would be confusing the means for the ends—since the goal is for Jessica to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, not to <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If Jessica can <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> without smiling, the manager doesn't have much reason to care that Jessica isn't <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Similarly, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is the goal <sem>everywhere</sem>—while attitudes toward <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell> change decade-by-decade, region-by-region, establishment-by-establishment. For these reasons <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is often a better focus than humor tells, like <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>.</p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> The intensity of humor also has a fittedness. This is baked into thinking about humor tells—because humor tells express intensity. For instance, a <humor-tell>loud laugh</humor-tell> is fitted in different places than a <humor-tell>quiet laugh</humor-tell> is.</p>
    
    <p>We often intuitively know these things—like when we laugh so loudly that everyone in the class turns around to look at us, or when we beam throughout a funeral. In these cases, the intensity of a humor tell is unfitted.</p>
    
    <p>It's not just <term>too much</term> intensity that can be unfitted—sometimes <em>too little</em> intensity is seen as unfitted. So while Jessica's manager sometime saw high-intensity humor as unfitted <callback>("ladies!")</callback>, she also saw low-intensity humor as unfitted <callback>("smile more")</callback>. The intensity was seen as fitted within a low and high range.</p>
