<p>Often, the wider circumstances change the fittedness too:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Jasper is doing stand-up.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Jasper:</speaker> <speech>“Okay, okay. So here’s another joke. Let’s see. So there are two recovering alcoholics, right? And they sit down. And they’re like—let’s get our act together and finally be rock stars, like we always wanted. So they start trying to write a song. But they can’t get past the first two bars!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>The audience guffaws. Sam laughs, but feels this joke is maybe lightly inappropriate here.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels there’s something a bit off about this joke)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or">- OR -</p>
    
        <p><narration>Justin goes to his weekly hangout with his sober friends to talk about life.</narration></p>
        
         <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <speech>“I didn’t always want to be a professor. I wanted to be a singer once, you know, be in a band. So I tried to write a song once… but I couldn’t get past the first two bars!”</speech></p>
         
         <p><narration>Everyone groans, and a few people even laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Justin’s joke has relevant topics to him and his friends, and creates emotions of release and acceptance)</notes></p>

<p>Even though both Justin and Jasper had similar content in their joke, Justin’s humor attempt was more fitted to his listeners—Justin had more contextual justification for his humor attempt than Jasper.</p>
