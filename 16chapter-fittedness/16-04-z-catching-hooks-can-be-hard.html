<p>Hooks can sometimes be hard to catch:  
  
     <!--
      <div class="vignette">
          <p><narration>Yasmin is at an party hosted by Amber. She doesn't know anyone and feels isolated and uncomfortable. </narration></p> 
        <p>
            <speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <internalaction>(anxious)</internalaction> <action>*to Amber*</action> <speech>"I don't know anyone here."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin shares a sense of isolation and discomfort&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help her feel <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>connection</emotions>)</notes>

        <p><narration>Yasmin didn't know what she expected. That Amber would introduce her to people? Give her encouragement? She sits in the corner until she feels it's polite to leave.</narration></p>

        <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Emma is listening to music so loudly everyone at the library can hear it through her earbuds. As she gets up to go to the bathroom, a student flags her down.</narration>
    </p> 
       
         <p><speaker>Student:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>"Are you ever worried about your eardrums?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;student shares a discomfort and annoyance&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help student feel <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on)</notes></p>
           <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*sincerely*</action> <speech>"No! But thanks for asking"</speech> <action>*goes on to bathroom*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma missed the point of the student's comment)</notes></p>

        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*mouth suddenly dry*</action> <speech>“So… I weighed myself the other day. I’ve lost ten pounds.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor shares an achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help him feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>)</notes></p>

        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*embarrassed*</action> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor stops offering hook)</notes></p>
    </div> 
    
    <p>Trevor was trying to offer a hook, but didn’t contextualize it enough for Minh—Minh wasn’t sure what Trevor was looking for.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">There was trouble from both ends—<term>Trevor</term> didn't explicitly offer enough of a hook at the same time <em>Minh</em> didn't have enough practice to spot the implicit hook.</p>
        
    </div>
    

<p>Other times, we're used to prioritizing hooks for ourselves. Sometimes, when someone is uncomfortable, <sem>we</sem> become uncomfortable&mdash;and then we try to make <sem-weak>ourselves</sem-weak> comfortable instead of them.</p>

        <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <internalaction>(uncomfortable)</internalaction> <action>*trying to think of something to say*</action> <speech>"Like your criticisms of her home decor?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam tries to make himself feel <emotions>comfort</emotions> more than he tries to make Jennifer feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions> or <emotions>connection</emotions>)</notes></p>

 <div class="box">
        <p><headline>Closeness.</headline> Fitted humor attempts can seem frightening if they seem difficult or high-stakes. Sometimes, we're not used to initiating and sustaining emotional connection with others, and we shy away from it&mdash;like Sam, who recognized a hook for fitted humor, but pruned away the fitted elements in his rely.</p> 
        
        <p>Things can be extra hard too if we think humor like <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on require eloquence and wit&mdash;instead of things that sometimes require holding hands or simply being sincere. <callback>("She was so lucky to have you as a daughter.")</callback></p>
