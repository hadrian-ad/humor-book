    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">It can be hard to catch hooks</h2>

    <p>We sometimes don't catch hooks:</p>  
  
     <!--
      <div class="vignette">
          <p><narration>Yasmin is at an party hosted by Amber. She doesn't know anyone and feels isolated and uncomfortable. </narration></p> 
        <p>
            <speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <internalaction>(anxious)</internalaction> <action>*to Amber*</action> <speech>"I don't know anyone here."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin shares a sense of isolation and discomfort&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help her feel <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>connection</emotions>)</notes>
        </p> 
        <p><speaker>Amber:</speaker> <internalaction>(delighted) </internalaction><speech>"Then you have a chance to meet them!"</speech> <action>*moves on*</action> <notes>(&larr;Amber doesn't follow hook in a way that makes Yasmin feel humor)</notes></p>
        
        <p><narration>Yasmin didn't know what she expected. That Amber would introduce her to people? Give her encouragement? She sits in the corner until she feels it's polite to leave.</narration></p>
        
    </div>

        <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Emma is listening to music so loudly everyone at the library can hear it through her earbuds. As she gets up to go to the bathroom, a student flags her down.</narration>
    </p> 
       
         <p><speaker>Student:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>"Are you ever worried about your eardrums?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;student shares a discomfort and annoyance&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help student feel <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on)</notes></p>
           <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*sincerely*</action> <speech>"No! But thanks for asking"</speech> <action>*goes on to bathroom*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma missed the point of the student's comment)</notes></p>
     </div> 
       
       -->
        
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*mouth suddenly dry*</action> <speech>“So… I weighed myself the other day. I’ve lost ten pounds.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor shares an achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help him feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>)</notes></p>
        <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <speech>“Oh?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh is unsure how to take Trevor’s comment)</notes></p>
        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*embarrassed*</action> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor stops offering hook)</notes></p>
    </div> 
    
    <p>Trevor was trying to offer a hook, but didn’t contextualize it enough for Minh&mdash;Minh wasn’t sure what Trevor was looking for.</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">There was trouble from both ends&mdash;<term>Trevor</term> didn't explicitly offer enough of a hook at the same time <em>Minh</em> didn't have enough practice to spot the implicit hook.</p>
        
    </div>
    

<p>Other times, we're used to prioritizing hooks for <sem-weak>ourselves</sem-weak>. So if someone else is uncomfortable, <sem>we</sem> become uncomfortable&mdash;and then we try to make <term>ourselves</term> comfortable instead of <em>them</em>:</p>
  
   
<div class="vignette">
       <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <internalaction>(sad)</internalaction> <speech>"I keep thinking of things I never told mom."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer shares a regret&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help her feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on)</notes></p>
        <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <internalaction>(uncomfortable)</internalaction> <action>*trying to think of something to say*</action> <speech>"Like your criticisms of her home decor?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam tries to make himself feel <emotions>comfort</emotions> more than he tries to make Jennifer feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions> or <emotions>connection</emotions>)</notes></p>
        <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <internalaction>(sad)</internalaction> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>"Yeah."</speech></p>   
        </div>
        
        <p>Above, Sam doesn't prioritize generating humor in Jennifer. He  instead says something that would generate humor for <sem>him</sem>&mdash;which leads to a dividing moment between them.</p> 

 <div class="box">
        <p><headline>Closeness.</headline> If we're not used to initaiting and sustaining emotional connection with others, it can feel difficult, frightening, or high stakes to try to generate fitted humor.</p>
        
        
        <p>This can make us shy away from them&mdash;like Sam, who recognized a moment for fitted humor <callback>(a need for <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on)</callback>&mdash;but took what he saw was an easier route, which ended up not meeting the moment.</p>
          
        <p>Things can be extra hard too if we think humor like <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on <sem>require</sem> eloquence and wit&mdash;like Sam trying to be witty. Instead, fitted humor can often be generated simply by being sincere or holding hands. <callback>("She was so lucky to have you as a daughter.")</callback></p>
