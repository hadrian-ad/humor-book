<p>Sometimes, people telegraph hooks to us—like when Emma said she was accepted for the conference, which is a clear hook for Jessica to congratulate her.</p> 

<p>But other times, we can create our own opportunities to push for humor family words. Heather does this below—she sets up her own hook, and follows it herself:</p>

 

<p>Heather: *looking at screen* “Remember when you won that online tournament in this game? (&larr;Heather creates her own hook) That was fun!” (&larr;Heather tries to make Xiaowei feel achievement)</p>

<p>Xiaowei: *smiles* (&larr;Xiaowei feels appreciation, connection) “I didn’t win mom. We got second place in a regular diamond-onyx tournament.” </p>

<p>This often happens in speeches, since the speaker has a lot of control of active topics. Below, Sam sets up his own hooks, which he then springboards off of for fitted humor attempts:</p> 


<p>Lina shushes everyone. The principal is about to come in! The drama team quiets as Sam enters the classroom.</p>

<p>Sam: “Hello everyone. I just wanted to stop by to say—congratulations! First place in regionals? For the first time in Panther history—wow!” *crowd smiles and murmurs to each other* (&larr;audience feels achievement) </p>

<p>“I also wanted to apologize for that mix-up with the auditorium scheduling, and that we were so slow in getting that fixed. I…” *laughs regretfully* (&larr;speaker feels reconciliation) “…take responsibility for that lapse in communication, and we’ll work to do better in the future. I’m afraid that that week we gave a bad name to school administrators everywhere—ahem, for the first time in history.” *audience laughs* (&larr;audience feels reconciliation) </p>

<p>“But you should know just how proud of you guys the entire school is, from Mrs. Jenson to Mrs. Gardener. *crowd smiles* (&larr;audience feels accomplishment)</p> 

<p>“Still, I have to say…” *earnestly* “…this is the best darn drama team in Pennsylvania. No, I mean that! I realized this when I went to a conference in Philly, and I talked about this group there. Did you know most schools only fund Drama Dream competitions when they have forty people signed up?” *audience murmurs and laughs in surprise* (&larr;audience feels revelation)</p> 

<p>“But everyone in this room stepped up to win, even with less than half that number. And that’s why everyone here deserves a round of applause.” *claps* *crowd claps and cheers* (&larr;audience feels accomplishment)</p> 

<p>“That’s why I’m so proud to announce a special honor for us today. The state director of Drama Dream herself has decided to stop by today and personally give the school the award—1st place in the third annual Drama Dream Comp!!” *director walks in, smiling* *crowd laughs in shock* (&larr;audience feels delight)</p> 

<p>When Sam creates and follows these hooks to make fitted humor attempts, his speech feels enjoyable, engaging, personal, meaningful, thoughtful, and so on. </p>
