    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor family words determine fittedness</h1>
    
<p>Topics are just one component of fittedness. We can also use <a href="../7chapter-humor-family-words/7-0-humor-family-words.html">humor family words</a> to think about the fittededness of humor attempts.</p>

 

<div class="listbox">
   <p class="listbox-headline">Humor family words</p>
    acceptance, accomplishment, apology, appreciation, belonging, comfort, connection, delight, forgiveness, generosity, humor, insight, joy, reconciliation, realization, release, revelation, relief, safety, success, surprise, welcome</div>


<p>Humor family words let us chunk apart the very broad question of <callback>“when does humor fit”</callback> into more answerable questions like <callback>“when would <emotions>acceptance</emotions> fit?”</callback>—or <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, or so on.</p> 

<p>For instance, sometimes Emma feels sadness at the same time as humor:</p>

 

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*red-eyed*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“What’s wrong, Em?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Nothing. I’ve just realized I’m older now than my brother was when h-he died…”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Aw. Emma.”</speech> <action>*hugs*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*cries*</action> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma has mixed emotional states with both sadness and humor)</notes></p> 

<p>We can use topics and humor family words to estimate fittedness:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li><strong>Topics.</strong> The humor is generated on relevant or recently active topics—Emma had been thinking about her brother, and Zoe gave Emma a hug in response.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Humor family words.</strong> We can describe Emma’s humor as related to experiences of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on.</li>
    </ul>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >
    
    <p>Zoe's humor attempt fit the situation—Emma’s humor fit too. Emma's humor was not odd or deserving of pushback.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We don’t usually think of hugs as humor attempts. But since Zoe was intending Emma to feel humor (<emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, and so on), Zoe’s hug was a humor attempt. It was a fitted humor attempt too—since it involved relevant topics and was intending Emma to feel humor family words.</p>
    </div>

<p>If Zoe just randomly hugs Emma out of the blue, the humor attempt would be less fitted. That's because even though Zoe still intended Emma to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, and so on—it wouldn't involve the same relevant or recently active topics.</p> 

<p>A hug would be even less fitted if Zoe hugged a random stranger. The topics involved would be even less relevant, and there would be less context to describe the intention as <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, and so on.</p>

 

 

<div class="box">
     <p><headline>Coexistence.</headline> Sometimes we think of humor as the opposite of sadness, in the sense that they can’t exist together. If we think this, it can be surprising to see sadness and humor together. But humor isn’t really the opposite of sadness, and they can be present simultaneously.</p>
      
    <p>A comparison would be how black is black and white is white—but without preventing us from having a black and white painting. Is the same how sadness is sadness and humor and humor, but there's nothing preventing them from being present simultaneously.</p>
    
    <p>Each topic generates any kind of emotion into our emotional state. Since we can have many topics active at once, there’s nothing particularly unusual about feeling humor and sadness simultaneously, or alternating between balanced emotions and mistake-predominant emotions.</p>
