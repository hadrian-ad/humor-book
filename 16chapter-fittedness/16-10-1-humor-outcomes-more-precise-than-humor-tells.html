    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor outcomes are more precise than humor tells</h1>
 
       <p>   
        When talking about fittedness, we won't use <term>humor tells</term> too much. In part, that's because it's more precise to think about <em>humor outcomes</em> instead. </p>

<p>When people bring up a lack of humor tells, they're often just using them as a proxy for a lack of movement toward humor outcomes:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>The manager wanted Jessica to smile <callback>(because the manager wanted Jessica to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> with customers)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Jessica wanted her manager to smile <callback>(because she wanted Marie to <humor-outcome>change negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Trevor wanted Minh to lighten up <callback>(because he wanted Minh to <humor-outcome>ease</humor-outcome> (his own) <humor-outcome>tension</humor-outcome>)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Sabrina thought Artem should seem less serious <callback>(in order to better help him <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome> with potential matches)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Emma wanted Max to relax (<callback>in order to <humor-outcome>become less defensive</humor-outcome></callback>).</li> 
    </ul>
    

    <p>If Jessica can <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> <outcome-contrast>without</outcome-contrast> smiling, the manager doesn't have much reason to care that Jessica isn't <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>. Focusing on the lack of smiling would be confusing the means for the ends!</p> 
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">More generally, <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome> is always the the goal <sem>everywhere</sem>. A thousand years ago strangers everywhere wanted to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> when they arrive for a party&mdash;just like they do today.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext"><humor-outcome>Creating rapport</humor-outcome> was a goal that hasn't varied, even if the goal of which humor tells when has varied person-by-person, place-by-place, time-by-time.</p>
