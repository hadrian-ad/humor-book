    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can use humor family words as hooks for fitted humor</h1>
    

<p>When we have the opportunity to help someone feel a humor family word, we have a <vocab>hook</vocab> where we can make a fitted humor attempt.</p> 

<p>We come across explicit and implicit hooks all the time:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>when someone shares a success, we can try to help them feel <emotions>achievement</emotions></li>
    <li>when someone is uncomfortable we can try to make them <emotions>comfort</emotions></li>
    <li>when someone is confused, we can try to make them feel <emotions>insight</emotions></li>
    <li>when someone is frustrated with us, we can try to mutually feel <emotions>reconciliation</emotions></li>
    <li>when someone is nervous, we can try to make them feel <emotions>safety</emotions></li>
    <li>when someone feels joy, we can try to make them feel more <emotions>joy</emotions></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>If these humor attempts are successful, we help them feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, and so on—and they’ll express humor tells:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*checks phone*</action> <speech>“Holy shit. My paper got accepted for that conference!”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma shares an achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help her feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>)</notes></p>

<p>At first, it can be hard to notice these hooks. But with practice, we increasingly improve our ability to flow into fitted humor attempts.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Fittedness is about relevancy. Hooks are practical ways of seeing relevancy in a situation. Fitted humor attempts build or iterate upon that relevancy.</p> </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Catching.</headline> Sometimes hooks seem to be offered <term>explicitly</term>, like if someone wants to be congratulated <callback>(“I beat barbaric nightmare difficulty!”)</callback>—while other times they seem to exist <em>implicitly</em> <callback>(Sam is examining his balding head)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p>In either case, hooks can sometimes be hard to catch:</p> 
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*mouth suddenly dry*</action> <speech>“So… I weighed myself the other day. I’ve lost ten pounds.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor shares an achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help him feel <emotions>achievement</emotions>)</notes></p>
        <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <speech>“Oh?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh is unsure how to take Trevor’s comment)</notes></p>
        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*embarrassed*</action> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor stops offering hook)</notes></p>
    </div> 
    
    <p>Trevor was trying to offer a hook, but didn’t contextualize it enough for Minh—since Minh wasn’t certain what Trevor was looking for.</p> 
    
    <p>In this case, there was trouble from both ends—<term>Trevor</term> didn't explicitly offer enough of a hook at the same time <em>Minh</em> didn't have enough practice spotting implicit hooks.</p>
