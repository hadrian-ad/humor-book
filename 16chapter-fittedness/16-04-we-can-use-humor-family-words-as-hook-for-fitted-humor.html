           <p class="overtitle">Using Fittedness</p>
</h1>
       
</div>
     

<p>In this chapter, we'll continue looking at fittedness&mdash;and how fittedness can help us act or understand situations.</p> 

<p>In particular, elements of fittedness can be used as <vocab>hooks</vocab> that lead us to fitted humor attempts. If someone says they're thirsty, we can offer them water&mdash;in the samy way, if someone:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>shares a success&mdash;we can try to help them feel <emotions>achievement</emotions></li>
    <li>is uncomfortable&mdash;we can try to make them <emotions>comfort</emotions></li>
    <li>is confused&mdash;we can try to make them feel <emotions>insight</emotions></li>
    <li>is frustrated with us&mdash;we can try to mutually feel <emotions>reconciliation</emotions></li>
    <li>is nervous&mdash;we can try to make them feel <emotions>safety</emotions></li>
    <li>feels joy&mdash;we can try to make them feel more <emotions>joy</emotions></li>
    </ul>
