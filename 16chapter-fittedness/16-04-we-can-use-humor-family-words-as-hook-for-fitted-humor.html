<p>When we can help someone feel a humor family word, we have a “hook” where we can make a fitted humor attempt.</p> 

<p>We come across explicit and implicit hooks all the time:</p>

when someone shares a success, we can try to help them feel achievement
when someone is uncomfortable we can try to make them comfort
when someone is confused, we can try to make them feel insight
when someone is frustrated with us, we can try to mutually feel reconciliation
when someone is nervous, we can try to make them feel safety
when someone feels joy, we can try to make them feel more joy

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>If these humor attempts are successful, we help them feel achievement, comfort, insight, and so on—and they’ll express humor tells:</p>

 

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*checks phone*</action> <speech>“Holy shit. My paper got accepted for that conference!”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Emma shares an achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help her feel achievement)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <internalaction>(excited)</internalaction> <speech>“Really?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“That’s great, Em! Congratulations!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jessica tries to help Emma continue to feel achievement)</notes></p>

 

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <internalaction>(nonchalantly)</internalaction> <speech>“By the way, I finished StormConQuest on Barbaric Nightmare difficulty.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor shares an achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help him feel achievement)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <internalaction>(delighted)</internalaction> <speech>“No way! I thought you’d never do it! How’d you beat the last mission?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin tries to help Trevor continue to feel achievement)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels achievement) <internalaction>(happily)</internalaction></notes> <speech>“The final defense was insane! So I just spammed kobold landmines.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action></p>

 

<p><narration>Yasmin goes to the bathroom, leaving Trevor sitting awkwardly at the table with her parents and siblings. There’s an awkward pause.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels nervous&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help him feel welcome)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Yasmin's mother:</speaker> <action>*gets up*</action> <speech>“Want some tea, pop, water?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother tries to help Trevor feel welcome)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*shakes head*</action> <speech>“No thank you, I’m good.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor attempt is unsuccessful)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> <speech>“No really, you’d make me feel happy to get you something. What would you like?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother continues humor attempt)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Well, I guess I wouldn’t mind some soda.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor feels welcome)</notes></p>

 

<p><speaker>Riley:</speaker> <action>*upset*</action> <speech>“Mom? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to break it. Maybe I can make a new one.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Riley feels division&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help her feel reconciliation)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <speech>“Aw Riley. It’s okay.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer tries to help Riley feel reconciliation)</notes> <action>*hugs her*</action> <speech>“Let’s just be more careful next time, okay?”</speech></p>

 

<p><narration>Sam is examining his balding head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam feels uncertainty about change&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help him feel acceptance, belonging)</notes></p>

<p>
<narration>Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</narration>
</p>

<p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*squeezing him*</action> <speech>“You look so handsome.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer tries to help Sam feel acceptance and belonging)</notes></p> 

<p><narration>Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately.</narration></p> 


<p>At first, it can be hard to notice these hooks for fitted humor attempts. But we increasingly improve with practice, and eventually the situation guides us to specific humor attempts.</p>


 

<p>Catching. We can either be offered hooks explicitly, like if someone wants to be congratulated (“I beat barbaric nightmare difficulty!”)—or we can observe the hooks implicitly (Sam is examining his balding head).</p> 

<p>Sometimes, these hooks can be hard to catch:</p> 

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*mouth suddenly dry*</action> <speech>“So… I weighed myself the other day. I’ve lost ten pounds.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor shares an achievement&harr;&#xFE0E;hook to help him feel achievement)</notes></p>
<p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <speech>“Oh?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Minh is unsure how to take Trevor’s comment)</notes></p>
<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*embarrassed*</action> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor abandons hook)</notes></p> 

<p>Trevor was trying to offer a hook, but didn’t contextualize it enough for Minh—since Minh wasn’t certain what Trevor wanted. In this case, both ends were lacking—Trevor didn't offer enough of a hook at the same time Minh didn't have enough practice extrapolating hooks.</p>
