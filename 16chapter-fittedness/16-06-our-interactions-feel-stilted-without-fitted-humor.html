<p>When Sam <sem>doesn’t</sem> set up or follow-up on hooks, his speech will feel clunky and unfitted:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Lina shushes everyone. The principle is about to come in! The drama team quiets as Sam enters the classroom.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <speech>“Whoa! What happened to the colors in this room?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Who approved this? Hope it wasn’t me.”</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor attempt isn’t based on any hook to make audience feel humor family words)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><speech>“Anyway, I’m stopping by because you all scored pretty well at regionals. Sorry you guys were so upset about that mix-up earlier, but we have a lot more important things on our plate.”</speech> <action>*audience is quiet*</action> <speech>“I had the privilege of going to a conference in Philly, big hoopla, and I…”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“…realized I don’t do well on more than five cups of coffee, hoo boy…”</speech> <action>*crowd chuckles politely*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor attempt was on hook for himself, not on the audience)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><speech>“Anyway, I realized that you competed with less people than other schools, which was news to me. I’m not sure why she’s here exactly, but I’ll let her explain that—someone from Drama Dream, LLC is here, so let’s give her a hand.”</speech> <action>*crowd claps politely*</action></p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>The reason Sam's audience finds this speech distasteful, inelegant, ineffective, toned-deaf, and so on is the absence of fitted humor. Sam comes across hooks for humor family words, but doesn’t follow them.</p> 

<p>Sam still expresses humor tells himself and makes humor attempts <callback>(“I don’t do well on more than five cups of coffee…”)</callback>—but without other fitted humor attempts, this speech comes off as worse than the other.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes, the <term>presence</term> of humor attempts are <em>unfitted</em>, like when Sam talks about the paint color of the room—but other times the <term>absence</term> of humor attempts are <em>unfitted</em>, like when Sam doesn’t properly congratulate the team.</p> 
    </div>

<p>Sam’s speech had greater impact on his audience when he created and followed hooks&mdash;and made humor attempts that fit the situation.</p>
