<p>In this chapter, we’ll be looking at when and why humor is “appropriate.”</p> 

<p>Specifically, we’ll be looking at when and why humor gets pushback:</p>

<p>Owen’s chemistry report is returned to him. The professor had circled the title “O carbon, my carbon!” in red pen and took off five points. (&larr;Owen’s humor attempt is seen as inappropriate)</p>



<p>Hana shares a meme that makes what she sees as humorous absurdist points about another country’s aggression. Her thesis advisor tells her to be careful. (&larr;Hana’s association with humor attempt is seen as inappropriate)</p>



<p>Jessica: *coming in* “Did you hear Carl’s mom died?!”</p>

<p>Emma: “What, Mary? Oh my god.” *laughs*</p>

<p>Jessica: “Emma! You can’t laugh at that!” (&larr;Jessica sees Emma’s humor as inappropriate)</p>

<p>Emma: (Distressed) “I’m not laughing! That’s just terrible.”</p>



<p>Sabrina is arguing with herself about whether levity in a cover letter is appropriate. It seems impossible to her that an employer wouldn’t value a sense of humor in an employee. Eventually, she bows to conventional wisdom and deletes the funny phrase. (&larr;Sabrina struggles to figure out the appropriateness of humor attempts)</p>



<p>Riley can’t stop making poop jokes and laughs gleefully each time. Sam yells at her to knock it off. (&larr;Sam sees Riley’s humor as inappropriate)</p>



<p>Elias is annoyed that his favorite podcaster keeps getting pushback from the media for making jokes. They’re just jokes! (&larr;Elias feels something is unfairly or nonsensically seen as inappropriate)</p>



<p>Trevor makes a joke about headscarves at his lab, and Hana and John get offended. Trevor gets annoyed. “Lighten up guys!” he says. “My girlfriend wears a hijab. I’m pretty sure I know what’s appropriate or not!” His lab mates shake their heads knowingly at Trevor’s crudeness and insensitivity.</p>

<p>Trevor is in a bad mood the rest of the day. (&larr;Trevor disagrees with what his lab sees as inappropriate)</p>



<p>We’ll be talking about the appropriateness of humor throughout this chapter.</p>
