<p>When talking about when and why humor receives pushback, we’ll avoid the word “appropriate.” We’ll use the word “fit” instead.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">This lets us change our question from “when is humor appropriate?” into “when does humor fit?”</p> 

<p>We use "fittedness" all the time. If we walk around our yard to see where a vegetable garden could go, we’d notice a garden would fit better in some parts of our yard than others.</p> 

<p>We can notice this because of things like: </p>

access to water sources
elevation
closeness to the house
protection from wind
qualities of soil
sunlight
what we want to grow
(and so on) 

<p>We’d add up these factors to measure degrees of fittedness: </p>

 

<p>This is easy to do for gardens, since we already have ideas about what contributes to garden-fittedness, like sunlight and water. We can do the same thing with humor too!</p> 

<p>We can find degrees of fittedness in humor or humor attempts by using topics, intensity, humor family words, humor tells, humor outcomes, and so on:</p> 



 

 

<p>Morality. We often talk about the "appropriateness” of humor in our day-to-day conversations. Appropriateness sometimes means something like "fittedness"—but it also sometimes means something about morality or etiquette systems. (“It’s inappropriate to chew with your mouth open.”) But we won’t need morality or etiquette to talk about how people react to humor.</p>
 
<p>If we scatter seeds across a yard, some seeds will take better in some parts of the yard than others. It’s not that some seeds had better morality or etiquette than other seeds (“appropriateness”)—instead, some seeds do better because the conditions were just better for those particular seeds than others (“fittedness”). We can do something similar with humor.</p>
