<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor can fit a situation</h1>
    
   

<p>When talking about when and why humor receives pushback, we’ll avoid the word “appropriate.” We’ll use the word <vocab>fit</vocab> instead.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This lets us change our question from <callback>“when is humor appropriate?”</callback> into <callback>“when does humor fit?”</callback></p> 
    </div>
    
<p>We use "fittedness" all the time. If we walk around our yard to see where a vegetable garden could go, we’d notice a garden would fit better in some parts of our yard than others.</p> 

<p>We can notice this because of things like: </p>

<ul>
   <li>access to water sources</li>
    <li>elevation</li>
    <li>closeness to the house</li>
    <li>protection from wind</li>
    <li>qualities of soil</li>
    <li>sunlight</li>
    <li>what we want to grow</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>We’d add up these factors to measure degrees of fittedness: </p>

 

<p>This is easy to do for gardens, since we already have ideas about what contributes to garden-fittedness, like sunlight and water. We can do the same thing with humor too!</p> 

<p>We can find degrees of fittedness in humor or humor attempts by using topics, intensity, humor family words, humor tells, humor outcomes, and so on:</p> 



 

 

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Morality.</headline> We often talk about the <term>appropriateness</term> of humor in our day-to-day conversations. Appropriateness sometimes means something like <em>fittedness</em>—but it <em>also</em> sometimes means something about morality or etiquette systems. <callback>(“It’s inappropriate to chew with your mouth open.”)</callback> But we won’t need morality or etiquette to talk about how people react to humor.</p>
     
    <p>If we scatter seeds across a yard, some seeds will take better in some parts of the yard than others. It’s not that some seeds had better morality or etiquette than other seeds <callback>(“appropriateness”)</callback>—instead, some seeds do better because the conditions were just better for those particular seeds than others <callback>(“fittedness”)</callback>. We can do something similar with humor.</p>
