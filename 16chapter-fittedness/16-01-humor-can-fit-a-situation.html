<h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor can fit a situation</h1>
    
   

<p>In this book, we'll avoid word “appropriate” and use the word <vocab>fit</vocab> instead.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This lets us change our question from <callback>“when is humor appropriate?”</callback> into <callback>“when does humor fit?”</callback></p> 
    </div>
    
<p>We already use "fittedness" all the time. If we walk around our yard to see where a vegetable garden could go, we’d notice reasons a garden would fit in some parts of our yard better than others, like:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>access to water sources</li>
    <li>elevation</li>
    <li>closeness to the house</li>
    <li>protection from wind</li>
    <li>qualities of soil</li>
    <li>sunlight</li>
    <li>what we want to grow</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>We’d add up these factors to measure degrees of fittedness: </p>

     >

 

<p>This is easy to do for <term>gardens</term>, since we already have ideas about what contributes to garden-fittedness, like sunlight and water. But we can do the same thing with <em>humor</em> too!</p> 

<p>We can find degrees of fittedness in humor or humor attempts by using topics, intensity, humor family words, humor tells, humor outcomes, and so on:</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Morality.</headline> In our day-to-day conversations we often use the word "appropriate" when talking about humor. Appropriateness <term>sometimes</term> means something like fittedness—but it <em>also</em> sometimes  means something about morality or etiquette systems. <callback>(“It’s inappropriate to chew with your mouth open.”)</callback></p> 
    
    <p>Since we we won’t need morality or etiquette to talk about how people react to humor, we'll set aside the word appropriate for now in favor of the more neutral word fit.</p>
     
    <p>If we scatter seeds across a yard, some seeds will take better in some parts of the yard than others. It’s not that some seeds had better morality or etiquette than other seeds <callback>(“appropriateness”)</callback>—instead, some seeds do better because the conditions were just better for those particular seeds than others <callback>(“fittedness”)</callback>. We can do something similar with humor.</p>
