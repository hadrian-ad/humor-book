<p>In addition to topics and humor family words, humor outcomes also contribute to fittedness.</p>

 

Humor outcomes
acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, make a point, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.
Humor outcomes help us frame questions about fittedness with narrative clarity.


<p>Instead of asking “when does humor fit?” we can ask more tangible questions like: “when does avoid conflict fit?”—or handle a complaint, reduce defensiveness, symbolize close ties, and so on.</p>

 

<p><narration>Justin’s walking out of the English department when Dave catches him.</narration></p>

<p>Dave: *smiling* “Justin! The department’s going to get some drinks tonight. You should come!”</p>

<p>Justin: *shaking head* *smiling* Thanks, but I’d better pass. The mountain of sobriety, you know, Tantalus and Sisyphus. Maybe another event!” (&larr;Justin reveals a personality trait)</p>

<p>Dave: *laughs* “Sure, I get it. Maybe another time, another event then!”</p>

<p>In this example, Justin wants to reveal a personality trait that he’s sober. Since revealing a personality trait is something that humor can do, this is an instance where humor attempts may be fitted:</p> 

 

<p>But revealing a personal trait isn’t the only humor outcome in this example—Justin’s humor attempt also tries to avoid conflict (while declining an invitation), deal with a taboo topic (alcoholism), support an argument (that he has a valid excuse to decline), and so on.</p>



<p>By comparison, if Justin makes a funny voice and goes “NOOOooooOO… thank you,” this humor attempt wouldn’t be as strongly described as dealing with taboo topics or avoiding conflict—and so would be less fitted.</p>


<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">Dave’s humor in response to Justin’s humor attempt is also fitted. (*laughs* "sure, I get it.") Dave wasn’t laughing at content, like alcoholism—he was laughing because he reached humor outcomes. He felt an argument was supported, he gained a new perspective, he feels Justin revealed a personality trait, he feels rapport has been created, and so on.</p> 


<p>The more fitted humor attempts are, the more informationally dense and multipurpose they are. This means fitted humor starts doing things that can't be done as efficiently any other way.</p>

<p>This efficiency is part of what makes others see humor as fitted:</p>

 

<p><narration>Carl picks up his sister Sara at the bus station for the funeral. They drive in silence. Finally, Carl says profoundly:</narration> “Elias says the world is a place we prove real by dying in it.”</p> 

<p><narration>Sara thinks about that.</narration> </p>

<p><narration>Then Carl grins:</narration> “What an asshole!”</p>

<p><narration>Sara laughs.</narration> (&larr;Carl and Sara have achieved catharsis, eased tension, reduced defensiveness, avoided conflict, created rapport, opened up a new topic of conversation, dealt with taboo topics)</p> 

 

 

<p>Trevor: *shopping online* “Should we order it or not?”</p>

<p>Yasmin: “I just can’t decide! I just love StormConQuest, but the reviews on the expansion are just so mixed. They say StormConQuest: Seas of Drake and Myrrh really simplifies the resource management. What if that ruins it?”</p>

<p>Trevor: *out of the blue* “What do you think about having a kid?” (&larr;Trevor wants to use humor to open a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personal view, deal with a taboo topic)</p>

<p>Yasmin: *laughs* “Oh god, Trevor.” (&larr;Yasmin’s laugh shows a new topic has been opened, that she’s dealing with a taboo topic, is easing tensions, revealing a personal view)</p>

 



<p>There isn't another way to do as much as efficiently. This makes the humor attempts seem fitted.</p>
