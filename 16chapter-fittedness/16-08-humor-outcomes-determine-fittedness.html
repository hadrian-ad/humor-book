    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor outcomes determine fittedness</h1>
    
   
  
<p>In addition to topics and humor family words, <a href="../14chapter-humor-outcomes/14-0-humor-outcomes.html">humor outcomes</a> also contribute to fittedness.</p>


<div class="listbox">
   <p class="listbox-headline">Humor outcomes</p>
    <p><i>acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, make a point, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</i></p>
    </div>
    
<p>Humor outcomes help us frame questions about fittedness with narrative clarity.</p>


<p>Instead of asking <callback>“when does humor fit?”</callback> we can ask more tangible questions—like <callback>“when does <humor-outcome>avoiding conflict</humor-outcome> fit?”</callback> or <humor-outcome>handling a complaint</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reducing defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolizing close ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Justin’s walking out of the English department when Dave catches him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Justin! The department’s going to get some drinks tonight. You should come!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*shaking head*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>"Thanks, but I’d better pass. The mountain of sobriety, you know, Tantalus and Sisyphus. Maybe another event!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin reveals a personality trait)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Sure, I get it. Maybe another time, another event then!”</speech></p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>In this example, Justin wants to <humor-outcome>reveal a personality trait</humor-outcome> that he’s sober. Since <humor-outcome>revealing a personality trait</humor-outcome> is something that humor can do, this is an instance where humor attempts may be fitted:</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
 

<p>But <humor-outcome>revealing a personal trait</humor-outcome> isn’t the only humor outcome in this example—Justin’s humor attempt also tries to <humor-outcome>avoid conflict (while declining an invitation)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with a taboo topic (alcoholism)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support an argument (that he has a valid excuse to decline)</humor-outcome>, and so on:</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width:20rem ; margin-left: " 
     >



<p>By comparison, if Justin makes a funny voice and goes <callback>“NOOOooooOO… thank you,”</callback> this humor attempt wouldn’t be as strongly described as <humor-outcome>dealing with taboo topics</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>avoiding conflict</humor-outcome>—and so would be less fitted.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Dave’s humor in response to Justin’s humor attempt is also fitted. <callback>(*laughs* "sure, I get it.")</callback> Dave wasn’t laughing at <term>content</term>, like alcoholism—Dave was laughing because he reached <em>humor outcomes</em>.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Dave felt an <humor-outcome>argument was supported</humor-outcome>, he<humor-outcome> gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, he feels <humor-outcome>Justin revealed a personality trait</humor-outcome>, he feels <humor-outcome>rapport has been created</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>The more fitted a humor attempt is, the more informationally dense and multipurpose it is. This means fitted humor starts doing things that can't be done as efficiently any other way.</p>

<p>This efficiency is part of what makes others see humor as fitted:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Carl picks up his sister Sara at the bus station for the funeral. They drive in silence. Finally, Carl says profoundly:</narration> <speech>“Elias says the world is a place we prove real by dying in it.”</speech></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Sara thinks about that.</narration> </p>
    
    <p><narration>Then Carl grins:</narration> <speech>“What an asshole!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>Sara laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Carl and Sara have achieved catharsis, eased tension, reduced defensiveness, avoided conflict, created rapport, opened up a new topic of conversation, dealt with taboo topics)</notes></p>

    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <speech>“I just can’t decide! I just love StormConQuest, but the reviews on the expansion are just so mixed. They say StormConQuest: Seas of Drake and Myrrh really simplifies the resource management. What if that ruins it?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*out of the blue*</action> <speech>“What do you think about having a kid?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor wants to use humor to open a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personal view, deal with a taboo topic)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Oh god, Trevor.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s laugh shows a new topic has been opened, that she’s dealing with a taboo topic, is easing tensions, revealing a personal view)</notes></p>

<p>Since isn't an alternative to humor to do as much as efficiently here, the humor attempts are seen by others as fitted.</p>
