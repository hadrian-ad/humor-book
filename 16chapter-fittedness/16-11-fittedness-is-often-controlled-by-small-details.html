<p>Small details can make a substantial difference in how fitted a humor attempt is. We can look at this with some contrasting examples:</p> 

<p>Sam: *to drama team* “I remember when I was cast as the slug in my fifth-grade play about compost…” *crowd chuckles* (&larr;anecdote is mostly irrelevant to drama team)</p>

<p class="vig-or">- OR -</p>

 <p>Sam: *to drama team* “You guys are lucky you have so much talent—I remember when I was cast as the slug in our fifth-grade play about compost…” *crowd laughs* (&larr;anecdote is framed in a way that’s more relevant to drama team)</p>

 

 

<p>Above, a small prelude (“you guys are so lucky”) sets up a comparison that helps his audience feel humor family words—which gives Sam’s comment greater topical relevance and fittedness.</p> 

<p>We can use a quantification metaphor to graph the difference in fittedness:</p> 

 

<p>Small changes can make a large difference in fittedness. Even though these changes can seem like minor things, people carefully pick up on them.</p>

 

<p>Differences. A "small difference" isn't the same thing as "unimportant difference." This is obvious with screws. When we need to be precise, a millimeter of difference is the difference between something working and something not working. It's the same for humor, where a word or small inflection is the difference between something being fitted and something being unfitted.</p>

<p>One of the ways we improve at our humor skills is by gaining a greater ability to calibrate to these small differences—since these small differences are often the controlling factor in what's fitted or not.</p> 

<p>Like any skill, these small details can seem finicky and hard to manage at first. They can also seem uniquely finicky, but it's actually no more or less finicky than everything else—from screws, music rhythms, proper spelling, matching paint colors, and so on. Like every skill, the "finickiness" slowly disappears as it increasingly becomes incorporated into our intuitive work within complicated systems.</p>
