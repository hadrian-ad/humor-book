<p>Small details can make a big difference in how fitted a humor attempt is:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*to drama team*</action> <speech>“I remember when I was cast as the slug in my fifth-grade play about compost…”</speech> <action>*crowd chuckles*</action> <notes>(&larr;anecdote is mostly irrelevant to drama team)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
     <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*to drama team*</action> <speech>“You guys are lucky you have so much talent—I remember when I was cast as the slug in our fifth-grade play about compost…”</speech> <action>*crowd laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;anecdote is framed in a way that’s more relevant to drama team)</notes></p>

<p>Above, a small prelude <callback>(“you guys are so lucky”)</callback> sets up a comparison that helps Sam's audience feel humor family words—which gives Sam’s comment greater topical relevance and fittedness.</p> 

<p>We can use a quantification metaphor to graph the difference in fittedness:</p>

<p>Small differences in presentation can make a large difference in fittedness.</p>

 

<div class="box"><p><headline>Differences.</headline> A <term>small</term> difference isn't the same thing as an <em>unimportant</em> difference. This is obvious with screws. When we need to be precise, a millimeter of difference is the difference between something working and something not working.</p> 
   
   <p>It's the same for fittedness, where a word or small inflection is the difference between something being fitted and something being unfitted&mdash;the "millimeter" adjustments that determine whether a humor attempt fits or not.</p>
    
    <p>These small differences are often the controlling factor in what's fitted or not. These small details can seem finicky and hard to manage at first. But they're not <sem>uniquely</sem> finicky&mdash;it's actually no more or less finicky than everything else. We work under the neccessity for small details in screws, music rhythms, proper spelling, pronuciation, matching paint colors, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>Like every skill, the "finickiness" slowly disappears as it increasingly becomes naturalized into our intuitive understanding within complicated systems.</p>
