    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor tells determine fittedness</h1>
    

<p>We can also think about fittedness with <a href="../8chapter-humor-tell/8-0-humor-tells.html">humor tells</a>.</p> 

humor tells
brightening, energy, expansive posture, eyes twinkling, flushing, higher speaking register, informal posture, informal movement, laughter, loosening, reduction of physical tension, relaxed posture, smiling, touching others, touching self, efforts to spread humor, fast thinking, fast speaking, focusing on present, high energy, increased agency, loss of situational awareness, non-normative behavior, optimism, raised spirits, reduction of stress, social integration, social seeking, social tightening.


<p>Instead of asking “where does humor fit?”, we can ask: <callback>“where does <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell> fit? Where does it not fit?”</callback>—and we can ask the same of <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
   
<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We instinctively know it wouldn’t be fitted for Sam to play wrestle with the director of Drama Dream when she comes on stage—since that would be a moment where <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell> would be unfitted.</p> 
    </div>

<p>When there’s disagreement over where humor is “appropriate,” the disagreement isn’t always about the <term>general</term> idea of humor—it’s often about <em>specific</em> humor tells.</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>The restaurant is having a slow Tuesday, so Jessica is having some fun back-and-forth with the staff as she goes in and out of the kitchen. They’re laughing about elephants—the manager overhears this but doesn’t care. Jessica approaches each table smiling and cheerful.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the manager decides that humor tells like optimism, smiling, and raised spirits fit the circumstances)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>The restaurant is having a slow Tuesday, so Jessica has some fun back-and-forth with the staff as she goes in and out of the kitchen. Over time, their jokes get more complicated, and soon they start putting their arms to their faces like elephant trunks, making elephant trumpets, doubling over with laugher, and they miss someone waiting to be seated. The manager raps on the door. “Ladies!” she says.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the manager decides that humor tells like loss of situational awareness, non-normative behavior, raised voices, and laughter do not fit the circumstances)</notes></p> 
</div>
    
    <p>In the examples above, the manager feels that optimism, smiling, raised spirits and so on fit the situation—while loss of situational awareness, non-normative behavior, and so on don’t, since they get in the way of the restaurant’s goals.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We’re not looking at whether the manager is right or wrong. Instead, we’re seeing how our thinking becomes more tangible when we shift away from something abstract, like “humor,” and focus on something more specific, like individual humor tells.</p> 
</div>
    
    <p class="considertext">Finally, humor tells often help us avoid over-emphasizing content as something that determines what fits or not. In the example above, the manager wasn't concerned about content—but about the intensity of some humor tells.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Imbalances.</headline> Since managers and employees have power imbalances and often unaligned goals, it can seem strange to use them in an example of fittedness. It seems like neither side would necessarily agree with the other.</p> 
    
    <p>But something similar happens whenever there’s an organized effort, whether or not it involves formal rankings. We struggle to balance humor tells with our goals whenever we’re:</p> 
<ul class="close-list">    
            <li>studying with friends for a test</li>
            <li>trying to beat a tough co-op game</li>
            <li>doing yard work with siblings</li>
            <li>trying to practice a presentation with our partner</li>
            <li>having a serious discussion about finances with our friend</li>
            <li>picking up litter at a watershed</li>
            </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p>There can be disagreements about humor even in these cases where there aren't formal rankings. But as before, the struggle isn’t over the fittedness of "humor" <term>in general</term>—but about the fittedness of <em>humor tells</em> specifically.</p> 
    
    <p>For instance, humor is often fitted when studying together—even though some specific humor tells, like constant giggling or shoving, aren't. In these cases, it's not usually the <term>content</term> that matters as much as the <em>humor tells</em> themselves—it's the constant giggling that doesn't fit the situation.</p>
