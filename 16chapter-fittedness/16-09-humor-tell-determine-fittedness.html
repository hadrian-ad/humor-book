    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor tells determine fittedness</h1>
    

<p>We can also think about fittedness with <a href="../8chapter-humor-tell/8-0-humor-tells.html">humor tells</a>.</p> 

<div class="listbox">
   <p class="listbox-headline">Humor tells</p>
<p><i>brightening, energy, expansive posture, eyes twinkling, flushing, higher speaking register, informal posture, informal movement, laughter, loosening, reduction of physical tension, relaxed posture, smiling, touching others, touching self, efforts to spread humor, fast thinking, fast speaking, focusing on present, high energy, increased agency, loss of situational awareness, non-normative behavior, optimism, raised spirits, reduction of stress, social integration, social seeking, social tightening.</i></p>
    </div>

<p>Instead of asking “where does humor fit?”, we can ask: <callback>“where does <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell> fit? Where does <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell> <sem>not</sem> fit?”</callback> We can ask the same of <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
   
<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We intuitively know it wouldn’t be fitted for Sam to play wrestle with the director of Drama Dream when she comes on stage—since that would be a moment where <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell> would be unfitted.</p> 
    </div>

<p>When there’s disagreement over where humor is “appropriate,” the disagreement isn’t always about the <term>general</term> idea of humor—it’s often about <em>specific</em> humor tells:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>The restaurant is having a slow Tuesday, so Jessica is having some fun back-and-forth with the staff as she goes in and out of the kitchen. They’re laughing about elephants—the manager overhears this but doesn’t care. Jessica approaches each table smiling and cheerful.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the manager decides that humor tells like <humor-tell>optimism</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell> fit the circumstances)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>The restaurant is having a slow Tuesday, so Jessica has some fun back-and-forth with the staff as she goes in and out of the kitchen. Over time, their jokes get more complicated, and soon they start putting their arms to their faces like elephant trunks, making elephant trumpets, doubling over with laugher, and they miss someone waiting to be seated.</narration></p> 
    
    <p>
        <narration>The manager raps on the door.</narration> <speech>“Ladies!”</speech> <narration>she says.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the manager decides that humor tells like <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raised voices</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell> do <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> fit the circumstances)</notes>
    </p> 
</div>
    
    <p>In the examples above, the manager feels that <humor-tell>optimism</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell> and so on <term>fit</term> the situation—while <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, and so on <em>don’t</em> fit, since they get in the way of the restaurant’s goals.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The point here isn't to decide whether the manager is right or wrong. Instead, the point is to see how our thinking becomes more tangible when we shift <term>away</term> from something abstract, like “humor,” and <em>toward</em> something more specific, like individual humor tells.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Finally, humor tells often help us avoid over-emphasizing <sem>content</sem> as something that determines what fits or not. In the example above, the manager wasn't concerned about <term>content</term>, but the <em>intensity</em> of some humor tells.</p>
</div>
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Imbalances.</headline> Since managers and employees have power imbalances and often unaligned goals, it can seem strange to use them in an example of fittedness. Different groups of people might not share the same perspective.</p> 
    
    <p>But something similar happens whenever there’s an organized effort&mdash;whether or not it involves formal rankings. We struggle to balance humor tells with our goals when we’re:</p> 
<ul class="close-list">    
            <li>studying with friends for a test</li>
            <li>trying to beat a tough co-op game</li>
            <li>doing yard work with siblings</li>
            <li>trying to practice a presentation with our partner</li>
            <li>having a serious discussion about finances with our friend</li>
            <li>picking up litter at a watershed</li>
            </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p>There can be disagreements about humor even in these cases where there aren't formal rankings. But as before, the struggle isn’t over the fittedness of "humor" or "content" in <term>general</term>—but about the fittedness of <sem>humor tells</sem> <em>specifically</em>.</p> 
    
    <p>For instance, <sem-weak>humor</sem-weak> is often fitted when studying together, even though some specific <sem-weak>humor <outcome-contrast>tells</outcome-contrast></sem-weak> aren't&mdash;like how broad <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> are okay when studying, but constant <humor-tell>giggling</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>shoving</humor-tell> aren't.</p> 
     
     <p>In these cases, it's not usually the <term>content</term> or <term>humor</term> that doesn't fit the situation so much as a particular <em>humor tell</em> that doesn't fit. <callback>(Constant <humor-tell>giggling</humor-tell>)</callback>.</p>
