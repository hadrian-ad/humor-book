<p>The relevance of a topic depends on who we’re talking to:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam is talking to the drama team.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> “I had the privilege of going to a conference in Philly, big hoopla, and I…” *laughs* “…realized I don’t do well on more than five cups of coffee, hoo boy…”</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Crowd:</speaker> *chuckles politely* (&larr;topic isn’t relevant to drama team)</p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>Sam is talking to Jennifer:</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughing*</action> <speech>“Jen, at the conference at Philly, I realized I don’t do well on more than five cups of coffee.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <internalaction>(amused)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh no. Fidget-y or pee-y-wise?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <internalaction>(realizing)</internalaction> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Wow, I don’t want to bore you with a random story…”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam worries his humor is on an irrelevant topic)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <internalaction>(earnestly)</internalaction> <speech>“No, tell me!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer feels topics about Sam are relevant to her)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
<p>When Sam tells the <term>drama team</term> about his coffee adventures in Philadelphia, he’s trying to make them feel <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, and so on—but the irrelevance of the topic keeps this humor attempt from being particularly fitted.</p> 

<p>By contrast, when Sam tells <em>
    Jennifer</em> about his coffee adventures, the topic is more relevant—since the closer people are to each other, the more topics that relate to one relate to the other.</p>
