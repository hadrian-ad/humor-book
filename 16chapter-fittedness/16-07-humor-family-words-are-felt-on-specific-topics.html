<p>The relevance of a topic depends on who we’re talking to:</p> 

<p>Sam is talking to the drama team.</p>

<p>Sam: “I had the privilege of going to a conference in Philly, big hoopla, and I…” *laughs* “…realized I don’t do well on more than five cups of coffee, hoo boy…”</p>

<p>Crowd: *chuckles politely* (&larr;topic isn’t relevant to drama team)</p>

<div class="vig-or">- OR -</div>

<p>Sam is talking to Jennifer:</p>

<p>Sam: *laughing* “Jen, at the conference at Philly, I realized I don’t do well on more than five cups of coffee.”</p>

<p>Jennifer: (amused) “Oh no. Fidget-y or pee-y-wise?”</p>

<p>Sam: (realizing) *laughs* “Wow, I don’t want to bore you with a random story…” (&larr;Sam worries his humor is on an irrelevant topic)</p>

<p>Jennifer: (earnestly) “No, tell me!” (&larr;Jennifer feels topics about Sam are relevant to her)</p> 

<p>When Sam tells the drama team about his coffee adventures in Philadelphia, he’s trying to make them feel connection, delight, realization, and so on—but the irrelevance of the topic keeps this humor attempt from being particularly fitted.</p> 

<p>By contrast, when Sam tells Jennifer about his coffee adventures, the topic is more relevant—since the closer people are to each other, the more topics that relate to one relate to the other.</p>
