Sometimes we think that we should be able to rationalize humor or humor dress codes—perhaps through lists of permitted and forbidden content. But this misunderstands humor and emotions more generally.

For instance, we know we can’t verbally promise ourselves that we won’t be angry or sad next week—or sign a binding contract that we’ll only feel happiness next week. These promises or contracts wouldn’t do anything! 

For similar reasons, we can’t sign a contract determining what we’ll find fitted or unfitted in the future. We can’t control humor dress codes in this way.

> Consider:

This doesn’t stop people from trying. For instance, during the French revolution, the constitutional assembly formally banned laughter at their meetings. Their goal was to become more effective, deliberative, grave, rational, and so on—but interestingly, an unfollowable rule brought them further away from all of those things. Laughter continued, and there really wasn’t anything formal rules could do about it.

 

The constitutional assembly was attempting to control humor dress codes through dictate, not through emotional collaboration—but this never works. 

Even though they can't, people still try to control dress codes by dictate all the time:



Stephen calls an all-staff meeting.

Stephen: “There will be no laughing during all-hands meeting. None. Got it? We’re going to spend the rest of the hour figuring out what’s happening in research. We don’t have time for humor.” (<- Stephen tries to set a dress code in advance)



Tucker calls an all-staff meeting.

Tucker: “Now I want us to have fun. We have to laugh. No frown-y faces. C’mon everyone. Let’s laugh. Ha ha ha! Amber, why don’t you start us off with a joke? Anything goes!” (<- Tucker tries to set a dress code in advance)

Stephen is trying to set the dress code so high that any humor would be seen as unfitted—Tucker wants to set it so low that any humor or humor attempt would be fitted. The problem is that dress codes aren’t something they have centralized control over.

When we think we should be able to set dress codes unilaterally, we not only low-rank others—we won’t succeed either!

> Consider:

If we want to raise a dress code, everyone around us will need to have a non-theoretical reason for increased efficiency and cohesion. It’s not enough for Stephen to feel a need for efficiency and cohesion—in a room of twenty people, he’s only 1/20th of the opinion on this.



The dress code won't raise until everyone present also agrees on the need for increased efficiency and cohesion. It's the same for Tucker—it’s not until everyone else sees a need for less efficiency or cohesion that the dress code would actually lower like Tucker wants.

At best, Stephen could try to censor—rather than censure—humor. He could try to force people to behave as if the dress code was a certain way, but this is a bit like making people enjoy our birthday party at gunpoint—the picture of what he want only.

If the staff is cowed, they may censor themselves the way Stephen wants—but this is different than Stephen actually setting the dress code for them. He’d just compelling behavior, not changing what they internally recognize as fitted or unfitted.

> Consider:

Teachers often do this with students. When students don't feel any need for efficiency or cohesion, they lower their dress code and goof off. Instead of addressing the cause of their lower dress code (boredom, lack of perceived need for efficiency or cohesion), the teacher tries to force them to not goof off (censor). The teacher wants to unilaterally set the dress code in a way that goes against how dress codes are actually set.

 

Sometimes teachers think classes need to get serious (raise a dress code) before they get started, but this is often backwards—we actually need to get started before we get serious. That's because moving into an activity that requires greater cohesion and efficiency will naturally raise the dress code—while simply yelling at people to knock it off tries to ineffectively force a dress code through censoring.

Sometimes, we think humor is counterproductive—but that's wrong. That's because fitted humor is by definition productive—it’s doing many things at once in a way that meets the current minimum standard. 

If we can't distinguish between fitted and unfitted humor, and so tried to censure all humor, we'd be throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Removing all humor would be a solution that creates problems.

> Consider:
Sometimes we think we can get rid of dress codes, like when we go to an anything goes comedy club. But that’s an illusion—any non-chaotic group of people will always form dress codes. 

 

This is why an audience that's hungry for taboo jokes will still censure annoying laughter in the audience, or why members of a boundary-pushing meme forum will still censure people making fun of members a certain way. The dress codes haven't gone away, and those audiences haven't been exempted from the normal process that sets them!

 

Similarly, sometimes people say a certain topic is off-limits, but we can’t turn off our ability to find some humor attempts on that topic fitted. Often, saying something is off-limits is just indicating that people tend to have a higher dress code on that topic than elsewhere.

When we understand how dress codes work, we can better influence them or make sense of why people are behaving the way they are. When we see people having fun when we think they should be serious, or being serious where we think they should be having fun, we don't only need to be frustrated—since their dress code gives us insight into how they’re seeing the world around them.

This information lets us make changes to our approach or to our environment in ways that accords with how people work. This is genuine leadership on an emotion network—and not simply flailing with censorship, trying to ban or force changes to humor in ways that conflict with how we work.
