<p>We can censure humor or a humor attempt, even if we feel humor:</p>


<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe hugs a stranger.</narration></p>

<div class="vignette">

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Jessica and Tom are washing dishes at the dish pit.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*offers sprayer*</action> <speech>“Sprayer?”</speech></p>

    <p><speaker>Tom:</speaker> <internalaction>(embarrassed)</internalaction> <speech>“Spray 'er? I hardly know ‘er.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*gets it*</action> <action>*laughs*</action> <internalaction>(vaguely disapproving)</internalaction> <notes>(&larr;Jessica censures Tom even though she laughed)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Tom:</speaker> <action>*apologetically*</action> <speech>“Sorry.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Tom censures himself)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <speech>“No, you’re all good. I laughed.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jessica equates humor with fittedness)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Tom:</speaker> <speech>“No, I should probably keep vaguely misogynistic jokes to a minimum at work.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Tom censures himself again.)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <speech>“Well. Probably!”</speech> </p>
</div>

<p>Above, just because Jessica felt humor doesn’t mean a humor attempt can’t also be unfitted. That’s because we can feel an <term>emotion</term> of humor at the same time our <em>judgement</em> can be that it’s unfitted.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This is obvious with other emotions. We might feel anger, but that by itself doesn’t tell us anything about whether the anger is fitted or not. Simply having an emotion in our emotional state doesn’t mean it’s fitted.</p>
</div>


 <p>We often censure ourselves too:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(sad)</internalaction> <speech>“I dropped my coffee on the way here”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <action>*restrains laughter*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe censures herself to resynchronize with Emma)</notes> <speech>“Sorry. That sucks.”</speech></p>
</div>


<p>When Zoe censures herself, that doesn’t mean she thinks her humor was “bad”—she’s just resynchronizing with her emotion network. Zoe is showing her commitment to maintaining a mutually agreeable standard of efficiency and cohesion.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Rule-breaking.</headline> Unfitted humor attempts can be fun, important, and useful—when they avoid censure. Sometimes, these can be useful even <sem>when</sem> they're censured. For instance, sometimes:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>a shocking joke breaks the ice</li>
        <li>a needling comment leads to a productive conversation</li>
        <li>unexpected swearing brings people together</li>
        <li>an off-color joke sets off a redeeming riff</li>
        <li>a random joke starts a conversation</li>
        <li>an out-of-the-blue invitation starts a friendship</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>We often observe and admire instances of this that are done well, and want to learn to do them ourselves. Counterintuitively, we learn to do these things well by first learning the formal rules well. This gives us the emotional sophistication to productively bend the rules.</p>
    
<p>In many ways, this is like real dress codes, for clothes. The better we understand the rules, the better we can break those rules in ways others appreciate instead of finding erratic or underwhelming.</p>
