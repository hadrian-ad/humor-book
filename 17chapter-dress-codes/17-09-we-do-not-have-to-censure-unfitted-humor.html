    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">It's optional whether we censure unfitted humor</h1>

  
<p>While we <term>can</term> censure a humor attempt when it’s below dress code, we don’t <em>have</em> to. There's often no reason to censure unfitted humor—like if everyone is still synchronized after unfitted humor:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“What if we…”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“…shit all over the classroom?”</speech> *laughs harder* <notes>(&larr;unfitted humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Class, I’ve never read…” <action>*laughs*</action> “…such mush… before…”</speech> <notes>(&larr;unfitted humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*crying from laughter*</action> <speech>“Such slippery prose…”</speech> <notes>(&larr;unfitted humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen and Emma:</speaker> <action>*whoop with laughter*</action> <notes>(&larr;unfitted humor)</notes></p>
    
    </div> 
    
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Think fast, Zo!”</speech> <action>*flicks a sunflower seed at her*</action> <notes>(&larr;unfitted humor attempt)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Return fire! Fire the catapults!”</speech> <action>*loads spoon with grape*</action> <notes>(&larr;unfitted humor attempt)</notes></p> 
    </div>

<p>Owen can make an accurate emotional forecast of how <term>Zoe</term> will react when he flicks things at her. This lets him confidently make this unfitted humor attempt with her.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">By contrast, Owen couldn't forecast how a <em>stranger</em> would react if he flicked things at them—which is why Owen is more likely to have unfitted humor with a friend like Zoe than with a stranger.</p>
</div>


<p>Being below dress code just means that <sem>if</sem> we censure it, others will find that censure justified:</p>

<p>Above, Sam doesn’t bother to censure an unfitted humor attempt himself. But if someone censures it, Sam will see their censure as justified.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">That doesn’t mean Sam would approve of censure of any strength. Instead, Sam will see censure as justified in proportion to how unfitted it was.</p>

<p class="considertetx">Since Jasper’s humor attempt wasn’t particularly unfitted, Sam will see a good-natured groan as justified censure—but will see yelling at the stage as unjustified censure.

     <p><headline>Normalcy.</headline> Desynchronization and resynchronization is a normal part of being around others, because censure and dress codes are how we group and collaborate:</p> 
     
     <div class="vignette">

     </div> 
     
     <p>Above, Zoe’s censure of Emma <callback>(exaggerated grimace)</callback> wasn’t received as harsh—it was just part of a collaborative, back-and-forth process that allowed evaluations to be shared and reacted to. This allowed a group to reach a consensus in just a few seconds.</p>
     
     <p>Censure is just a normal part of how conversations and groups work—and only occasionally does the same mechanism get scaled up to become confrontational.</p>
