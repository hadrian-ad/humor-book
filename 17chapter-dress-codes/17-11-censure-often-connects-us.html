<p>We often think of censure as something that divides people. But censure usually connects us instead:</p> 

<p><narration>Jasper makes a joke with a tasteless fake accent, and it’s cringey. Sam meets a stranger’s eye.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam and a stranger connect with each other by censuring Jasper)</notes></p>

 

<p><narration>Justin and Heather are cleaning up after a dinner party.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*amused*</action> <speech>“How about Travis just barging into every conversation?!”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <speech>“I couldn’t believe it!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin and Heather connect with each other by censuring Travis)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <internalaction>(mimicking)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh you went to Philly? That reminds of the time I went to Seoul!”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Heather:</speaker> <internalaction>(mimicking)</internalaction> <speech>“Fantastic. Fantastic!”</speech></p>

<p><narration>They continue bonding as they clean.</narration></p>

 

<p><narration>Sam and the rest of the administrators have to watch a new training video. It’s full of tedious puns. It’s both infantilizing and a waste of time. People adjust themselves in their seats, check their phones, and sigh. Everyone is aware of how much they are all hating this.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam and the rest of staff connect with each other by censuring video)</notes></p>


<p>In the examples above, the censure is something people are doing with each other, not against each other:</p> 

<p>When Sam and a stranger exchange looks at Jasper’s fake accent, they’re checking to confirm that they have synchronized evaluations—which tightens them as a subnetwork. Whether Jasper notices this censure is neither here nor there.</p>


<p>Justin and Heather are synchronizing in a way tightens their emotion network—but they intentionally waited until Travis is gone to do this. Their censure is something they do with each other, not something they do against someone.</p>



<p>Heather and Justin are processing mistakes together. They’re shifting mistakes and OKs into balance and easing tension, sharing personal views, acceptably criticizing, and so on.</p>

<p>The school administrators are watching a video, which means they can’t censure the people who made the training video—there’s no one there to censure! Their censure is something they do together. They want to make sure everyone shares their grievances about the video.</p>

<p>Most censure is connective like this—it synchronizes groups more tightly. Censure is usually used to calibrate groups or connect people together—and is only rarely used to confrontationally divide or fragment groups.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Censure often redefines groups. This often happens subtly, like over the course of a dinner. Nothing really happens, other than a shift in some of the group dynamics.</p> 
   
<p class="considertext">Sometimes this happens more aggressively. Enough connective censure builds up that we’re able to exclude or expel the target of our censure. But even though this is sometimes an outcome of this process, it’s not the most common outcome or the main general goal of this process.</p>

 </div>

<p>Humor dress codes and censure are how we communicate, group, and organize. In our day-to-day lives, humor dress codes allow feedback in ways that allows social groups to function well together.</p>
