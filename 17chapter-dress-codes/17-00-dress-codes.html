<p>Last chapter, we looked at the “fittedness” of humor or humor attempts—how well humor fit in a situation:</p> 

    <img src=../images/17c-images-fittedness/16-01-humor-can-fit-a-situation/16-01-0-garden.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>The more fittedness something has, the more relevant and communicatively rich it is—and the more it helps us group together.</p>

 

<p>But to make the most of an idea like “fittedness,” we’ll also need what we’ll call a “humor dress code”—how much fittedness is needed in a given situation.</p>



<p>This is familiar with money. Let’s say we have $5. Is $5 enough, or not enough?</p>



 

<p>We can’t answer this question until we know what we want to buy! If we want to buy candy, $5 is enough. If we want to buy an entire pizza, $5 is not enough.</p>



<p>We’ll be doing the same thing with fittedness—is “5” fittedness enough (fitted), or not enough (unfitted)?</p>



<p>We won’t know until we know the humor dress code!</p>

  

<p>We’ll be going over this in greater detail throughout this chapter.</p>



<p>Fitted and unfitted. Let’s say two humor attempts have the same fittedness— “5.” Even though we know the fittedness, we don’t know which ones will be fitted or unfitted—we also need to know the dress code.</p>

<p>If the dress code is “6,” a humor attempt of 5 will be unfitted—but if the dress code is “4,” a humor attempt of 5 will be fitted.</p> 

 

<p>In this chapter, we won’t use specific quantification metaphors like this—we're just showing what it means to say something is "fitted" (above dress code) and "unfitted" (below dress code).</p>
