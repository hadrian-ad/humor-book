<p>In previous chapters, we've looked at <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a>—how well humor or humor attempts fit in a situation:</p>

<p>In this chapter, we'll be looking at <sem>how much</sem> fittedness is needed in a given situation&mdash;what we'll call the <vocab>humor dress code</vocab>:</p>

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to money. Let’s say we have $5. Is $5 enough, or not enough?</p>

<p>We can’t answer this question until we know what we want to buy! $5 is enough if we want to buy candy&mdash;it's not enough if we want to buy an entire pizza.</p>

<p>We’ll be doing the same thing with fittedness. If our humor attempt has “5” fittedness, is that enough (<vocab>fitted</vocab>), or not enough (<vocab>unfitted</vocab>)?</p>

<p>Just like we don't know if $5 is enough until we know what we want to use it for, we won’t know if "5" fittedness is enough until we know the humor dress code!</p>

<p><headline>Fitted and unfitted.</headline> In this book, something that's <term>"fitted"</term> is <term>above</term> dress code, while something that's <em>"unfitted"</em> is <em>below</em> the dress code.</p>
    
<p>This means what fits and what doesn't is relative to a dress code. A humor attempt with fittedness of "5" will be <term>unfitted</term> if the dress code is "6," but <em>fitted</em> if the dress code is "4":</p>

<p>
    Being "fitted" or "unfitted" is a relative term to the dress code. That means it's not enough to know fittedness <term>by itself</term>&mdash;since we <em>also</em> need the dress code.</p>
