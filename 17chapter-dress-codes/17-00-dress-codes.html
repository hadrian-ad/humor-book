<p>In previous chapters, we've looked at <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a>&mdash;how well humor or humor attempts fit in a situation:</p>

    alt="This image shows a fittedness bar graph. It has fittedness along the Y axis with a single bar. A integration figure is shown, where the number of relevant topics, humor family words, humor outcomes, and humor tells all feed into how tall a bar graph is.";

<p>In this chapter, we'll be looking at <sem>how much</sem> fittedness is needed in a given situation&mdash;what we'll call the <vocab>humor dress code</vocab>:</p>

    alt="This dress code bar graph has added in a dotted line labeled 'dress code,' with arrows pointing above and below. Above the dotted line is increasingly more fitted, and below the dotted line is increasingly more unfitted. There are two bars, one above the dress code line and one beneath it. A legend marks one as a fitted comment, and the other as an unfitted comment.";

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to money. Let’s say we have $5. Is $5 enough, or not enough?</p>

<p>We can’t answer this question until we know what we want to buy! $5 is enough if we want to buy candy&mdash;it's not enough if we want to buy an entire pizza.</p>

<p>We’ll be doing the same thing with fittedness. If our humor attempt has “5” fittedness, is that enough (<vocab>fitted</vocab>), or not enough (<vocab>unfitted</vocab>)?</p>

<p>Just like we don't know if $5 is enough until we know what we want to use it for, we won’t know if "5" fittedness is enough until we know the humor dress code!</p>

<p><headline>Fitted and unfitted.</headline> In this book, something that's <term>"fitted"</term> is <term>above</term> dress code, while something that's <em>"unfitted"</em> is <em>below</em> the dress code.</p>
    
<p>This means what fits and what doesn't is relative to a dress code. A humor attempt with fittedness of "5" will be <term>unfitted</term> if the dress code is "6," but <em>fitted</em> if the dress code is "4":</p>

<p>
    Being "fitted" or "unfitted" is a relative term to the dress code. That means it's not enough to know fittedness <term>by itself</term>&mdash;since we <em>also</em> need the dress code.</p>
