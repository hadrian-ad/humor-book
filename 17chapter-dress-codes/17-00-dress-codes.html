<p>We've been looking at the <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a> of humor or humor attempts—how well humor fits in a situation:</p>

<p>But to make the most of an idea like “fittedness,” we’ll also need what we’ll call a <vocab>humor dress code</vocab>—which is <sem>how much</sem> fittedness is required by a given situation.</p>

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to money. Let’s say we have $5. Is $5 enough, or not enough?</p>

<p>We can’t answer this question until we know what we want to buy! $5 is enough if we want to buy candy&mdash;it's not enough if we want to buy an entire pizza.</p>

<p>We’ll be doing the same thing with fittedness. If our humor attempt has “5” fittedness, is that enough (<vocab>fitted</vocab>), or not enough (<vocab>unfitted</vocab>)?</p>

     >

<p>Just like we don't know if $5 is enough until we know what we want to use it for, we won’t know if "5" fittedness is enough until we know the humor dress code!</p>

<p>We’ll be going over this in greater detail throughout this chapter.</p>


<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Fitted and unfitted.</headline> In this book, something that's <term>"fitted"</term> is <term>above</term> dress code, while something that's <em>"unfitted"</em> is <em>below</em> the dress code.</p>
    
<p>That means fittedness is relative to a dress code. A humor attempt with fittedness of "5" will be unfitted if the dress code is "6," but fitted if the dress code is "4":</p>

         >
    
<p>
   That's why knowing fittedness by itself isn't enough to decide whether something is fitted or unfitted&mdash;since we also need the dress code.</p>
