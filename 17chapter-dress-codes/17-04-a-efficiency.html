<p class="lesson">
    Humor dress codes are set by the need for <i>efficiency</i> and cohesion
</p>
    
<p>The dress code goes up whenever we have a complex goals or tasks&mdash;and we need to be <vocab>efficient</vocab>. 
  

   
    <p>We’ve seen before how the more fitted a humor attempt is, the more it's doing many things at once:</p>    
    

    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Justin’s walking out of the English department when Dave catches him.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Justin! The department’s going to get some drinks tonight. You should come!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*shaking head*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>"Thanks, but I’d better pass. The mountain of sobriety, you know, Tantalus and Sisyphus. Maybe another event!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;<humor-outcome>reveals a personal trait</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoids conflict (while declining an invitation)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deals with a taboo topic (alcoholism)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supports an argument (that he has a valid excuse to decline)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>shares a perspective (he’s sober)</humor-outcome>, and so on)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Sure, I get it. Maybe another time, another event then!”</speech></p>

        alt="This integration graph shows how Justin's comment attempts to reach many humor outcomes at once. An annotation says 'Justin efficiently does all of this in a brief exchange.'";

    <p>Justin was efficient&mdash;he was doing many relevant things at once, very quickly. 
    
    <div class="consider">
        <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>--> 
        
        <p>Simply saying <callback>"no"</callback>  in a funny voice <sem-weak>wouldn't</sem-weak> have been more efficient, despite using fewer words. That's because <callback>"no"</callback> would just be doing <term>one</term> thing <callback>(declining)</callback>, instead of doing <term2>many</term2> things <callback>(dealing with a taboo topic, supporting an argument, sharing a perspective, and so on)</callback>.</p>
    </div>
    

    
    <p>By setting a higher dress code, we encourage <term>efficient</term> humor attempts, and <outcome-contrast>discourage</outcome-contrast> <term2>inefficient</term2> humor attempts. A higher dress code raises our standard of minimum effectiveness.</p> 
    
        
    <p>A higher standard of fittedness allows groups to accomplish more in less time, while weeding out less efficient things&mdash;but we only apply this higher standard when there’s actually something we want to accomplish efficiently.</p>

    <div class="for-instance">
        <!--<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>--> 
        
        <p>If ten people take turns giving feedback on a proposal, we’ll want to move through everyone efficiently&mdash;and we know that if someone takes time to make an unfitted humor attempt <callback>(“totally re-markable!”)</callback> they’ll slow the process down without justification. To avoid this, we raise the dress code.</p>
        
        <p>This doesn't <sem-weak>preclude</sem-weak> humor at the meeting&mdash;just raises the standard of efficiency of humor and humor attempts.</p>
