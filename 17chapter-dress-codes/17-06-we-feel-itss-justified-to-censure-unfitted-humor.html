<p>The humor dress code tells us when humor is vulnerable to <vocab>censure</vocab>.</p>

          This is like real dress codes, for clothes. If the dress code is <callabck>"all black,"</callabck> we know when others will find censure justified. <callback>("Yellow? Did you miss the memo?")</callback>

<p>If a humor attempt is <term>above</term> the dress code, it's <em>resistant</em> to censure. If a humor attempt is <term>below</term> the dress code, it's <em>vulnerable</em> to censure.</p>

<p>When we see the picture below, it probably doesn’t occur to us to censure their humor—since their humor seems to have high fittedness (<emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on on relevant topics) and a relatively low dress code <callback>(danger has passed)</callback>:</p>

<p>But if we instead imagine they’re feeling humor during an important part of their mission—maybe because someone walked in with donuts—we'd immediately feel justified in censuring them. The fittedness of bringing in donuts wouldn't exceed the high humor dress code set the situation:</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext">When there's a critical part of their mission <callback>(more need for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, the dress code goes up. When there's a stable part of their mission <callback>(less need for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, the dress code goes down.</p>

<p>The dress code sets when censure of humor or humor attempts feels <sem>justified</sem>.</p>

<p>When someone feels humor or a humor attempt is <term>below</term> dress code <callback>(<outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> meeting a minimum standard for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, they feel censure of it is <em>justified</em>. If they feel it's <term>above</term> dress code <callback>(meeting a minimum standard for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>, they'll feel censure of it is <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> <em>justified</em>.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We used an extreme examples above <callback>(abandoning mission control versus not)</callback>, but the same dynamic happens all across our lives.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext"> People may cheer when donuts are brought into a classroom, or grin or stretch during a conversation&mdash;and we can intuitively imagine moments where these are either unfitted and fitted&mdash;where censure of them feels justified or not.</p>
      </div>


<!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The point here isn't that it's a always big deal to grin or stretch in a way that others see as unfitted. Instead, the point is to notice that we notice these things. We register when something seems situationally unjustified, and our registering this is itself a light form of censure.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Emotion dress codes.</headline> We have dress codes for all our emotions. For instance, just like humor, anger isn’t <sem>always</sem> tolerated or <sem>always</sem> censured—instead, it depends on whether the anger is fitted or not.</p>
    
    <p>When anger is fitted, it’s seen as <term>justified</term>&mdash;and we describe that justified anger as natural or righteous. When anger is instead unfitted, it’s seen as <em>unjustified</em>&mdash;and we describe that unjustified anger as petty, a tantrum, thin-skinned, whining, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>The fittedness of anger depends on how much it fits the situation. If we’re angry because someone put our children in danger, it's more fitted than if we’re angry because someone forgot the ketchup. We have a similar awareness of situational fittedness for any emotion, including humor or sadness.</p>
