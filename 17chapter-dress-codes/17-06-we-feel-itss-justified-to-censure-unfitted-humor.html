    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We feel it's justified to censure unfitted humor</h1>
    
   
<p>If a humor attempt is <term>above</term> the dress code, it’s fitted to the emotional situation—and so is resistant to censure. If a humor attempt is <em>below</em> the dress code, it’s not fitted to the emotional situation—and so is vulnerable to censure.</p>

<p>We saw this before in the picture of the aerospace project. Their dress code goes up when there’s a critical part of the mission <callback>(more need for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>. Their dress code goes down when there’s a stable part of the mission <callback>(less need for efficiency and cohesion)</callback>.</p>

<p>When we see the picture below, it probably doesn’t occur to us to censure their humor—since their humor seems to have high fittedness (<emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on on relevant topics) and a relatively low dress code <callback>(danger has passed)</callback>:</p>

<p>But if we instead imagine they’re feeling humor during an important part of their mission—maybe because someone walked in with donuts—we'd immediately feel justified in censuring them. The fittedness of bringing in donuts wouldn't exceed the high humor dress code set the situation:</p>

<p>This is obvious in extreme situations, but the same dynamic happens all across our lives. Sometimes this is obvious <callback>(people laugh and celebrate when we bring in donuts during an important moment of conversation)</callback>, but other times its very subtle <callback>(we grin or stretch during an important moment of conversation)</callback>.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The point here isn't that it's a always big deal to grin or stretch in a way that others see as unfitted. Instead, the point is to notice that we notice these things. We register when something seems situationally unjustified, and our registering this is itself a light form of censure.</p>
</div>


<p>We're not always in agreement with each other on the dress code—but when someone feels humor or a humor attempt is below dress code, they feel their censure of it is justified.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Humor dress codes are the line where two competing measures meet: the justification for censure, and the justification for a humor attempt. The dress code is the line where one justification is larger than the other.</p>
    
    </div> 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Emotion dress codes.</headline> We have dress codes for all our emotions. For instance, anger isn’t <term>always</term> tolerated or <term>always</term> condemned—instead, it depends on whether the anger is <em>fitted</em> or not.</p>
    
    <p>When anger is fitted, it’s seen as justified—and so it’s described as being natural or righteous. When anger is instead unfitted, it’s seen as unjustified—and so it’s described as petty, a tantrum, thin-skinned, whining, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>The fittedness of anger depends on how much it fits the situation. If we’re angry because someone put our children in danger, it's more fitted than if we’re angry because someone forgot the ketchup. We have a similar awareness of situational fittedness for any emotion, including humor or sadness.</p>
