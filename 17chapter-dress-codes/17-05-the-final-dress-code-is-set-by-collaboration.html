    <p>We set the dress code collaboratively with everyone around us.</p> 
  
  <p class="lesson">
    Humor dress codes are set by an <i>agreed understanding</i> of the need for efficiency and cohesion
</p>
  
<p>Everyone around us estimates the need for efficiency and cohesion. But since not everyone arrives at the same estimation, we compromise toward each other to finalize the dress code:
</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: "> 



 

<p>When we treat everyone around us as equals, we’ll compromise by setting the dress code somewhere in the middle of where everyone thinks it should be.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
   <p class="considertext">We arrive at agreements like this all the time. If <term>we</term> swear a lot and our <term>friend</term> doesn’t, we’ll compromise—<em>we’ll</em> swear less, and <em>they’ll</em> be okay with some more swearing. The exact compromise is weighted toward who cares most about it.</p>
   
   <p class="considertext">
    This doesn't happen instantaneously&mdash;it happens like a mutual game of warmer and colder. We adjust over time through mutual feeback until we eventually reach a point where both of us are comfortable.  
   </p>
   
    </div>
 

<!--
[cutexamples]
     <p>Sometimes people <sem>don't</sem> treat us as equals, and rank us lower than themselves. In this case, they’ll try to set the dress code unilaterally, without compromising.</p>
      
      <p>
          For instance, our boss’s boss may try to set the dress code without our input, even if the formality <callback>(“my name is Steven Alexander Charles III”)</callback> or informality <callback>(“heyhey, I’m Steve!”)</callback> seem weird or off-putting to us.
      </p>
 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Our reaction to this depends on how we feel about being ranked as lower than them. If we rank them higher than us, this will feel normal or justified &mdash;but if we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> rank them higher, it'll feel degrading.</p>
</div>
-->

 
<!-- 
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes arriving at a shared dress code can be done precisely, like how close friends are acutely aware of the dress code around each other. They can minutely manage banter and feel where it comes.   
    
      <p class="considertext">Other times, we <sem>can't</sem> arrive at a precise shared dress code, like when we're on an large Internet forum&mdash;and there's a gray zone between what’s considered fitted and unfitted.</p>
</div>

-->
  
  <p>When we <term>agree</term> with the wider, finalized dress code, we feel <term>comfortable</term> and <term>integrated</term> on the emotion network&mdash;and we'll feel able to synchronize to the network in ways that feel acceptable to everyone, including ourselves.</p> 

<p>When we <outcome-contrast>don’t</outcome-contrast> <em>agree</em> to the finalized dress code, we often feel <em>uncomfortable</em> and <em>unintegrated</em>—and we won't feel able to synchronize to the network in ways that feel acceptable to everyone. </p> 


<div class="box"><p><headline>Precision.</headline> The exact dress code is never precise—instead, a dress code functions with ambiguity, disagreements, conflicting motivations, inconsistent enforcement, incomplete consensus, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>At first, it might seem dress codes function <term>despite</term> this ambiguity—but they actually function <em>because</em> of this ambiguity.</p>
                
        <p>Sometimes, we associate ambiguity with disorder or inefficiency. But in this case, the ambiguity gives us the flexibility needed for rich functionality. It allows for broad participation, consensus-seeking, exploration of boundaries, feedback, information-sharing, multiple ways of integrating, and so on.</p>
