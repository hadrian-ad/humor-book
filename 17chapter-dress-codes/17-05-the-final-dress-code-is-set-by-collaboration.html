    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">The final dress code is set by collaboration</h1>
    

<p>We set the dress code collaboratively with everyone around us. Each person estimates the dress code&mdash;but not everyone arrives at the same estimation.
</p>

<p>So to finalize the dress code, we compromise toward each other:</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: "> 



 

<p>When we treat everyone around us as equals, we’ll compromise by setting the dress code somewhere in the middle of where everyone thinks it should be.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
   <p class="considertext">We reach implicit agreements like this all the time. If <term>we</term> swear a lot and our <em>friend</em> doesn’t, we’ll <sem>compromise</sem>—we’ll swear less, and they’ll be okay with some more swearing. The exact compromise is weighted toward who cares most about it.</p>
   
   <p class="considertext">
    This happens like a mutual game of hot and cold&mdash;we adjust over time through mutual feeback. Eventually, we reach a point where both of us are comfortable.  
   </p>
   
    </div>
 

<!--
<p>Sometimes people <sem>don't</sem> treat us as equals, and rank us lower than themselves. In this case, they’ll try to set the dress code unilaterally, without compromising.</p>
      
      <p>
          For instance, our boss’s boss may try to set the dress code without our input, even if the formality <callback>(“my name is Steven Alexander Charles III”)</callback> or informality <callback>(“heyhey, I’m Steve!”)</callback> seem weird or off-putting to us.
      </p>
 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Our reaction to this depends on how we feel about being ranked as lower than them. If we rank them higher than us, this will feel normal or justified &mdash;but if we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> rank them higher, it'll feel degrading.</p>
</div>
-->

 
<!-- 
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes arriving at a shared dress code can be done precisely, like how close friends are acutely aware of the dress code around each other. They can minutely manage banter and feel where it comes.   
    
      <p class="considertext">Other times, we <sem>can't</sem> arrive at a precise shared dress code, like when we're on an large Internet forum&mdash;and there's a gray zone between what’s considered fitted and unfitted.</p>
</div>

-->
  
  <p>When we agree with the wider, finalized dress code, we feel  <term>comfortable</term> and integrated on the emotion network. We'll be able to synchronize to the network in ways that feel acceptable to everyone, including ourselves.</p> 

<p>When we <outcome-contrast>don’t</outcome-contrast> agree to the finalized dress code, we often feel <em>uncomfortable</em> and unintegrated—and we’ll leave that emotion network as quickly if we can, and won’t want to return.</p> 


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">The exact dress code is never precise—instead, a dress code functions with ambiguity, disagreements, conflicting motivations, inconsistent enforcement, incomplete consensus, and so on.</p> 

<p class="considertext">At first, it might seem dress codes function <term>despite</term> this ambiguity—but they actually function <em>because</em> of this ambiguity.</p>
            
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes, we associate ambiguity with disorder or inefficiency. But in this case, the ambiguity gives us the flexibility needed for rich functionality. It allows for broad participation, consensus-seeking, exploration of boundaries, feedback, information-sharing, multiple ways of integrating, and so on.</p>

    <p><headline>Describing.</headline> Dress codes aren't new to us&mdash;we already talk about them in our day-to-day language. This is especially obvious when we <sem>disagree</sem> with the humor dress code.</p>
    
     <p>When we think the dress code is too <term>high</term>, we use words like <callback>buzzkill, joyless, snooty, stuck-up</callback>:</p>

     <p>When we think the dress code is too <em>low</em>, we use words like <callback>disrespectful, flippant, informal, permissive, unserious,</callback> and so on.</p>

    <p>We don't want to spend much time on an emotion network with a dress code we don't agree with&mdash;we don't like being somewhere that we'd describe as <callback>snooty</callback>:</p> 
    
    <p>Of course, to the people there, it doesn’t feel <callback>snooty</callback> in a bad way—they’ve agreed to a high dress code for reasons that seem justified to them. It's just a normal, comfortable dress code to them&mdash;the way any dress code we agree with seems to us.</p>
    
    <p>When we don’t agree with the dress code, we often either resist it or don’t know how to conform to it;s—and either way, we feel out of place.</p>
