    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">1The final dress code is set by collaboration</h1>
    

<p>Each person estimates the dress code, but not everyone arrives at the same estimation. Usually, there’s some disagreement: 
</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: "> 



<p>To finalize the dress code, we compromise toward each other. We set the dress code collaboratively with everyone around us.</p> 

<p>When we treat everyone around us as equals, we’ll set the dress code somewhere in the middle of where everyone thinks it should be.</p> 

 

<p>If they’re <sem>not</sem> treating us as an equal, but instead low-ranking us, they’ll try to set the dress code unilaterally, without compromising. For instance, our boss’s boss may try to set the dress code without our input, even if the formality <callback>(“my name is Steven Alexander Charles III”)</callback> or informality <callback>(“heyhey, I’m Steve!”)</callback></p>


<p>Our reaction to this depends on how we feel being about being low-ranked. If the low-ranking seems justified or normal to us, then we’re simultaneously high-ranking them—and letting them set the dress code feels acceptable. But if they low-rank us and we <sem>don’t</sem> high-rank them, we’ll find obedience to their unilateral dress code distasteful or degrading.</p>

 

<p>Sometimes arriving at a shared dress code can be done precisely, like how close friends are acutely aware of the dress code around each other. Other times, it’s less precise, like how internet forums can have a broad gray zone between what’s considered fitted and unfitted.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
   <p class="considertext">We do similar collaborations all the time. If we swear a lot and our friend doesn’t, we’ll compromise—we’ll swear less, and they’ll be okay with some more swearing. The exact compromise is weighted toward who cares most about it.</p>
    
     
    </div>
<p>We often set dress codes in subtle ways. But sometimes we have explicit disagreements about it—like when we feel someone should “be serious” and raise their standard of fittedness.</p>

<p>It feels destructive when we can't arrive at a shared understanding of a situation’s need for effectiveness and cohesion.</p>


<p>When we <term>agree</term> with the wider, finalized dress code, we can comfortably join the emotion network and synchronize in a ways that feel acceptable to everyone, including ourselves.</p> 

<p>When we <em>don’t</em> agree to the finalized dress code, we often feel uncomfortable and unintegrated—and we’ll leave as quickly if we can, and won’t want to return to these emotion networks.</p> 

<p>The exact dress code is never precise—instead, a dress code functions with ambiguity, disagreements, conflicting motivations, inconsistent enforcement, incomplete consensus, and so on.</p> 

<p>At first, it might seem dress codes function <term>despite</term> this ambiguity—but they actually function <em>because</em> of this ambiguity.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes, we associate ambiguity with disorder or inefficiency. But in this case, the ambiguity gives us the flexibility needed for rich functionality. It allows for broad participation, consensus-seeking, exploration of boundaries, information-sharing, multiple ways of integrating, and so on.</p>
</div>

 


<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Describing.</headline> We already have plenty of ways to describe dress codes in our day-to-day language—especially when we disagree with them. When we think the dress code is too <term>high</term>, we use words like <callback>buzzkill, joyless, snooty, stuck-up</callback>. When we think the dress code is too <em>low</em>, we use words like <callback>disrespectful, flippant, informal, permissive, unserious,</callback> and so on.</p>

    <p>If a group seems <callback>snooty</callback> to us, the dress code is higher that we feel like agreeing to—and we won’t want to to fully join the emotion network. Of course, to the people there, it doesn’t feel <callback>snooty</callback> in a bad way—they’ve agreed to a high dress code for reasons that seem justified to them.</p>
    
    <p>When we don’t agree with the dress code, we often either resist it or don’t know how to conform—and either way, we feel out of place.</p>
