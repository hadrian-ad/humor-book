    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Higher dress codes ensure higher group coordination</h1>
    
   
<p>The humor dress code is set by our need for efficiency and cohesion—when groups want to accomplish more in less time, the dress code goes up.</p>   

<p>To get a better sense of this, we can look at <sem>efficiency</sem> and <sem>cohesion</sem> one-by-one:</p>

<p><strong>Efficient</strong>. We’ve seen before how fittedness means a humor attempt is doing many things at once&mdash;it's efficient:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Justin’s walking out of the English department when Dave catches him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Justin! The department’s going to get some drinks tonight. You should come!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*shaking head*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>"Thanks, but I’d better pass. The mountain of sobriety, you know, Tantalus and Sisyphus. Maybe another event!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;reveals a personal trait, avoids conflict (while declining an invitation), deals with a taboo topic (alcoholism), supports an argument (that he has a valid excuse to decline), shares a perspective (he’s sober), and so on)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Sure, I get it. Maybe another time, another event then!”</speech></p>

<p>Justin was efficient—he was doing many relevant things at once, very quickly. If he instead said <callback>“no”</callback> in a funny voice, it wouldn’t be more efficient despite using fewer words—since he’d just be doing one thing, instead of many.</p>



 

<p>By setting a higher dress code, we <term>encourage</term> efficient humor attempts, and <em>discourage</em> inefficient humor attempts. A higher dress code raises our standard of minimum effectiveness.</p> 

 

<p>This is often obvious, like if ten people are taking turns quickly giving feedback on a proposal. We’ll want to move through everyone efficiently—and we know that if someone takes time to make an unfitted humor attempt <callback>(“totally re-markable!”)</callback>, they’ll slow the process down without justification. To avoid this, we raise the dress code.</p>

 

<p>A higher standard of fittedness allows groups to accomplish more in less time, while weeding out less efficient things. But this is only relevant when there’s actually something we want to accomplish efficiently.</p>

 
<p><strong>Cohesive.</strong> The less fittedness a humor attempt has, the more likely it will desynchronize or fragment an emotion network. That means that whenever it’s important or difficult to maintain cohesion, the dress code goes up.</p>

 

<p>We experience this all the time, like when we finally meet our close friend's partner for the first time:</p>

<p>When we want to stay synchronized with everyone else, we’re more careful to avoid humor attempts that might desynchronize people on the emotion network.</p>

 <div class="consider">
<p class="consider">Consider:</p>
<p class="considertext">This is why a conference involving many religious denominations will have a higher dress code than a conference of just the same denomination.</p> 

<p class="considertext">That doesn’t mean there’ll be no humor—it just means the minimum fittedness goes up, since the conference wants to avoid desynchronizing the emotion network and hardening people into subnetworks. A higher dress code keeps the event cohesive.</p>

</div>
 

    <p>Our humor dress code is the minimum standard for the complexity and coherence of our interactions—and this standard is constantly changing as the emotional situation changes.</p>





<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Politically correct.</headline> Advocacy organizations, charities, classrooms, international offices, big-tent political parties, public agencies, and so on all have high dress codes—since they’re goal-specific groups <callback>(need effectiveness)</callback> and have varied clients, customers, members, supporters, and so on <callback>(need cohesion)</callback>.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>These organizations want to avoid pointlessly fragmenting the emotional networks associated with them, while at the same time promoting efficient and effective communication. This means that our humor dress code goes up while actively participating in these groups, and goes down again when we’re not.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>Sometimes we’re surprised that humor attempts are received differently in a classroom than at our home—we think everywhere should have the same receptivity to our humor attempts.</p> 
    
    
    
    <p>But this gives a double standard for humor that we don't for other things. We also try to make people feel affection, anger, exuberance, frustration, pleasure, sadness, and so on—but we don't think it's surprising that these are treated differently at home than they are in a classroom or government agency. For the same reasons, it shouldn't be surprising when humor attempts are treated differently in different situations.</p>
