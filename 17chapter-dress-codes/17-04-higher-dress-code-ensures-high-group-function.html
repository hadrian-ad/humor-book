    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Higher dress codes ensure higher group coordination</h1>
    
   
<p>When a group wants to accomplish more in less time, the humor dress code goes up. That's because the humor dress code is set by shared needs for <sem>efficiency</sem> and <sem>cohesion</sem>.</p>   

<h2>Efficiency</h2> 

<div class="h2">
    <p>We’ve seen before how fittedness means a humor attempt is doing many things at once:</p>
    
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Justin’s walking out of the English department when Dave catches him.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Justin! The department’s going to get some drinks tonight. You should come!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*shaking head*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>"Thanks, but I’d better pass. The mountain of sobriety, you know, Tantalus and Sisyphus. Maybe another event!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;reveals a personal trait, avoids conflict (while declining an invitation), deals with a taboo topic (alcoholism), supports an argument (that he has a valid excuse to decline), shares a perspective (he’s sober), and so on)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Sure, I get it. Maybe another time, another event then!”</speech></p>
        
        </div>
    
            <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-04-higher-dress-code-ensures-high-group-function/17-04-0-justin-efficiently-does-things.png
    
        alt="";
        title="";
        style="max-width: 37rem; margin-left: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> 
    
    
     
    
    <p>Justin was efficient—he was doing many relevant things at once, very quickly. 
    
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">Simply saying <callback>"no"</callback>  in a funny voice <outcome-contrast>wouldn't</outcome-contrast> have been more efficient, despite using fewer words. That's because <callback>"no"</callback> would just be doing <term>one</term> thing <callback>(declining)</callback>, instead of doing <em>many</em> things <callback>(dealing with a taboo topic, supporting an argument, sharing a perspective, and so on)</callback>.</p>
    </div>
    

    
    <p>By setting a higher dress code, we <term>encourage</term> <em>efficient</em> humor attempts, and <term>discourage</term> <em>inefficient</em> humor attempts. A higher dress code raises our standard of minimum effectiveness.</p> 
    
    <div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p> 
        
        <p class="for-instance-text">If ten people take turns giving feedback on a proposal, we’ll want to move through everyone efficiently—and we know that if someone takes time to make an unfitted humor attempt <callback>(“totally re-markable!”)</callback>, they’ll slow the process down without justification. To avoid this, we raise the dress code.</p>
    </div>
        
    <p>A higher standard of fittedness allows groups to accomplish more in less time, while weeding out less efficient things&mdash;but we only apply this higher standard when there’s actually something we want to accomplish efficiently.</p>
</div>

<h2>Cohesive</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <p>Whenever it’s important or difficult to maintain cohesion, the dress code goes up. That's because the more fitted a humor attempt is, the more likely an emotion network will have synchronized evaluations of it.
    </p>
    

    <p>We experience this all the time, like when we finally meet our close friend's partner for the first time:</p>
    
     
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*sitting on the deck*</action> <speech>“Hey. Do you think you could do it in a canoe without tipping it?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;low need for cohesion with friends&harr;&#xFE0E;low dress code)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <speech>“Screw in a… canoe?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Yeah—shagging no wagging!”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Dude, I could do it in ten canoes without tipping it.”</speech></p>
        
        <p><narration>Yasmin comes out onto the deck, smiling.</narration> <notes>(&larr;dress code increases)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*beaming*</action> <speech>“This is Yasmin! Yasmin, this is Minh”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <action>*stands up*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <action>*politely*</action> <speech>“Nice to meet you! Trevor keeps saying wonderful things about you.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;high need for cohesion when meeting new people&harr;&#xFE0E;higher dress code)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Thanks! Trevor says you’re a sculptor? That’s so neat!”</speech></p>

        alt="";
        title="";
        style="max-width: ; margin-left: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;"> 
    
    
     
    
    <p>When we want everyone to stay synchronized with everyone else, we collectively avoid humor attempts that might desynchronize our emotion network.</p>
    
    
            <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-04-higher-dress-code-ensures-high-group-function/17-04-2-fragmenting-network.png
    
        alt="";
        title="";
        style="max-width: ; margin-left: "> 
    
     
    
    
    
     <div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">Consider:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">A conference involving <term>many</term> religious denominations will have a higher dress code than a conference of just <em>one</em> denomination.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">That doesn’t mean there’ll be no humor. Instead, it just means the minimum fittedness goes up, since the conference wants to avoid desynchronizing the emotion network and hardening people into subnetworks. A higher dress code keeps the event cohesive.</p>
    
    </div>
</div>
 

    <p>Our humor dress code is the minimum standard for the complexity and coherence of our interactions—and this standard is constantly changing as the emotional situation changes.</p>


     <div class="consider">
         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         
         <p class="considertext">Advocacy organizations, charities, classrooms, international offices, big-tent political parties, public agencies, and so on all have high dress codes—since they’re goal-specific groups <callback>(need effectiveness)</callback> and have varied clients, customers, members, supporters, and so on <callback>(need cohesion)</callback>.</p>
             
         
             
             <p class="for-instance-text">These organizations want to avoid pointlessly fragmenting the emotional networks associated with them, while at the same time promoting efficient and effective communication. This means that our humor dress code goes up while actively participating in these groups, and goes down again when we’re not.</p>
     </div>



<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Relativity.</headline>     
    <p>Sometimes we’re surprised that humor attempts are received differently in different places. We sometimes think there should be a flat dress code everywhere&mdash;so what's good among friends should be good in a classroom or a public social media profile.</p> 
    
    <p>But this gives a double standard for <term>humor</term> compared to <em>other</em> emotions. We're not surprised that attempts to make others feel affection, anger, exuberance, frustration, pleasure, sadness, and so on are treated differently in different emotional situations.</p> 
     
    <p>A sultry photo of ourselves or a long frustrated rant is is treated one way one place, and another way another place. And for the same reasons, a joke is treated one way in one place, and another way in another.</p>
    
    <p>Since humor is a regular emotion, not surprising that humor attempts are treated differently in different emotional situations&mdash;since this is just like any emotional attempt.</p>
