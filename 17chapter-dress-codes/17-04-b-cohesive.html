    Humor dress codes are set by the need for efficiency and <i>cohesion</i>

    <p>The dress code goes up whenever it’s important or difficult to maintain <vocab>cohesion</vocab>.</p>

    <p>Minh and Yasmin's priority is to create feelings of <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on&mdash;or at least to avoid mistake-predominant emotions. This raises the dress code.</p> 
    
    
    <p>When we want everyone to stay synchronized with everyone else, we collectively avoid humor attempts that might desynchronize our emotion network.</p>

    <p class="for-instance">Consider:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">A conference involving <term>many</term> religious denominations will have a higher dress code than a conference of just <em>one</em> denomination.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">That doesn’t mean there’ll be no humor. Instead, it just means the minimum fittedness goes up, since the conference wants to avoid desynchronizing the emotion network, which can harden people into subnetworks. A higher dress code keeps the event cohesive by reducing risk of desynchronization.</p>
