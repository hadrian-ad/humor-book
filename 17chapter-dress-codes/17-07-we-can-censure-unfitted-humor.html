    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We're allowed to censure unfitted humor</h1>
    
   
<p>We censure humor or humor attempts by not synchronizing fully with someone.</p>
 
<p>In most cases, this is often simply not expressing an equal amount of humor tells:</p>

<p>We experience desynchronization as censure because we want others to synchronize with us—or for others to let us synchronize to them.</p>

<p>Essentially, someone is sharing an evaluatory perspective and by showing disagreement with that perspective, we censure them.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">In this book, “censure” is just withheld synchronization. That's often a lighter definition of censure than how we use the word in day-to-day conversations.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Under this definition, most of the day-to-day censure we receive isn't a big deal to us—it's just something done by everyone, including friends or family, in ways we think of as neither good nor bad, but just how things work.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Censure.</headline> “Censure” and “censor” are similar sounding words that mean different things. To <term>censure</term> is to <em>condemn</em>, while to <term>censor</term> is to <em>suppress communication</em>.</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li><strong>Censure</strong>: if a group of academics publish a letter condemning us, we have been <strong>censured</strong>. If our parents tell us it was inappropriate to make that humor attempt about Grandma, we have been <strong>censured</strong>. If people on social media react poorly to the joke we post, we have been <strong>censured</strong>. If our friend vaguely smiles at our joke in a way we feel is unenthusiastic, we have been <strong>censured</strong>.</li> 
        
        <li><strong>Censor</strong>: if a government commands an organization remove something we wrote, we have been <strong>censored</strong>. If a militia threatens us with violence if we continue airing a show, we have been <strong>censored</strong>. If a forum blots out swear words, the forum has <strong>censored</strong> those words.</li></ul>  
    
    <p>Generally, <term>censure</term> comes from <em>within</em> emotion network, in the form of desynchronization—while <term>censorship</term> is something <em>imposed</em> on an emotional network from outside of it.</p>
