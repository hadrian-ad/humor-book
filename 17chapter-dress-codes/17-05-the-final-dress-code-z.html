    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We already talk about dress codes</h1>

    <p>We already refer to dress codes in our day-to-day language&mdash;which is especially obvious when we <sem>disagree</sem> with the humor dress code.</p>
    
     <p>When we think the dress code is too <term>high</term>, we use words like <callback>buzzkill, joyless, snooty, stuck-up</callback>:</p>

     <p>When we think the dress code is too <em>low</em>, we use words like <callback>disrespectful, flippant, informal, permissive, unserious,</callback> and so on.</p>

    style="max-width: 24rem ; margin-left: ">
       
          
      
    <p>We don't want to spend much time on an emotion network with a dress code we don't agree with&mdash;we don't like being somewhere that we'd describe as <sem-weak>snooty</sem-weak>.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
        
        <p class="considertext">Of course, to the people there, the humor dress code doesn’t feel <sem-weak>snooty</sem-weak> in a bad way—they’ve agreed to a high dress code for reasons that seem justified to them. To them, it's just a normal, comfortable dress code to them&mdash;the way any dress code we agree with seems to us.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>When we <sem-weak>don’t</sem-weak> agree with the dress code, we often either resist it or don’t know how to conform to it—and either way, we feel out of place. We'll leave if we can, and won't want to return</p>
      
      
   <!--
    [cutexamples]   [add to low-ranking]
     <p>Sometimes people <sem>don't</sem> treat us as equals, and they see us as having a lower rank than themselves. In this case, they’ll try to set the dress code unilaterally, with little compromise.</p>
      
      <p>
          For instance, our boss’s boss may try to set the dress code without our input, even if the formality <callback>(“my name is Steven Alexander Charles III”)</callback> or informality <callback>(“heyhey, I’m Steve!”)</callback> seem weird or off-putting to us.
      </p>
 
    <p>Our reaction to this depends on how we feel about being ranked as lower than them. If we rank them higher than us, this will feel normal or justified &mdash;but if we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> rank them higher, it'll feel degrading.</p>
