    <h3 id="exclude-navigation">Describing dress codes</h3>

    <p>We already refer to dress codes in our day-to-day language&mdash;which is especially obvious when we <em>disagree</em> with the humor dress code.</p>
    
     <p>When we think the dress code is too <term>high</term>, we use words like <callback>buzzkill, joyless, snooty, stuck-up</callback>:</p>

    alt="This dress code figure has a dashed line for the dress code up top, and a dotted line for an alternate dress code below. Annotations say that if everyone thinks the dress code should be high, but we think it should be low, we'll call them stuck up.";
    title="Dress code figure I";
    style="max-width: 24rem; margin-left: ">
  

     <p>When we think the dress code is too <term2>low</term2>, we use words like <callback>disrespectful, flippant, informal, permissive, unserious,</callback> and so on.</p>

        
     <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-05-final-dress-code-set-by-collaboration/17-05-1-box-flippant.png

    alt="This dress code figure inverts the previous figure. An annotation says 'if everyone thinks the dress code should be low, but we think it should be high, we'll call them flippant.'";
    title="Dress code figure II";
    style="max-width: 24rem ; margin-left: ">
       
          
      
    <p>We don't want to spend much time on an emotion network with a dress code we don't agree with&mdash;we don't like being somewhere that we'd describe as <sem-weak>snooty</sem-weak>.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
        
        <p>Of course, to the people there, the humor dress code doesn’t feel <sem-weak>snooty</sem-weak> in a bad way&mdash;they’ve agreed to a high dress code for reasons that seem justified to them. To them, it's just a normal, comfortable dress code&mdash;the way any dress code we agree with seems to us.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>When we don’t agree with the dress code, we often either resist it or don’t know how to conform to it&mdash;and either way, we feel out of place. We'll leave if we can, and won't want to return</p>
      
      
   <!--
    [cutexamples]   [add to low-ranking]
     <p>Sometimes people <em>don't</em> treat us as equals, and they see us as having a lower rank than themselves. In this case, they’ll try to set the dress code unilaterally, with little compromise.</p>
      
      <p>
          For instance, our boss’s boss may try to set the dress code without our input, even if the formality <callback>(“my name is Steven Alexander Charles III”)</callback> or informality <callback>(“heyhey, I’m Steve!”)</callback> seem weird or off-putting to us.
      </p>
 
    <p>Our reaction to this depends on how we feel about being ranked as lower than them. If we rank them higher than us, this will feel normal or justified &mdash;but if we <outcome-contrast>don't</outcome-contrast> rank them higher, it'll feel degrading.</p>
