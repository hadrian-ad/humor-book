    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">Dress codes are consistent patterns</h2>

  
  <p>At first glance, humor dress codes can seem arbitrary&mdash;but they're not. Humor dress codes change as the need for <em>efficiency</em> and <em>cohesion</em> change.</p> 
        
<div class="consider">
      <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>Our humor dress code is the minimum standard for the complexity and coherence of our interactions&mdash;and this standard is constantly changing as the emotional situation changes.</p>
  </div>
  
<p>When Trevor and Yasmin go camping, their humor dress code will change as the need for efficiency and cohesion changes:</p>
   

   <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor, Yasmin, and some friends are going camping. They’re trash-talking each other as they drive, having a good time.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a low dress code while passing time&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“Shut up everyone, the exit’s coming up. I need to hear the phone.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code while navigating&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>They arrive at the state park, and haul their bags out of the car.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a lower dress code doing menial tasks&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>They work together to assemble the tents. Someone reads the instructions while others try to get the poles aligned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code when working together to accomplish something&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Afterward they sit down to eat some food together at the picnic tables.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a lower dress code eating with friends&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Soon, other campers sit down at the picnic tables near them.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code eating around strangers&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
    
    <p>We can see this pattern in any comparative situations. The dress code changes based on our need for efficiency and cohesion:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>There’s a higher dress code when we’re at the register than when we’re at the back of the line</li>
    <li>There’s a higher dress code during the meeting than when the meeting has finished</li>
    <li>There’s a higher dress code when the teacher is explaining the assignment at the end of the period than when the teacher is welcoming the class at the beginning</li>
    <li>There’s a higher dress code when we’re making logistical plans with our friends than when we’re with our friends and eating a snack together</li>
    <li>There’s a higher dress code when something serious is happening in the movie than when something serious isn’t happening in the movie</li>
    </ul>
    
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>This means a dress code is like a filter: it <term>allows</term> humor or humor attempts that <term>promote</term> efficiency and cohesion&mdash;and <term2>filters out</term2> humor attempts that <term2>don't promote</term2> efficiency or cohesion.</p> 


<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>  
    
    <p>This is obvious when we think about emergencies, where the need for efficiency and cohesion increases. The increased dress code screens out humor or humor attempts that don't help people be efficient or cohesive&mdash;like long <sem-weak>knock, knock</sem-weak> jokes,  loud whooping laughter, and so on. <callback>("Quiet, I need to hear the instructions!")</callback></p> 

<p>Even though the higher dress code weeds out <term>some</term> humor or humor attempts, it doesn't make them <term2>all</term2> go away&mdash;since during emergencies we'd still want to feel we’re <humor-outcome>surviving stressful situations</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolizing close ties</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supporting arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, and so on. In a crisis especially, we'd want to feel <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on&mdash;just while not also hindering useful action. </p> 

</div>

 
<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Amount.</headline> The dress code doesn't predict how much humor there'll be. Our first impression might be that the higher the dress code, the less humor there is&mdash;but that’s not true to our experiences.</p> 
    
    <p>We can get dinner with a friend at a casual diner <callback>(low dress code)</callback> and still have a dead conversation <callback>(little humor)</callback>&mdash;since a low dress code doesn’t compel lively conversation.</p> 
     
    <p>Similarly, if we dress up and go to an art gallery with our friend <callback>(high dress code)</callback>, we can still smile and laugh <callback>(lots of humor)</callback>&mdash;since a high dress code doesn’t compel frowning and boredom.</p> 
    
    <p> A higher dress code just means we take more care in how we generate humor, which doesn’t always mean there’s <sem-weak>less</sem-weak> humor&mdash;it just means we take more care around humor.</p>
