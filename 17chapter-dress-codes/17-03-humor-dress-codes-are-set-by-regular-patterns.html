  <p>At first glance, humor dress codes can seem arbitrary. But they follow a regular pattern—the dress code increases or decreases as we prioritize efficiency and cohesion.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>  
    <p class="for-instance-text">The need for efficiency and cohesion goes up during an emergency—and so the humor dress code goes up too. The higher dress code screens out things that don’t help people be efficient or cohesive—like unfitted knock, knock jokes.</p>
    
    </div> 

<p class="for-instance-text">But the higher dress code doesn’t mean humor or humor attempts go away, since we’d still want to feel we’re surviving stressful situations, symbolizing close ties, supporting arguments, easing tension, and so on—and feel connection, insight, safety, and so on. These things are efficient and build cohesion—so a higher dress code allows these humor attempts , while weeding out less efficient or less cohesion-creating humor attempts.</p>

<p>The dress code shifts in response to the need for efficiency and cohesion:</p>

   <div class="vignette">
    <p><narrative>Trevor, Yasmin, and some friends are going camping. They’re trash-talking each other as they drive, having a good time.</narrative> <notes>(&larr;there’s a low dress code while passing time&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speaker>“Shut up everyone, the exit’s coming up. I need to hear the phone.”</speaker> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code while navigating&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narrative>They arrive at the state park, and haul their bags out of the car.</narrative> <notes>(&larr;there’s a lower dress code doing menial tasks&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narrative>They work together to assemble the tents. Someone reads the instructions while others try to get the poles aligned.</narrative> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code as working together to accomplish something&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narrative>Afterward they sit down to eat some food together at the picnic tables.</narrative> <notes>(&larr;there’s a lower dress code eating with friends&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narrative>Soon, other campers sit down at the picnic tables near them.</narrative> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code eating around strangers&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
    
    <p>We can see this pattern in any comparative situations. The dress code changes based on our need for efficiency and cohesion:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <ul>There’s a higher dress code when we’re at the register than when we’re at the back of the line</ul>
    <ul>There’s a higher dress code during the meeting than when the meeting has finished</ul>
    <ul>There’s a higher dress code when the teacher is explaining the assignment at the end of the period than when the teacher is welcoming the class at the beginning</ul>
    <ul>There’s a higher dress code when we’re making plans with our friends to meet up later than when we’re with our friends and not making any plans</ul>
    <ul>There’s a higher dress code when something serious is happening in the movie than when something serious isn’t happening in the movie</ul></ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>



 

<p><headline>Amount.</headline> Our first impression might be that the higher the dress code, the less humor there is. But that’s not true to our experiences—like how we can go get dinner with a friend and still have a dead conversation. The low dress code doesn’t compel lively conversation.</p> 
 
<p>Similarly, a high dress code doesn’t somehow suck humor from an experience. If we dress up and go to a formal gallery opening with our friend, we can still smile and laugh—the high dress code doesn’t compel frowning and boredom.</p> 

<p>The dress code doesn't predict how much humor there'll be. A higher dress code means we take more care in how we generate humor, which doesn’t always mean there’s less humor—it just means we take extra care.</p>
