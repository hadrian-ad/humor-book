    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor dress codes are set by regular patterns</h1>

  
  <p>At first glance, humor dress codes can seem arbitrary. But dress codes follow a regular pattern—they increases or decreases as we prioritize <sem>efficiency</sem> and <sem>cohesion</sem>:</p>

   <div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor, Yasmin, and some friends are going camping. They’re trash-talking each other as they drive, having a good time.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a low dress code while passing time&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <speech>“Shut up everyone, the exit’s coming up. I need to hear the phone.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code while navigating&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>They arrive at the state park, and haul their bags out of the car.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a lower dress code doing menial tasks&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>They work together to assemble the tents. Someone reads the instructions while others try to get the poles aligned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code when working together to accomplish something&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Afterward they sit down to eat some food together at the picnic tables.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a lower dress code eating with friends&harr;&#xFE0E;little need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Soon, other campers sit down at the picnic tables near them.</narration> <notes>(&larr;there’s a higher dress code eating around strangers&harr;&#xFE0E;greater need for efficiency and cohesion)</notes></p> 
    
    </div>
    
    <p>We can see this pattern in any comparative situations. The dress code changes based on our need for efficiency and cohesion:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>There’s a higher dress code when we’re at the register than when we’re at the back of the line</li>
    <li>There’s a higher dress code during the meeting than when the meeting has finished</li>
    <li>There’s a higher dress code when the teacher is explaining the assignment at the end of the period than when the teacher is welcoming the class at the beginning</li>
    <li>There’s a higher dress code when we’re making plans with our friends to meet up later than when we’re with our friends and not making any plans</li>
    <li>There’s a higher dress code when something serious is happening in the movie than when something serious isn’t happening in the movie</li>
    </ul>
    
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>



<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>  
    
    <p class="considertext">This is obvious when we think about emergencies. The need for efficiency and cohesion goes up during emergencies, which means the humor dress code goes up too. This higher dress code then screens out things that don't help people be efficient or cohesive&mdash;like long <sem-weak>knock, knock</sem-weak> jokes.</p> 

<p class="considertext">But the higher dress code doesn’t mean humor or humor attempts go <sem-weak>away</sem-weak>, since during emergencies we'd still want to feel we’re <humor-outcome>surviving stressful situations</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolizing close ties</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>supporting arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, and so on—and feel <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on. </p> 

<p class="considertext">A higher dress code allows humor or humor attempts that <term>promote</term> efficiency and cohesion&mdash;while <em>weeding out</em> humor attempts that don't promote efficiency or cohesion.</p> 
</div>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Amount.</headline> Our first impression might be that the higher the dress code, the less humor there is. But that’s not true to our experiences. We can go get dinner with a friend at a casual diner <callback>(low dress code)</callback> and still have a dead conversation <callback>(little humor)</callback>&mdash;since a low dress code doesn’t compel lively conversation.</p> 
     
    <p>Similarly, if we dress up and go to an art gallery with our friend <callback>(high dress code)</callback>, we can still smile and laugh <callback>(lots of humor)</callback>&mdash;a high dress code doesn’t compel frowning and boredom.</p> 
    
    <p>The dress code doesn't predict how much humor there'll be. A higher dress code just means we take more care in how we generate humor, which doesn’t always mean there’s <sem-weak>less</sem-weak> humor—it just means we take more care around humor.</p>
