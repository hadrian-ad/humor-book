<p>If a group becomes desynchronized, they'll try to become resynchronized. But first they'll have to decide which side to synchronize toward. <callback>(“Who is in the right?”)</callback></p> 

<p>We decide who to synchronize toward based on who seems to have greater justification&mdash;more fittedness.</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Jasper:</speaker> <action><action>*telling joke*</action></action> <speech>“… So they start trying to write a song. But they can’t get past the first two bars!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Audience:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Audience member:</speaker> <action>*groans*</action> <notes>(&larr;member censures audience or Jasper by not synchronizing with them)</notes></p> 
    </div>
    
<p>Above, the overall group will need to decide to synchronize toward Jasper or toward the groaner.</p>
           
<p>If Jasper’s audience feels the joke was <term>above</term> dress code, they’ll synchronize toward Jasper—but if the joke was <em>below</em> dress code, they’ll synchronize toward the groaner:</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">This will determine how Jasper reacts to the groaner too. If he agrees that his joke was unfitted, he’ll raise his hands in good-natured self-defense <callback>(synchronize toward groaner)</callback>. If his joke was fitted, he’ll put his hands on his hips in good-natured pushback <callback>(let the audience synchronize toward him)</callback>.</p> </div>

<p>If the emotion network refuses to synchronize, it fragments:</p>

    <p><headline>Satire.</headline> When something is well-fitted, we can’t effectively censure it. Everyone sees it as justified, and so they'll find our censure unpersuasive.</p> 
    
    <p>We sometimes feel this with satire. If it’s done well, we feel it’s beyond reproach:</p>
    
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Satire website headline:</speaker> <speech>“Nation’s 10-Year-Old Boys: ‘If You See Someone Raping Us, Please Call the Police’ (‘Doesn’t Matter Who, Doesn’t Matter Where,’ Children Say)”</speech></p>

        <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah. Covered up for ten years. The athletic director knew all along.”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“This site always nails it. I can’t believe they even have a news-related reason to write this.”</speech></p>

    <p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma implicitly agree that the justification for <term>tolerating</term> the humor attempt is greater than the justification for <em>censuring</em> it. When enough people feel this way, the satire can be widely shared and discussed—even when the content is upsetting or taboo.</p>
      
<!--        <p>Neither Zoe, Owen, nor Emma felt much humor in the example above—but humor attempts can have fittedness and be fitted whether or not anyone actually feels humor.</p> -->
