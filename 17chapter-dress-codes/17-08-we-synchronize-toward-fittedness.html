<p>When a group is desynchronized, they’ll try to resynchronize—but everyone will have to decide which side to synchronize toward. (“Who is in the right?”) We make this decision based on who seems to have greater justification.</p>


<p><speaker>Jasper:</speaker> <action><action>*telling joke*</action></action> <speech>“… So they start trying to write a song. But they can’t get past the first two bars!”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Audience:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Audience member:</speaker> <action>*groans*</action> <notes>(&larr;member censures audience or Jasper by not synchronizing with them)</notes></p> 

<p>If Jasper’s audience feels the joke was above dress code, they’ll synchronize toward Jasper—but if the joke was below dress code, they’ll synchronize toward the groaner.</p>

 

<p>This will determine how Jasper reacts to the groaner too. If he agrees that his joke was unfitted, he’ll raise his hands in good-natured self-defense (synchronize toward groaner). If his joke was fitted, he’ll put his hands on his hips in good-natured pushback (let the audience synchronize toward him).</p> 

<p>If the emotion network refuses to synchronize, it fragments:</p>

 

<p><narration>Jasper makes a joke that Sam feels is beyond the pale. At first, there are some titters of shocked laughter, then some groans.</narration> <notes>(&larr;desynchronization)</notes></p> 
 
<p><narration>Jasper doubles down with another joke in the same vein, which gets more groans, but some people laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;emotion network isn’t synchronizing)</notes></p>
 
<p><narration>Jasper keeps going, adding more slurs. People start leaving, and someone shouts at the stage.</narration> <notes>(&larr;emotion network fragments)</notes></p>

 

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*takes picture of a woman on a bench*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*catches him*</action> <internalaction>(scornfully)</internalaction> <speech>“Taking creep shots now, are we?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma censures Owen)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*turns red*</action> <speech>“It’s a nice picture that’s all.”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(meanly)</internalaction> <speech>“Huh. Nice set on her too. Are you sure that didn’t have anything to do with it? Maybe we should take a look at your phone to see!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma refuses to synchronize toward Owen, and censures him more)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(defensive)</internalaction> <speech>“What’s your problem? Like you’re some saint!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma and Owen are desynchronized)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*eyes flash*</action> <speech>“Is that the creep defense these days? Did you learn that line on some creep forum?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(frustrated)</internalaction> <speech>“I’m not a creep!”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Then delete it and don’t do it again!”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(angry)</internalaction> <internalaction>(retaliating)</internalaction> <speech>“You’re the one that fucking chased Sara off! Let’s ask her what advice you should be giving.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen refuses to synchronize toward Emma, and Emma refuses to synchronize toward Owen)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*goes back to her laptop*</action> <speech>“Fuck you.”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah. Fuck you too.”</speech> <action>*sulks off*</action> <notes>(&larr;emotion network fragments)</notes></p>





 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Satire.</headline> We can’t effectively censure something that is well-fitted—it’s understood to be justified. We sometimes feel this with satire. If it’s done well, we feel it’s beyond reproach:</p>
    
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Satire website headline:</speaker> <speech>“Nation’s 10-Year-Old Boys: ‘If You See Someone Raping Us, Please Call the Police’ (‘Doesn’t Matter Who, Doesn’t Matter Where,’ Children Say)”</speech></p> 
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*sees headline on feed*</action> <speech>“Ugh. Is this because that coach was in the news?”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah. Covered up for ten years. The athletic director knew all along.”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“This site always nails it. I can’t believe they even have a news-related reason to write this.”</speech></p>
    </div>
      
    
    <p>Neither Zoe, Owen, nor Emma felt much humor in the example above—but humor attempts can have fittedness and be fitted whether or not anyone actually feels humor.</p> 
    
    <p>Zoe, Owen, and Emma implicitly agree that the justification for tolerating the humor attempt is greater than the justification for censuring it. It doesn't really occur to them to try to censure the satirical article itself. When enough people feel this way, the satire can be widely shared and discussed—even when the content is upsetting or taboo.</p>
