<p>We can put everything together to look at a few examples:

<p>Above, there was disagreement on what the humor dress code should be, and so end up with different views on whether the subject line was fitted.</p>

    <p class="considertext">Justin has to juggle emails from all twenty-five students&mdash;Owen just has to juggle emails from one professor. It's not surprising they have different initial estimates of efficiency and cohesion needs.

<p>Tucker’s <term>pun</term> had a <term>low</term> fittedness, since it wasn't on relevant topics and wasn’t trying to reach humor family words. Amber only thought it was fitted when there was a low dress code.</p> 

<p>By contrast, Tucker’s <em>affirmation</em> had a <em>high</em> fittedness, since it was on relevant topics and was trying to make Amber feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>Because the affirmation had a high fittedness, Amber thought it fit the emotional situation <sem>whether or not</sem> there was a high or low dress code.</p>

<p>Sometimes we think there should be a flat dress code everywhere, and we're surprised when humor attempts are recieved differently in different places. We think a humor attempt that's good among friends should be good in a classroom or on a public social media profile.</p> 
    
<p>It's worth noticing that this gives a double standard for <sem>humor</sem> that other emotions don't have. We know that attempts to make others feel affection, anger, exuberance, frustration, guilt, pleasure, sadness, and so on are treated differently in different situations.</p> 
   
   
    
    <p>We're not surprised that an erotic photo or long rant are treated one way when shared in a lecture hall, and another when shared with our partner. And for similar reasons, we shouldn't be surprised when an erotic or angry <sem-weak>joke </sem-weak> is also treated one way in one place, and another way in another.</p>
           
 

  <p>Similary, it's not surprising that we encounter places with high dress codes&mdash;like advocacy organizations, charities, classrooms, international offices, big-tent political parties, public agencies, and so on. These all are goal oriented groups <callback>(need effectiveness)</callback> and have varied clients, customers, members, supporters, and so on <callback>(need cohesion)</callback>.</p>
                      
    <p>This means that our humor dress code goes up while actively participating in these groups, and goes down again when we’re not. They want to avoid pointlesly fragmenting the emotion networks associated with them, while at the same time promoting effective actions.</p>
    
    <p>From the outside looking in, we won't have the same need for efficiency or cohesion&mdash;and so we may criticize how their humor dress code seems to us, and feel it would be stifling to incorporate into our own lives. But this is a criticism without a foundation, since we're <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> supposed to incorporate those dress codes. They've been set for different needs than we have.</p>

<p>Humor or humor attempts need a minimum amount of fittedness to be fitted. However, this minimum amount is constantly changing. This changing minimum amount is the "humor dress code."</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    Humor dress codes change as our needs for <a href="17-03-humor-dress-codes-are-set-by-regular-patterns.html">efficiency and cohesion</a> change.</li>
    
<li>The humor dress code is the <a href="17-03-humor-dress-codes-are-set-by-regular-patterns.html">minimum standard for the complexity and coherence</a> of our interactions. This doesn't weed out humor, so much as weeds out the things that don't match the needs of the moment.</li>
    
<li>The humor dress code is set in <a href="17-05-the-final-dress-code-is-set-by-collaboration.html">collaboration</a> with everyone around us, but everyone doesn't always agree. When we don't agree, we use words like flippant or snooty to describe the dress code.</li>
