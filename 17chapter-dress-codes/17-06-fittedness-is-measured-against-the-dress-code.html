    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">Comparing fittedness to dress code</h2>
   
<p>We can put everything together to look at a few examples:
</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is browsing through the used bookstore for fun.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe doesn't need to be particularly efficient or cohesive&harr;&#xFE0E;browsing has low dress code)</notes></p> 
    
    <p><narration>She finds a book called <book-title>Ferdydurke</book-title>.</narration> <notes>(&larr;humor attempt with low fittedness)</notes></p> 
    <p><narration>She smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;low dress code and low fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;fitted humor)</notes></p>
    </div>

    alt="This dress code figure is labeled 'browsing' and shows a small bar that exceeds a very low dress code.";
    title="Dress code figure I";
    style="max-width: 20rem ; margin-left: 1rem" 
     >
    
    <div class="vignette">
    
    <p><narration>Owen is writing an email to Justin. For fun, he writes</narration> <speech>“He cries FERDYDURKE!”</speech> in the subject lines</p>
    
    <p><narration>Justin is amused and annoyed. Why doesn’t anyone ever read the email etiquette guidelines on the syllabus?</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen and Justin disagree on the humor dress code)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
    <img src=../images/17c-images-dress-codes/17-00-dress-codes/owen-justin-emailing.png

    style="max-width: ; margin-left: 2rem" 
     >
 
<p>Above, there was disagreement on what the humor dress code should be, and so end up with different views on whether the subject line was fitted.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Justin has to juggle emails from all twenty-five students&mdash;Owen just has to juggle emails from one professor. It's not surprising they have different initial estimates of efficiency and cohesion needs.

<p>Tucker’s <term>pun</term> had a <term>low</term> fittedness, since it wasn't on relevant topics and wasn’t trying to reach humor family words. Amber only thought it was fitted when there was a low dress code.</p> 

<p>By contrast, Tucker’s <em>affirmation</em> had a <em>high</em> fittedness, since it was on relevant topics and was trying to make Amber feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>Because the affirmation had a high fittedness, Amber thought it fit the emotional situation <sem>whether or not</sem> there was a high or low dress code.</p>
 
 
<div class="box"><p><headline>Context.</headline> Sometimes we're surprised that humor attempts are recieved differently in different places&mdash;we think there should be a flat dress code everywhere.</p> 
        
        <p>It's worth noticing that this gives a double standard for <sem-weak>humor</sem-weak> that we don't give to other emotions. We're not surprised that an erotic photo or a long rant are treated one way in one situation, and another way in another.</p> 
        
        <p>For the same reason, we shouldn't be surprised that jokes or humor attempts are treated differently in one situation than another.</p>

  <p>It's not surprising that there are places with high dress codes&mdash;like advocacy organizations, charities, classrooms, international offices, big-tent political parties, public agencies, and so on. These all are goal-oriented groups <callback>(need effectiveness)</callback> and have varied clients, customers, members, supporters, and so on <callback>(need cohesion)</callback>.</p>
                      
    <p>This means that our humor dress code goes <term>up</term> as we're interfacting with these groups, and goes <em>down</em> again when we’re not. These groups want to avoid pointlesly fragmenting the emotion networks associated with them, while at the same time promoting effective actions.</p>
    
    <p>From the outside looking in, we can feel a relative gap with their dress code&mdash;from the outside, <sem>we</sem> won't have the same need for efficiency or cohesion. This can make us criticize  their humor dress codes, and feel that they would be stifling to incorporate into our own lives.</p>
    
    <p>That's probably true! At the same time, we shouldn't judge humor dress codes by whether we should incorporate them into every situation. We're <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> supposed to incorporate those dress codes&mdash;they've been set for different needs than we have.</p> 

     <p>There may be good reasons to criticize an institution's humor dress code&mdash;but the fact that their dress code is different than our dress code at home by itself isn't a good reason.</p>

<p>Humor or humor attempts need a minimum amount of fittedness to be fitted. However, this minimum amount is constantly changing. This changing minimum amount is the "humor dress code."</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    Humor dress codes change as our needs for <a href="17-03-humor-dress-codes-are-set-by-regular-patterns.html">efficiency and cohesion</a> change.</li>
    
<li>The humor dress code is the <a href="17-03-humor-dress-codes-are-set-by-regular-patterns.html">minimum standard for the complexity and coherence</a> of our interactions. This doesn't weed out humor, so much as weed out the things that don't match the needs of the moment.</li>
    
<li>Humor dress codes are set in <a href="17-05-the-final-dress-code-is-set-by-collaboration.html">collaboration</a> with everyone around us. If not everyone agrees, words are used to describe the dress code like flippant or snooty.</li>
