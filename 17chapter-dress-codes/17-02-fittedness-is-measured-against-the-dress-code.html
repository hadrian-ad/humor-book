<p>Tucker’s pun had a low fittedness, since it was on irrelevant topics and wasn’t trying to reach humor family words. By contrast, Tucker’s affirmation had a high fittedness, since it was on relevant topics and was trying to make Amber feel <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>Because of this high fittedness, the affirmation fit the emotional situation whether or not there was a high or low dress code.</p>

    <p><headline>Formation.</headline> Dress codes are so omnipresent that they can be hard to notice. But dress codes are always around, everywhere—which is why we:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>encounter awkward pauses around the dinner table</li>
        <li>exchange looks with each other when the teacher makes an uncomfortable joke</li>
        <li>find random pointless stories from our spouse fun, but random pointless stories from the guy in the line in front of us annoying</li>
        <li>cringe when watching an uncomfortable scene in a comedy</li>
        <li>make eye contact with others when someone is weird in public</li>
        <li>share looks with passengers about someone laughing on the bus too loudly</li>
        <li>know who in the group everyone finds irritating</li>
        <li>register who is censuring who in a meeting
            find our post censured online by immediate consensus</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p>Humor dress codes are different than humor “guidelines” that we verbally discuss. Asking comedians to not make genocide jokes is a <term>guideline</term>—while the <em>dress code</em> is how an audience would actually respond to specific humor attempt with genocide content.</p>
