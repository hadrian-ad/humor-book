<p>When the woman finishes her song to applause, she feels <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>And while she <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>laughs</humor-tell> throughout, we can look beyond those for other humor tells too: she has <humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>flushes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>moves informally</humor-tell> with <humor-tell>informal posture</humor-tell> (swaying), <humor-tell>touches self</humor-tell> (hands clasped), <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> and <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focused on present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

<p>A soldier gives an ironic interview during an occupation of a city. When the camera pans to his audience, we see those soldiers feeling intense humor.</p> 

<p>The soldiers are staggered (<humor-tell>informal posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loose</humor-tell>, with <humor-tell>relaxed posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, and so on), with red faces (<humor-tell>flushing</humor-tell>) and <humor-tell>complete loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>. They at least briefly feel <humor-tell>optimism</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reduction of stress</humor-tell>, and feel <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>. They <humor-tell>touch each other</humor-tell>.</p> 

<p>These humor tells express humor family words: the audience feels <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>But because the humor tells are so intense, we'd say these humor family words were also correspondingly intense <callback>(intense <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, intense <emotions>release</emotions>, and so on)</callback>—and since their humor was such a long duration, we'd say that the mistake went against durable expectations. </p>

    <p>Note that just because we can describe the soldiers' humor as intense <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> (with the situation in this specific moment), we don't know how long this feeling will persist; what actions will be taken because of it; that we've accurately understood the context and active topics of the people in this video; and so on.</p>

<p>As the victorious wrestler stands, he <humor-tell>smiles</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>brightens</humor-tell>, has <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosens</humor-tell>, has <humor-tell>high energy</humor-tell> (relative to the other wrestler), has <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell> (relative to the other), has <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>socially tightens</humor-tell> (by moving closer to the other), and so on.</p> 

<p>The losing wrestler shows inverse humor tells—he curls his posture instead of <humor-tell>expanding</humor-tell> it, frowns instead of <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, turns from his opponent instead of <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> toward him, has lowered spirits instead of <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

<p>Since humor tells and humor family words are the same thing ("humor"), we can describe the victorious sumo as feeling <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on. Since he feels these things, he expresses humor tells.</p>

<p>By contrast, the losing sumo <outcome-contrast>doesn't</outcome-contrast> feel humor family words. Instead of <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, he feels <emotions>failure</emotions>; instead of <emotions>comfort</emotions>, he feels <emotions>discomfort</emotions>; instead of <emotions>joy</emotions>, he feels <emotions>grief</emotions>; instead of <emotions>release</emotions>, he feels <emotions>tension</emotions>; and so on.</p>

<p>We can also notice who else is showing humor in this scene—the crowd! They're showing humor tells and feeling humor family words more intensely than the victorious wrestler is in this clip. The crowd <humor-tell>expands their posture</humor-tell> by leaning back and extending their arms; <humor-tell>touch self</humor-tell> by clapping; cheer and <humor-tell>raise their voices</humor-tell>; <humor-tell>lose their sense of situational awareness</humor-tell> as they only focus on what's in front of them; and so on.</p>

<p>When we see many pictures of the same person, we start acclimating to their humor profile—their overall tendencies around how they express humor, which are particular to them:</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example">Method (Recall)</button>

<div class="content-example">

<p>One method of remembering someone's face is to remember them feeling humor. Since their humor profile is something that makes them them, it's an effective focal point for recall—someone's experience of <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, and so on make durable impressions on us.</p>
 
<p>Sometimes we try to recall a blank, "passport photo" memory of a face. But since we almost never see anyone blank-faced, this is a double task—not just remembering a face, but inventing an expression on it!</p>
   
<p>We can practice this method. Can we recall the faces of our seventh grade teachers by focusing on memories of them smiling? What about the coworkers at our first job? What about politicians from decades ago? How about our siblings at different ages?</p>

<p>The character makes a joke and doesn't smile. But we know she feels humor because we can look for humor tells beyond smiling: she glances toward the other characters (<humor-tell>social seeks</humor-tell>), gives a (light) <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, speaks quickly (<humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>), taps another character on his head (<humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>), swings her arms (<humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>), and breaks off the conversation (<humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell> relative to before the joke).</p>

<p>The above portrait is of some people living in the Russian Empire in 1914. We can use this picture to think about how humor tells are identifiably the same, even though humor tells are shaped by circumstances.</p>

<p>The men in the middle feel relatively intense humor—we can see this from their <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>expansive posture</humor-tell> <callback>(relative to the others)</callback>, <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell> <callback>(by crossing legs or putting hands in lap or on legs)</callback>, <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>brightened</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loose</humor-tell> <callback>(legs and arms)</callback>, and so on.</p>

<p>The one on the right feels the least humor relative to the others—he's not smiling, not touching self, has hunched (not expansive) posture, not brightening, has low energy, and so on.</p>

<p>These are all the same humor tells we use throughout this book. At the same time, these humor tells are also distinctive to a particular time and place&mdash;since physical aspects of our environment influence which humor tells we use when.</p>

<p>For instance, the backless bench doesn't allow them to slouch backward, so they <sem>can't</sem> lean back the way they might in a sofa or an armchair. And since it's a bench, they can sit close enough to link arms—which people are more likely to be doing if benches like this are common.</p>

<p>Similarly, their jackets discourage them from raising their arms—since they'd crumple and lift. If our clothing makes it harder for us to put our arms around someone's shoulders—like if we frequently wear dress frames, epaulets, puffy sleeves, or so on—we'll minimize putting arms around shoulders as a method of <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>.</p>

<p>By contrast, if we're just wearing t-shirts, it'll be easy to put our arms around someone's shoulder or waist—something we often see among sports teams, or how arms sometimes rest on shoulders at casual cookouts with simple clothing. 

<p>That means how we <humor-tell>touch others</humor-tell> depends on common furniture, what we and others frequently wear, and so on. If we grew up with backless benches and people wearing jackets, a certain way of  <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell> will become normal—like linking arms. If we grew up with individual chairs and simple, sleeveless clothing, we way may not.</p> 

<p>So the same humor tells (<humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social tightening</humor-tell>) takes on distinctive characteristics place-by-place, person-by-person, time-by-time—often influenced by clothing, manufacturing, resources, weather, and so on.</p>
