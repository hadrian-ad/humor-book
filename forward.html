<div class="about-box"><h1>Forward</h1>
    
    <p>Before I read <book-title>Humor in Various Moods and Meters</book-title> for the first time, I'll have to admit I was skeptical. The subtitle was <book-title>Instruction on Observing Smiles and Laughter</book-title>. Did I really need this instruction? Do you?</p> 
    
    <p>After reading this book several times&mdash;I can say that yes, we all need this instruction. Perhaps now more than ever.</p> 
    
    <p>I've guided several students of mine to this book, and each has attested to the same pleasing quality of  "surprising obviousness" to the observations in this book.</p> 
    
    <p>What this book does is invite readers to look again at patterns of smiling and laughing (what the author calls "humor"). After a well-paced guided tour, readers leave with the sticky sense that the world is more beautiful and elegant than we had grasped.</p>
    
    <p>I hope you find this sticky sense of beauty and elegance too.</p>
