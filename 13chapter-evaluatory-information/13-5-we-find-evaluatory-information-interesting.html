    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We find evaluatory information interesting</h1>
    
   
<p>We <term>generally</term> find evaluatory information to be inherently interesting and important. By contrast, we only <em>circumstantially</em> care about content information.</p>

<p>In the following pictures, there's nothing really interesting happening. Even so, we make a split-second glance at the people—because evaluatory information is inherently interesting to us:</p>

<p>But even though we find their emotion tells briefly interesting <callback>(evaluatory information)</callback>, we probably aren't tormented by unfulfilled curiosity about what they're thinking about <callback>(content information)</callback>—because content information is only of circumstantial interest to us.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">Even if the people in the picture above were deep in conversation, we probably still wouldn't care much about the content information. We may enjoy spending a second to see how people are reacting to things <callback>(evaluatory information)</callback> without giving a second thought to what they're talking about <callback>(content information)</callback>.</p> 
    </div> 


<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Raw data.</headline> We probably have sets of data that <term>do</term> interest us, but many more sets of data that <em>don't</em> interest us. That's because content isn't <em>inherently</em> interesting, unlike evaluatory information.</p> 
     
    <p>If a random person walked up holding up the data below, we'd check their face before checking the data. That's because most of the time we find evaluatory information interesting, but only circumstantially find content information interesting:</p>
    
    <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-5-evaluatory-information-is-interesting/13-5-2-example-data.png
    
        alt="";
        title="";
        style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
         >
    
    <p>Raw data doesn't communicate evaluatory information. <callback>("That table of raw data is feeling upset right now.")</callback> The data itself isn't expected or not expecting anything, nor does it have a sense of consequences—instead, people express evaluatory information at the data.</p> 
    
    <p>Of course, <term>people</term> can <em>present</em> data in a way that conveys their reactions—like by using an exclamation mark (!) or red font. But these are actions taken by <term>people</term> in order to <em>entwine</em> evaluatory information to content information.</p> 
    
    <p>Often, the data we find most interesting is already entwined with evaluatory information, or when we have the background to express evaluatory information on the data ourselves—because, again, we usually find evaluatory information more important than content information.</p>
