    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We find evaluatory information interesting</h1>
    
   
<p>We prioritize evaluatory information over content information. If someone shows us a sheet of raw data, we check their face first—because evaluatory information has priority over content information in most cases.</p>

<p>Similarly, we almost <term>always</term> want to know evaluatory information, even as we only <em>circumstantially</em> want to know about content information.</p>

<p>Of the pictures below, our eyes will probably glance and linger at the people <term>first</term> <callback>(we prioritize evaluatory information)</callback>, <em>before</em> we can give any real attention to the table of data. But even then, we probably won't care much about the content information <callback>(we only circumstantially care about content information)</callback>:</p>

<p>By prioritizing evaluatory information, we ensure that we everyone is sharing evaluations before doing anything else.</p> 


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">
         We probably find the evaluatory information of the people on the bench interesting for a split second. But we're probably not tormented by unfulfilled curiosity about what they're thinking about.</p>
     
    <p class="considertext">That's because we're only circumstantially interested in content information, which is why we find people watching enjoyable even though we'll never know much about the content behind their evaluations.</p> 
    </div> 


<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Raw data.</headline> Raw data doesn't communicate evaluatory information. <callback>("That table of raw data is feeling upset right now.")</callback> The data itself isn't expected or not expecting anything, and the data does not have a sense of consequences—instead, it's <term>people</term> who express evaluatory information at the data.</p> 
    
    <p>Of course, people can <em>present</em> data in a way that conveys their reactions—like by using an exclamation mark (!) or <colorred style="color: red">red font</colorred>. But these are actions taken by people in order to entwine evaluatory information to content information.</p> 
    
    <p>Often, the data we find most interesting is already entwined with evaluatory information, or else when we have the background to express evaluatory information toward the data ourselves—since we usually find evaluatory information more important than content information.</p>
