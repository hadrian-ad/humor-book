    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We find evaluatory information interesting</h1>
    
   
We find evaluatory information to be inherently interesting and important. By contrast, we only circumstantially care about content information.

This is why we make a split-second glance at the people in the picture below—because the evaluatory information is inherently interesting to us:



But even though we find their emotion tells briefly interesting (evaluatory information), we probably aren't tormented by unfulfilled curiosity about what they're thinking about (content information)—because content information is only of niche interest to us. 

> Consider:

 If the people in the picture above were deep in conversation, we probably still wouldn't care much about the content information. We may enjoy spending a second to see how people are reacting to each other (evaluatory information) without giving a second thought to what they're talking about (content information).
