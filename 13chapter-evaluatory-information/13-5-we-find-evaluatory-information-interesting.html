<p>We find evaluatory information to be inherently interesting and important. By contrast, we only circumstantially care about content information.</p>

<p>This is why we make a split-second glance at the people in the picture below—because the evaluatory information is inherently interesting to us:</p>



<p>But even though we find their emotion tells briefly interesting <callback>(evaluatory information)</callback>, we probably aren't tormented by unfulfilled curiosity about what they're thinking about <callback>(content information)</callback>—because content information is only of niche interest to us.</p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">If the people in the picture above were deep in conversation, we probably still wouldn't care much about the content information. We may enjoy spending a second to see how people are reacting to each other <callback>(evaluatory information)</callback> without giving a second thought to what they're talking about <callback>(content information)</callback>.</p>
