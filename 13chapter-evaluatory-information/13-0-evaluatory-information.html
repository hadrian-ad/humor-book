    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">13. Evaluatory information</h1>
    
<p>Last chapter, we talked about how our <a href="../12chapter-emotion-network/12-0-emotion-network.html#exclude-navigation">emotion networks</a> were how people shared information with each other.</p>

<p>But emotion networks share a particular kind of information: <vocab>evaluatory information</vocab>. This is information about mistakes and OKs:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Trevor sees General Zod run to the window and stand there stiffly at alert.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor receives information about Zod's mistakes and OKs)</notes>
</p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Minh looks at a row of people on the bus, each of who is staring at their phone. One has a wide smile of delight. One has a quiet smile. One is not smiling at all.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Minh receives information about passengers mistakes and OKs)</notes>
</p>
</div>


<p>Above, Minh can't see what people are looking at on their phones, so he doesn't know what people are evaluatingâ€”but he picks up on their evaluations of it anyway. </p>

<p>In other words, even though he doesn't know <term>what</term> they see <callback>(he doesn't have information about content)</callback>, he still knows how they <em>feel</em> about what they see <callback>(he does have information about evaluations)</callback>.</p>

<p>We'll be going over this in more detail throughout this chapter.</p>
