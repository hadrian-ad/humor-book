    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">13. Evaluatory information</h1>
    
<p>Last chapter we talked about how we link evaluations—our emotion networks.</p>

<p>We use emotion networks to share information about our evaluations:</p>

<div class="vignette">
Trevor sees General Zod run to the window and stand there stiffly at alert. (&larr;Trevor receives information about Zod's mistakes and OKs)
</div>



<div class="vignette">
Minh looks at a row of people on the bus, each of who is staring at their phone. One has a wide smile of delight. One has a quiet smile. One is not smiling at all. (&larr;Minh receives information about passengers mistakes and OKs)
</div>

<p>Above, Minh can't see what people are looking at on their phones, so he doesn't know what people are evaluating—but he picks up on their evaluations anyway. </p>

<p>In other words, even though he doesn't know what they see (he doesn't have information about content), he still knows how they feel about what they see (he does have information about evaluations).</p>

<p>That's because these are two different kinds of information. There's "content information" and "evaluatory information." Our emotion network shares evaluatory information only:</p>



<p>We'll be going over this in more detail throughout this chapter, which will help us make more sense of our emotional network.</p>
