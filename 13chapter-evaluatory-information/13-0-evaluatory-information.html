    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">13. Evaluatory information</h1>
    
<p>Last chapter we talked about how we link evaluations—our <a href="../12chapter-emotion-network/12-0-emotion-network.html#exclude-navigation">emotion networks</a>.</p>

<p>We use emotion networks to share information about our evaluations:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<narration>Trevor sees General Zod run to the window and stand there stiffly at alert.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor receives information about Zod's mistakes and OKs)</notes>
</div>



<div class="vignette">
<narration>Minh looks at a row of people on the bus, each of who is staring at their phone. One has a wide smile of delight. One has a quiet smile. One is not smiling at all.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Minh receives information about passengers mistakes and OKs)</notes>
</div>

<p>Above, Minh can't see <em>what</em> people are looking at on their phones, so he doesn't know what people are evaluating—but he picks up on their evaluations anyway. </p>

<p>In other words, even though he doesn't know what they see <callback>(he doesn't have information about content)</callback>, he still knows how they feel about what they see <callback>(he does have information about evaluations)</callback>.</p>

<p>That's because these are two different kinds of information. There's <vocab>content information</vocab> and <vocab>evaluatory information</vocab>. Our emotion network shares evaluatory information only:</p>

     >

<p>We'll be going over this in more detail throughout this chapter, which will help us make more sense of our emotional network.</p>
