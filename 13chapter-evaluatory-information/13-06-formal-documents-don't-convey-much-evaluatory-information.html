    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Formal writing conveys less evaluatory information</h1>
    
   
<p>Between writing formally and informally, writing <term>informally</term> usually conveys <em>more</em> information:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*texting*</action> <speech>"did you get groceries lmaoo"</speech> <notes>(&larr;informal writing)</notes></p>

    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*texting*</action> <speech>"Did you get groceries?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;formal writing)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Trevor looks at the text and wonders: Is she blaming him, laughing at him, happy that he got her groceries, upset, or...?</narration> <notes>(&larr;the formal writing was less clear to Trevor than the informal writing)</notes></p>

       <p>Without evaluatory information, even grammatically straightforward sentences can be ambiguous. <callback>("Did you get groceries?")</callback></p> 
       
       <p>That's because we interpret sentences with evaluatory information. When this evaluatory information is stripped, it's harder to interpret sentences&mdash;we find them ambiguous.</p>
       
     <p>It's not until we add evaluatory information to sentences that ambiguity decreases. <callback>("lmaoo")</callback></p>

<p>Even though the <term>content</term> information was the <em>same</em> in both <callback>(Emma got into the conference)</callback>, the amount of <term>evaluatory</term> information was <em>less</em>. <callback>(How Emma felt about getting into the conference)</callback>.</p> 

<p>Emma's formal writing <callback>("My paper was accepted into the conference")</callback> doesn't specify whether she's amused, bored, thrilled, horrified, and so on. It's the <term>informal</term> writing fit <em>more</em> information in the same amount of space than the formal writing.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class=considertext>Formal writing tends to minimize evaluatory information. This doesn’t mean <term>readers</term> don’t <em>create</em> their own evaluatory information in response to formal writing—it just means the <term>documents</term> themselves don't <em>convey</em> much evaluatory information.</p> 
    
    </div>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Density.</headline> Formal writing struggles to convey evaluatory information. This is one reason descriptions of humor are so stilted in formal documents—they avoid oral words like “funny”; transliterations of laughter <callback>(“hurhh!”)</callback>; exclamation marks; and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Instead, we get relatively lifeless phrases like <callback>“laughter was heard,” “the comment was met with derision,” the speaker entertained the audience for an hour,”</callback> and so on. This formal language doesn’t record much evaluatory information about duration, intensity, frequency, or whether the humor tilted toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance.</p>
    
    <p>By contrast, informal writing <term>wants</term> to increase evaluatory information—since we use informal writing to group and efficiently share information over our emotion network. This is why informal writing constantly incorporates abbreviations, acronyms, colors, emoticons, emojis, filters, font, formatting, meme formats, repeat letters, timing standards, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This is often most noticeable when it comes to humor. Informal writing uses words like <callback>lol, lolz, lololololol, lmaoo, rofl, roflmao,</callback> and so on—which add precision and nuance to the evaluatory information in a way that we can’t do as quickly or efficiently in formal writing.</p>
