    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can know someone's evaluations without knowing what they're evaluating</h1>
    
   
<p>In this book, there are two kinds of information:</p> 

<ol class="close-list"><li>
    <term>Content information</term> <callback>(what)</callback>
</li>
    
     <li>
         <em>evaluatory information</em> <callback>(how we feel about it)</callback>
     </li>
    </ol>
<p>In the picture below, we don't know what the dog <term>sees</term> <callback>(content information)</callback>â€”but we <sem>do</sem> know how it <em>feels</em> about what it sees <callback>(evaluatory information)</callback>:</p>

    <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-1-we-can-know-evaluations-without-content/13-1-0-dog.png


    alt="This image shows a dog at alert at a window, look out. We can't see what it sees. Underneath is an evaluation graph, with a question mark for a label, with an annotation saying 'we don't know what the dog sees, but we know how it feels about it' with the evaluations tracked on the graph.";
    title="Evaluatory information";
    style="max-width: 30rem; margin-left: 1rem " 
     >

<p>Similarly, we don't know <term>what</term> people are reacting to below <callback>(content information)</callback>, but we do know <em>how</em> they are reacting <callback>(evaluatory information)</callback>:</p>

    <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-1-we-can-know-evaluations-without-content/13-1-1-sad.png
    
    alt="This pictures shows a group of sad people, with a woman wiping her eyes and another watching he sadly. They are dressed in odd clothes. Underneath is an evaluatory graph, with a question mark for a label annotated with 'we don't know what the people are reacting to (content information), but we know how they feel about it (evaluatory information) with an arrow pointed at the evaluations tracked on the graph.";
    title="Evaluatory information II";
    style="max-width: 30rem ; margin-left: 1rem;" 
     >


<p>The reverse can also happen, where we can know <term>content</term> information without knowing <em>evalatory</em> information.</p>

<p>Below, if we know someone is looking at the rock, we'll know <term>what</term> they're reacting to <callback>(content information)</callback>, but not <em>how</em> they are  reacting <callback>(evaluatory information)</callback>:</p>


    <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-1-we-can-know-evaluations-without-content/13-1-2-boulder.png

    alt="This image shows a large rock in a streetscape. A drawing indicates someone is looking at the rock off-camera. Underneath is an evaluation graph, only this time the label is filled in as 'rock', and the evaluations in the graph have a question mark. Annotations say 'we know what someone is looking at (we have content information), but we don't know how they feel about it (we don't have evaluatory information.)";
    title="Evaluatory information III";
    style="max-width: 30rem ; margin-left: " 
     >


   <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Units.</headline> We have units of distance <callback>(miles)</callback> and units of time <callback>(hours)</callback>&mdash;and while we can put them together <callback>(miles per hour)</callback>, we can't treat them as the same thing. <callback>(1 mile + 1 hour &#8800; 2 miles.)</callback> That's because time and distance are seperate kinds of things for day-to-day thinking.</p>
    
    <p>We can think of "evaluatory information" and "content information" similarly&mdash;like two different kinds of things. Like miles per hour, these units are often used together&mdash;but just because they often go together doesn't mean there's only <term>one</term> thing there: there's actually <em>two</em>.</p>
