<p>We exchange evaluatory information with lightning speed on our emotion network:</p>

<p>Multiple people can survey each other's emotional state in just a few seconds. This is a huge amount of information, shared very quickly!</p> 

<p>To see how efficient and dense this exchange of information is, we can compare sitauations—like when Emma, Zoe, Owen, Minh, and Trevor are:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
       <li>all in the <term>same</term> room and take two seconds to <term>glance</term> at each other <callback>(full emotion network)</callback></li>
    <li>are all in <em>different</em> rooms and take two seconds to try to <em>text</em> their reaction to each other <callback>(constrained emotion network)</callback></li>
        </ul>

<p>In the first case, it would take two seconds for everyone to convey their own opinion, while also gathering the nuanced stance of everyone involved.</p>

<p>In the second case, it would take two seconds to barely type two words, let alone also learn much about everyone else's emotional state.</p>

<p>A full emotion network, where we have access to all of someone's emotion tells, shares evaulatory information very quickly.</p>


<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Constraint.</headline> An emotion network is accessed with degrees of fullness—that is, what proportion of emotion tells we have access to. So if we're talking to someone, we have access to all their emotion tells <callback>(full emotion network)</callback>, but if we're just looking at a static picture, we don't have full access <callback>(constrained emotion network)</callback>.</p>
    
    <p>The more constrained an emotion network is, the less evaluatory information it has. So being around an angry man has the most evaluatory information—seeing a picture of him has less—and just reading a snippet of an article <callback>("he was incensed")</callback> has the least evaluatory information.</p>
