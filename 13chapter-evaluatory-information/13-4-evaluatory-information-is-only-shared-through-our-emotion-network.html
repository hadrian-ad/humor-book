<p>Our emotion network is lightning fast at exchanging evaluatory information:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Emma, Zoe, Owen, Minh, and Trevor are in the library working on a group project for Justin’s class.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker><speech> "Okay."</speech> <action>*reads assignment aloud*</action> <speech>"‘Imagine Joseph Conrad and Robert Browning are teenagers in an American university and are debating the merits of 21st century Literary Modernism compared to 19th century Literary Exceptionalism.

</div>

<p>Multiple people can survey each other's emotional state in just a few seconds. This is a huge amount of information!</p> 

<p>To see how efficient and dense this exchange of information is, we can compare two scenarios—like when Emma, Zoe, Owen, Minh, and Trevor:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
       <li>are all in the <term>same</term> room and take two seconds to <term>glance</term> at each other <callback>(full emotion network)</callback></li>
    <li>are all in <em>different</em> rooms and take two seconds to try to <em>text</em> their reaction to each other <callback>(constrained emotion network)</callback></li>
        </ul>

<p>In the first case, it would take two seconds for everyone to convey their own opinion while also gathering the nuanced stance of everyone involved.</p>

<p>In the second case, they'd all barely be able to type two words in two seconds, let alone also learn much about everyone else's emotional state.</p>

<p>That's because evaluatory information is shared most efficiently on a full emotion network. Varying from a full emotion network—like by texting—always reduces how much evaluatory information is shared.</p>


<div class="box">
    <headline>Access.</headline> An emotion network is accessed with degrees of fullness—that is, what proportion of emotion tells we have access to. So if we're talking to someone, we have access to all their emotion tells <callback>(full emotion network)</callback>, but if we're just looking at a static picture, we don't have full access <callback>(constrained emotion network)</callback>. 
    
    The more constrained an emotion network is, the less evaluatory information it has. So being around an angry man has the most evaluatory information—seeing a picture of him has less—and just reading a snippet of an article that says <speech>"he was incensed"</speech> has the least evaluatory information.
