    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Words and emotions fill different roles</h1>
    

<p>At this point, we can think about what words do, and what emotions do. They work together, but fill different roles:</p>

 
<h2 style="margin-bottom: .5rem">What emotions do</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <p > We use emotion tells to share evaluatory information—and emotion tells share this with much greater information density than words do alone. This is obvious whenever we look at a transcription of a typical conversation:
        
         </p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
      <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Emma… Emma… is the… uh. Is the…”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“The… the thing…”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“No, the other…, uh…”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Um. Mm. I think it’s…”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Later…”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah. February, or something. I, uh, can check.”</speech></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“No, it’s—it’s good.”</speech></p> 
        </div>
    
     
    
    <p >When we transcribe day-to-day conversation into just words, we strip the conversation of most of the emotion tells—which also strips the conversation of most of its information!
        </p>
    
                       <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-8-words-emotions/13-8-0-what-emotions-do.png
    
        alt="Thes information quantity figure has two rows, 'face-to-face' and 'transcription.' Transcription has less evaluatory information. An annotation to the face-to-face evaluatory information says 'emotions are evaluatory information.'";
        title="Information quantity figure";
        style="max-width: 23rem ; margin-left: " 
         >
     
    
    <p >To see how much information has been stripped, we can notice that we don’t even know whether Zoe was angry, amused, confused, crushed, bored, eager, excited, happy, hopeful, indifferent, nervous, sad, thoughtful, wistful, and so on—or in what combination, at which moments.</p>
</div>

 
<h2 style="margin-bottom: .5rem">What words do</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <p>We use words (or indications, pictures, or so on) to activate specific topics in combination or sequences—even if those topics are distant, fictional, future, past, surreal, and so on. This ensures we're synchronized on active topics with someone. </p>
    
     
    
    <p >Once we're synchronized on active topics, we know what our emotion tells are communicating about:
        </p>
    
    
                       <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-8-words-emotions/13-8-1-nucleus-dinosaurs.png
    
        alt="This nuclueus figure has the topic 'dinosaur,' which then becomes surrounded by broader evaluatory information. A note says 'because of speech we know this evaluatory information is about dinosaurs.'";
        title="Nucleus figure";
        style="max-width: 34rem; margin-left: " 
         >
    
    
    
    <p >If there were dinosaurs around, Emma and Zoe could simply point to them to synchronize their active topics. But words allow them to synchronize around these topics even when dinosaurs <sem-weak>aren't</sem-weak> around! </p>
    
     
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">Words let them stay on the same page when exchanging evaluatory information. So if Emma mentions a dinosaur and Zoe grins, Emma can sort Zoe's evaluatory information into the 'dinosaur' bin.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">But if Zoe just grins out of the blue, Emma won't know which bin to sort this evaluatory information into—at least, not without words.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    
    <p>The topic 'dinosaur' isn't that complicated to convey without words—since we can act them out, draw them, point at a picture, and so on. But this gets harder as soon as we start chaining topics together, like 'keeping dinosaurs as pets.'</p>
    
    
    
    <p><term>Without</term> words, it's hard for Emma to get Zoe to synchronize over the topic 'keeping dinosaurs as pets.' But it's easy <em>with</em> words—Emma just says: <callback>"How awesome would it be to have a dinosaur as a pet?"</callback> and then takes in Zoe's reaction.</p>
    
        <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-8-words-emotions/13-8-2-nucleus-dinosaur-pets.png
    
        alt="This nucleus figure expands on the previous figure. Instead of just the topic 'dinosaurs,' there's also the topic 'pets.' They connect together and recieve a circle of evaluatory information. An annotation to the evaluatory information circle says 'because of speech we know this evaluatory information is about dinosAur pets.";
        title="Nucleus figure II";
        style="max-width: 34rem ; margin-left: " 
         >
</div>

 

 <h2 style="margin-bottom: .5rem">What words and emotions do together</h2>
<div class="h2">
    
    <p >In this sense, emotions are like a fire hydrant of information. Emotions have a lot of informational volume&mdash;but making use of that volume depends on on words to direct that information somewhere specific.</p>
    
     
    
    <p >We can see Emma do this below: she uses words to activate specific combinations of topics, which lets her and Zoe share evaluatory information on those topics specifically:</p>
    
     
    
    <div class="vignette">
       <p><narration>Emma and Zoe are watching cars from a bench.</narration></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Remember Mr. Myrtle?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma uses speech to activate an old topic)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(angry)</internalaction> <speech>“Yes.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe uses their emotional network to share evaluatory information on that topic)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Remember Mrs. Goldberg?</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma uses speech to activate another topic)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(happy)</internalaction> <speech>“Yeah!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe uses their emotional network to share evaluatory information on that topic)</notes></p>
        
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“They got married!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma uses speech to combine and introduce topics)</notes></p>
        
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(confused)</internalaction> <speech>“No!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe uses their emotional network to share evaluatory information on that topic)</notes></p>
        
        </div>
    
                       <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-8-words-emotions/13-8-3-topics-words.png
    
        alt="This topic figure has three columns, one for 'Mr. Myrtle,' Mrs. Goldberg,' and 'change in their relationships' We can see different topics be activated, and the corresponding change in Zoe's emotional state box. When all three topics are active, Zoe has a complex emotional state box, with an annotation that says 'Zoe's emotional state is evaluatory information in their emotion network.'";
        title="Topic figure";
        style="max-width: 36rem ; margin-left: " 
         >
    
      
    
    <p >Emma used words to synchronize their active topics, which lets them share evaluatory information on the same thing. But even though the words were necessary for this kind of control over topics, the majority of the information that was communicated was actually done over the emotion network.
        </p>
     
    
    <p >This is obvious when we count the words: Emma spoke nine words, and Zoe spoke three. That's not a lot of words! Emma's words were <term>necessary</term> to topicalize the evaluatory information—but at the same time, the words themselves were an <em>insignificant</em> amount of the total information communicated with each other.</p>
</div>

<p>This helps us see how words and emotion tells work together to be exponentially more useful together than when apart. It also helps us avoid giving too much weight to the role that words play by themselves in our day-to-day lives. </p>

<p>This is important when it comes to thinking about humor. Humor isn't something about <term>words</term> per se&mdash;humor is an <term>emotion</term>. It’s based on <em>evaluations</em> of content, not the <em>content</em> itself. In interactions, it’s this sharing and synchronizing of evaluations that makes interpersonal humor possible. </p>

    <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-8-words-emotions/13-8-4-humor-is-here.png

    alt="This generic information quantity figure has a bar for content information and a bar for evaluatory information. An annotation to the evaluatory information bar says 'humor is here'";
    title="Information quantity figure.";
    style="max-width: 16rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>This gives us context for the rest of this book. Getting better at humor isn’t really about getting better at words—it means getting better at emotions.</p>



<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Sophistication.</headline> Even though humor is an emotion, we sometimes think of humor as a skill of <term>rhetorical</term> sophistication. But it’s not—humor is better thought of as a skill of <em>emotional</em> sophistication.</p> 
   
    <p>This is obvious whenever we look at what makes people laugh outside of spectator entertainment. Most of the time, it’s not beautiful or clever speech. Often, the speech has no special qualities at all—in fact, the coherence of our speech usually <sem>declines</sem> when we’re feeling intense. But since humor isn’t rhetorical sophistication, the coherence of our speech is often neither here nor there to how much humor two friends can make each other feel.</p>   
    
    <p>Our verbal communication activates certain topics, which partially constructs someone’s evaluatory state. From there, we shift mistakes and OKs into humor—an activity that’s much broader and subtler than “good speech.” It’s instead something much more intricately linked to evaluations and synchronization, and requires emotional sophistication to do well.</p></div>

    A deeper look (Animal humor)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">
   
   <p>All social animals feel humor. At first, it can seem weird to say this outright, without any hedging&mdash;but it's mainly weird if we only think that humor is about jokes, satire, wit, resolving existential tension through art, and so on.</p> 
   
   <p>Other animals don’t appreciate puns in comedic movies like we do&mdash;but just because animals don't appreciate comedic movies doesn't mean they don't feel humor.</p> 
   
   <p><sem-weak>Babies</sem-weak> can’t appreciate comedic movies either—but we still say they feel humor <callback>(they smile and laugh)</callback>, even though no five-month-old has ever written a script or made a witty comment. That’s because we intuitively know that humor is something separate from verbal language.</p>

<p>In the same vein, it wouldn’t make sense to say animals don’t feel humor either&mdash;just because they don’t laugh at comedic dialogue or make witty comments.</p> 

<p>Our model of humor applies fairly well to non-human animals:</p>



<h2>Mistakes and OKs</h2> 
 
<div class="h2">
    <p>Animals feel humor when the size of their mistakes and OKs balance. When those don’t balance, they feel mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotions instead:</p>
    
     
    
    <p><strong>mistake-predominant emotions</strong></p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p>
            <narration>Trevor shouts as he loses an online match. General Zod looks up, startled.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes>
        </p> 
        <p>
            <narration>Zod is worried.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is not OK)</notes> <narration>He puts his head on his paws and he glances around, concerned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is larger than OK&harr;mistake-predominant emotions)</notes>
        </p>
    </div> 
    
     
    
    <p><strong>balanced emotions</strong></p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor shouts as he loses a match. General Zod looks up, startled.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake)</notes> <narration>Zod sees everything’s fine.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is OK)</notes> <narration>He relaxes and wags his tail.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is OK&harr;<emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
    </p> </div>
    
     
    
    <p><strong>OK-predominant emotions</strong></p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p>
            <narration>Trevor shouts as he loses a match. General Zod doesn’t even register it.</narration> <notes>(&larr;no mistake)</notes> <narration>Trevor does this every night.</narration> <notes>(&larr;OK is larger than mistake&harr;OK-predominant emotions)</notes>
        </p>
    </div>  
    
    
    
    <p>We see similar things with any social animal:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>apes investigate things</li>
        <li>bear cubs wrestle with each other</li>
        <li>cats play with mice</li>
        <li>crows try to pull animal tails</li>
        <li>dogs see people return early</li>
        <li>dolphins explore novelty</li>
        <li>elephants perform pranks</li>
        <li>fawns explore fields</li>
        <li>monkeys observe behavior</li>
        <li>otters push things around</li>
        <li>parrots are mischievous</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    
    <p>In all these cases, other animals have the same forking outcomes we do: sometimes the mistake is too large, and they become defensive—other times the OK is too large, and they get bored. When the mistake and OK balance, they feel humor.</p>
</div>

 

<h2>Generating humor</h2> 
 
<div class="h2">
    <p>Animals intentionally try to generate humor&mdash;we already have words for this, like “play.” An animal that’s playing is intentionally enlarging mistakes or shrinking an OK to generate humor.</p>
    
     
    
    <div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
        <p class="for-instance-text">When fawns have a large OK, they’ll prance to create large mistake and generate humor. Cats will intentionally generate humor by playing with mice or string. “Playing” is a context-specific word for trying to generate humor.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Like in humans, humor in other animals indicates the Goldilocks experiential zone&mdash;not too much mistake, not too much OK. When intentionally pursued <callback>("play")</callback>, it’s the sweet spot where we’re pushing something while also mitigating risk. Humor is part of how we communicate our relation to this sweet spot to others.</p>
    
    <div class="for-instance">
     
     <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
     
     <p class="for-instance-text">When bear cubs, dog puppies, or human kids wrestle, they’ll use humor to calibrate themselves into this Goldilocks zone. Too much mistake, and they’ll slow up. Too much OK, they’ll go a bit harder. Their emotion network helps them arrive at the place between too consequential and not consequential enough—which is how we play.</p></div>
    
     
    
    <p>Other times, animals don't intentionally generate humor, but their humor "rings" like a convenience store bell, signaling their transition between mistake-predominant and OK-predominant emotions—like how General Zod is first startled by Trevor <callback>(mistake-predominance)</callback>, and then transitions back to being placid <callback>(OK-predominance)</callback>. Zod has to "ring" through humor to make this transition, maybe with a brief tail wag.</p>
</div>




 

<h2>Humor family words</h2> 

<div class="h2">
    <p>We can use humor family words to think about where animals feel humor. For instance, dogs and cats feel humor when they feel:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
    
    <li>
        <emotions>achievement</emotions> <callback>(successful hunting)</callback>
    </li> 
    <li>
        <emotions>appreciation</emotions> <callback>(petting)</callback>
    </li>

<li><emotions>comfort</emotions> <callback>(warmth)</callback>
      </li>  
    <li><emotions>connection</emotions> <callback>(attention)</callback>
           </li> 
    <li>
            <emotions>generosity</emotions> <callback>(treats)</callback>
      </li>
      
        <li>
            <emotions>relief</emotions> <callback>(removal of something stressful)</callback>
        </li>
        
         <li>
               <emotions>welcome</emotions> <callback>(inviting a dog up on furniture)</callback>
          </li>
          </ul>
          
            <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
</div>



<h2>Humor tells</h2> 

<div class="h2">
    <p>Social animals have humor tells too. They'll consistently show humor tells when mistakes are OK, like by:</p> 
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>seeking out other animals</li>
        <li>touching each other</li>
        <li>making contented noises</li>
        <li>making loud noises </li>
        <li>losing awareness of what’s around them</li>
        <li>moving non-normatively</li>
        <li>becoming bolder</li>
        <li>relaxing</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
</div>

 

<h2>Humor profiles</h2> 
 
<div class="h2">
    <p>Each species has their own <term>species</term> humor profile. Within that template, each member of that species has their own <em>individual</em> humor profile.</p>
    
    
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
          <p class="for-instance-text">This is like how all dogs wag their tails, but each dog wags their tail a bit differently.</p>
    </div>    
     
    
    <p>Animal humor profiles don’t usually look much like a human humor profile. While <term>dogs</term> can emote in ways that have nuance to us, <em>cats</em> are less readable to us&mdash;and <sem>crows</sem> even less so.</p>
    
    <p>Of course, our inability to read the emotional state of a crow doesn't mean other crows have the same inability. And the more we watch or interact with crows <callback>(or cats or dogs)</callback>, the more evaluatory information we can pull from them.</p>
</div>



<h2>Emotion networks</h2> 
 
<div class="h2">
    <p>Social animals have emotion networks so they can form groups and share evaluatory information with each other.</p>
    
     
    
    <div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
         
         <p class="for-instance-text"> Crows will spread out across a field to eat—and if one crow notices a mistake, the others pick up on this too through their emotional network.</p> 
         
         <p class="for-instance-text">If many crows are anxious, but one becomes calm, the others will calm down too. If they can’t synchronize, they squabble.</p>
    </div>
    
     
    
    <p>In this case, humor isn’t some exceptional side-development that exists apart from “normal” function&mdash;humor is just part and parcel of an emotion network. Humor is like one frequency of how animals communicate evaluatory information.</p>
</div>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible-example">
    
    Example (Crows)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">

  <p>We can apply everything in the interval to a video of crows trying to pull a dog's tail:</p> 
   
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NstPHbrOsos?si=og-s6KFdBAP3NNxN&amp;start=21&amp;end=81" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
   
   <p>This is an activity with mistakes and OKs. Sometimes the mistakes are larger, and the crows feel mistake-predominant emotions—sometimes the OK is larger, and they feel OK-predominant emotions. We'll see them cycling through these states throughout this video.</p>

<p>We can think of the crows as intentionally trying to generate humor. <callback>("Play.")</callback> They're trying to find the Goldilocks experiential zone where there's not too much mistake, not too much OK. The sweet spot is where they feel they're experiencing novelty while also mitigating risk. Their emotion network helps them find this spot by sharing information about mistakes and OKs.</p>

<p>Unlike dogs, crows don't have humor tells that we find easy to read. Each individual crow would have its own humor profile drawn from a "crow humor profile" that's opaque to us, doubly so without strong familiarity with crows. But when described abstractly, we still can see humor tells in this video, like <humor-tells>energy</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>informal movement</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>loosening</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>reduction of physical tension</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>efforts to spread humor</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>fast thinking</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>focusing on present</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>increased agency</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>loss of overall situational awareness</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>non-normative behavior</humor-tells>, <humor-tells>social tightening</humor-tells>, and so on.</p>

<p>We'd expect the crows to express these humor tells as they transition between mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotional states—which we often describe through humor family words.</p>

<p>We use humor family words to characterize their motivations as well: they want to feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on. Like humans, we can prompt feelings of <emotions>relief</emotions> or <emotions>safety</emotions> by intentionally creating danger and transitioning out of it.</p>

<p>Finally, we can use the rest of our model of humor to contextualize their emotional situation. How intense is this humor? How long is its duration? Is it mostly humor, or a much more complicated emotional state? Is the dog feeling humor, or no?</p>

<p>This helps us think through animal behavior in a way inclusive to humor—without becoming stuck on the absence of elements from human humor profiles, like the lack of smiling, laughing, literary puns, and so on. Humor allows for quick, intuitive explanations of some behavior, and helps us avoid feeling bewildered. <callback>("what are these crows doing?")</callback></p>
   
    </div>

<p>Even though our model applies relatively well to all social animals, it’s sometimes still uncomfortable to say outright that non-human animals feel humor. We might worry that it’s anthropomorphizing them in ways that aren’t useful.</p> 

<p>It’s worth noticing that, whatever the merits of that concern, it puts a double standard on <sem>humor</sem> that we don’t for other emotions. Since humor is just a normal, regular emotion, it's no more or less weird to say animals feel <term>humor</term> as it is to say they feel <em>fear</em>.</p> 

<p>In our day-to-day lives, we acceptably describe animals as feeling <emotions>afraid, anxious, bored, curious, playful, lonely, sad, social, stressed,</emotions> and so on. We should also see <emotions>humor</emotions> as as acceptable a day-to-day way of describing animal emotions&mdash;whatever uncertainty we have in precise contexts about what animals are "really" feeling. <callback>(“How similar is cat stress to human stress?”)</callback></p>

<p>The wider point to all this isn’t actually about <term>animals</term>, but about <em>us</em>—and how we think about humor. When we understand how humor can sensibly apply to animals—even though they can’t tell jokes—we’re ready to more deeply understand how humor applies to us in our lives.</p>

<p>Humor is part of a broader system, where communication, evaluations, groups, and senses all relate together. It allows us to make assessments about the world around us, and quickly communalize those assessments&mdash;something that allows groups to form and to function well.</p> 

<p>In that light, it’s not surprising that social animals would have similar ways of sharing information together, whether those animals are humans or crows&mdash;including through humor.</p>

<p>To a greater degree than other animals, humans combine their emotion network with a complementing system of language, which allows us to topicalize our evaluatory information. Even though this gives a distinctive layer to our interactions relative to other animals, the foundation is still a similar system that exists for similar reasons among all social animals.</p>
