    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Content and evaluations are distinct</h1>
    
   
<p>We sometimes think <term>content</term> information and <em>evaluatory</em> information always travel together, but they don't.</p> 

<p>This is obvious once it's pointed out:</p>
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma is sniffling on the bus from sadness, her eyes red. The people around her are aware that she’s sad.</narration> <notes>(&larr;strangers can pick up on Emma’s evaluatory information, but not the content Emma is evaluating)</notes></p>
    
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
 <p><narration>Zoe is on a plane to Brazil. She looks up at the movie playing a few seats ahead of her. It's just a close-up of a man's face reacting to things off-screen. She has no idea of the context.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe can pick up on actor's evaluatory information, but not the content he's evaluating)</notes></p>
 </div>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Minh and his uncle talking about music and smiling and laughing. Minh’s baby nephew smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;baby can pick up on evaluatory information, but not content information)</notes></p>
     </div>
     
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe watches people chatter animatedly on the sidewalk several stories below.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe can pick up on evaluatory information, but not the content information they’re evaluating)</notes></p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>General Zod continues to stand at alert. Trevor keeps an eye on him staring out the window. He must really see something unusual out there.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor can pick up on General Zod’s evaluatory information, but not the content information he’s evaluating)</notes></p>
     </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Brad are looking at old family photos. In one, Zoe’s grandparents are talking on a beach, smiling, and Zoe examines their faces carefully.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe can pick up on her grandparents’ evaluatory information, but not content information they were evaluating)</notes></p>

<p>Justin can’t give an entire history lecture by just smiling and frowning for fifty minutes. The class would learn nothing about British Literature!</p>

<p>That's because a smile is evaluatory information, and has no can't convey content information. Justin can't smile to convey which 19th century book he was thinking about, or the date it was published.</p>


<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Degrees.</headline> We often notice when evaluatory information gets stripped—like by comparing speech with text messages:</p>
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p>
            <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Dad? When were you born?”</speech>

        <p>
            <speaker>Brad:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“1981.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe knows how Brad feels about the question, his answer, the situation, and so on)</notes>
        </p>
        
        <p class="or">- OR -</p>
        
        <p>
            <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*texting*</action> <speech>“Dad? When were you born?”</speech>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <narration>Her phone buzzes fifteen minutes later with the answer: 1981</narration>. <notes>(&larr;Zoe doesn’t know how Brad feels about the question, his answer, the situation, and so on)</notes>

    <p>The <term>content</term> information is the <term>same</term> in both examples. But the amount of <em>evaluatory</em> information is <em>less</em> in the text.</p>
