    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Content and evaluations are distinct</h1>
    
   
<p>We sometimes think <term>content</term> information and <em>evaluatory</em> information always travel together, but they don't.</p> 

<p>This is obvious once it's pointed out:</p>
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma is sniffling on the bus from sadness, her eyes red. The people around her are aware that she’s sad.</narration> <notes>(&larr;strangers can pick up on Emma’s evaluatory information, but not the content Emma is evaluating)</notes></p>
    
    </div>

<div class="vignette">
 <p><narration>Zoe is on a plane to Brazil. She looks up at the movie playing a few seats ahead of her. It's just a close-up of a man's face reacting to things off-screen. She has no idea of the context.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe can pick up on actor's evaluatory information, but not the content he's evaluating)</notes></p>
 </div>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Minh and his uncle talking about music and smiling and laughing. Minh’s baby nephew smiles.</narration> <notes>(&larr;baby can pick up on evaluatory information, but not content information)</notes></p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe watches people chatter animatedly on the sidewalk several stories below.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe can pick up on evaluatory information, but not the content information they’re evaluating)</notes></p>
    </div>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>General Zod continues to stand at alert. Trevor keeps an eye on General Zod staring out the window. He must really see something unusual out there.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor can pick up on General Zod’s evaluatory information, but not the content information he’s evaluating)</notes></p>
     </div>
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe and Brad are looking at old family photos. In one, Zoe’s grandparents are talking on a beach, smiling, and Zoe examines their faces carefully.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe can pick up on her grandparents’ evaluatory information, but not content information they were evaluating)</notes></p>

<p>Justin can’t give an entire history lecture by just standing silently in front of his class and smiling and frowning for fifty minutes. The class would learn nothing about British Literature!</p>

<p>That's because the <em>content</em> information would be missing—since smiling has no direct way of conveying content information. Justin can't smile to convey which 19th century book he was thinking about, or the date it was published.</p>

<p>That's because these are different kinds of information, about different things, communicated in different ways.</p> 

<div class="box">
    <p>Degrees. We can notice evaluatory information by noticing when and how it gets stripped—like by comparing speech with text messages:</p>
    
    <p>
        <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Dad? When were you born?”</speech>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <speaker>Brad:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“1981.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe knows how Brad feels about the question, his answer, the situation, and so on)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p>
        <speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*texting*</action> <speech>“Dad? When were you born?”</speech>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>Her phone buzzes fifteen minutes later with the answer: 1981</narration>. <notes>(&larr;Zoe doesn’t know how Brad feels about the question, his answer, the situation, and so on)</notes>
    </p>

    <p>The content information is the same in both examples. It's the evaluatory information that decreases—how Brad <em>feels</em> about things.</p>
