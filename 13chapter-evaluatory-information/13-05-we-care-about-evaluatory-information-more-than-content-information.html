 <p>Evaluatory information is the first thing we look for—because we care about <term>evaluatory</term> information <sem>more</sem> than we do <em>content</em> information:</p>

<p>
   For each photo, we probably looked <term>first</term> at the faces, and only <em>then</em> tried to infer what they were evaluating—if we tried to find this out at all. That's because we're most interested in evaluatory information.
    </p>
    
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">Our <sem>default priority</sem> is evaluatory information. We automatically soak up evaluatory information, and do so first, before paying attention to content information.</p>  
   
<p class="considertext">This prioritization is what makes us all automatically form emotion networks&mdash;it happens first, before anything else. Since it's always there, our emotion network makes up reactive context for everything we do in our lives.</p>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>We can compare the presence of evaluatory information by removing people (or other evaluators) from a picture:</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 38rem; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>If we remove the people, we remove not only most of the information from the picture—but also the kind of information that we usually find most interesting!</p>

<p>We find the evaluatory information in this picture interesting and acess it intuitively. But since we may not be able to explicitly parse what this information is telling us <callback>("what are they feeling in one word?")</callback>, the idea of "evaluatory information" can seem ambiguous—even abstract.</p>

<p>To see this evaluatory information as specific, we can try thinking about what we know they <em>aren't</em> feeling. They're not rage-filled or afraid. They're not immensely bored. While evaluatory information doesn't always convey something precise, we can see it is conveying something by what conclusions it removes.</p> 

<p>We can also see evaluatory information by thinking about its absence. The architecture in this picture conveys content information—like how stones carry information about their age, condition, location, origin, and so on.</p>

<p>But the stones aren't relating their expectations to their sense of consequences. <term>Stones</term> don't feel or express mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotions. Instead, <em>we</em> express evaluatory information by looking at them or being around them.</p>
 
<p>When we look at the architecture, we may express a lot of evaluatory information—maybe because we know architecture history, or think the design looks cool, or have maintained masonry before. In this case, the picture will be interesting to us because of <term>our own</term> evaluatory information. If we don't have this background, this picture will be less interesting to us, again because of our <em>lack</em> of evaluatory information.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Majority.</headline> The majority of the information we share with each other is usually evaluatory information. The content information is like a nucleus that evaluatory information gathers around:</p>

    <p>When Emma suggested blowing off an assignment and getting ice cream instead, the actual content information is pretty small <callback>(“ice cream?”)</callback>. But there's a lot of evaluatory information around it—in this case, several people each share their own evaluations on the content with each other.</p>
