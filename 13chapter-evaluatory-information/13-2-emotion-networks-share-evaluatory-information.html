<p>So is humor <term>content</term> information or <term>evaluatory</term> information? We already know the answer to this—humor is <em>evaluatory</em> information:
    </p>

<p>Our emotional state is an expression of our evaluations. These evaluations aren't private—we share them with each other:</p>

<p>These emotional states—our evaluatory states—make up our emotion network:</p>

<p>We can pick up on these evaluations—anger, boredom, humor, sadness, and so on—on our emotion network, even without knowing what these evaluations are of.</p>

<p>All this is groundwork to help us think about what, exactly, humor is—and what it does in our lives.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Solitariness.</headline> Sometimes we don't know what to make of the fact that we're so blank-faced in private. We may smile broadly as we say goodbye to a friend, only for our face to immediately become blank when we close the door. What's going on here?</p>
     
    <p>When we think of emotion tells <callback>(like smiling broadly)</callback> as how we communicate on our emotion network <callback>(we smile broadly at our friend so they can see our evaluatory information)</callback>—it makes sense that our emotion tells would be different and less intense in private. We communicate less when there's no one to communicate with!</p>
     
  <p>More specifically, our requirements for communication change. If we see a friend across the room, we speak loudly—when we're close we speak softer. When we're using our laptop to play music at a party, we turn the volume up—when everyone leaves and we sit in front of our computer, we turn the volume down.</p>
    
    <p>When we feel very private, like when we live alone and lock the door to our apartment, we're still radiating information about our evaluations—but the person we're communicating with is ourselves. </p>
     
   <p>We still have to communicate our evaluations to ourselves, because we only know them by our expression of them, through emotion tells—but when we feel confident that no one else is around, we can express these in softer ways:</p>
   
       <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-2-emotion-networks-share-evaluatory-information/13-2-3-box-loud-soft.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >
    
    
   <p> This is why our emotion tells get "louder" when we simulate a social environment. When we're in a very private place and stream a live show, talk to ourselves (or a pet), and so on, we're simulating a social environment—and so we'll express more varied and intense humor tells than otherwise. </p>
