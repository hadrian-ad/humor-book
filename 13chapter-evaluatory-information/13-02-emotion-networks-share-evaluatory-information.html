<p>So is humor <term>content</term> information or <em>evaluatory</em> information?</p>

    alt="This image shows an evaluation graph with question marks for both the label and the evaluations. Annotations ask if humor is content information (label) or evaluatory information (graph)";

   <p>We already know the answer to this—humor is <sem>evaluatory</sem> information:

   <p>It's this evaluatory information that makes up our emotion network:</p> 
   
    <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-2-emotion-networks-share-evaluatory-information/13-2-2-laughing-man.png

    alt="There's a picture of a man laughing intensely, shining humor, hands open. Annotations say 'the man radiates emotion tells (evaluatory information)' pointing to a circle radiating arrows, with the arrows pointing toward a list of humor tells like laughing, smiling, flushing, loosening, touching self, loss of situational awareness, optimism, and so on, which is then pointed at the mistakes and OKs blaancing on an evaluation graph. This graph has a question mark, Which is annotated with 'we don't know the content information, even if we know the evaluatory information. ";

<p>Our emotional state is an expression of our evaluations. These evaluations aren't private—we share them with each other:</p>

    title="Emotional state";
    style="max-width: 18rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>These emotional states—our evaluatory states—make up our emotion network:</p>

    <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-2-emotion-networks-share-evaluatory-information/13-2-4-emotion-network-as-emotional-states.png

    alt="Two emotional state boxes radiating arrows are in an emotion network dashed line. Annotation says 'emotion network is an awareness of emotional states.";
    title="Emotional state II";
    style="max-width: 18rem; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>We can pick up on these evaluations on our emotion network—<emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>boredom</emotions>, <emotions>humor</emotions>, <emotions>sadness</emotions>, and so on—even without knowing what these evaluations are of.</p>

<p>All this is groundwork to help us think about what, exactly, humor is—and what it does in our lives.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Solitariness.</headline> Sometimes we don't know what to make of the fact that we're so blank-faced in private—like how we smile broadly as we say goodbye to a friend, only for our face to immediately become blank when we close the door. What's going on here?</p>
     
    <p>When we think of emotion tells as how we communicate on our emotion network <callback>(we smile broadly at our friend so they can see our evaluatory information)</callback>—it makes sense that the intensity of our emotion tells changes depending on if we're around others. We communicate less when there's no one to communicate with!</p>
     
  <p>More specifically, our requirements for communication change&mdash;like it does for everything. If we see a friend across the room, we speak loudly—when we're close we speak softer. When we're using our laptop to play music at a party, we turn the volume up—when everyone leaves and we sit in front of our computer, we turn the volume down.</p>
    
    <p>When we feel very private— like alone in our locked apartment—we're still radiating information about our evaluations. But the person we're communicating to is ourselves.</p>
     
   <p>We still have to communicate our evaluations to ourselves, because we only know our evaluations by our expression of them through emotion tells. But we can express these in softer ways that don't require the same kind of telegraphing as they do around others:</p>
   
       <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-2-emotion-networks-share-evaluatory-information/13-2-5-box-loud-soft.png

    alt="This image has two circles with arrows radiating out. The one of the left has big arrows, the one on the right has small arrows. Annotations say 'when we feel public, our emotion tells are 'loud,' and when we feel private, our emotion tells are 'soft.'";
    title="Strength of signal";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

    
   <p> This is why our emotion tells get "louder" when we're alone but also simulating a social environment. When we stream a live show, talk to ourselves (or a pet), and so on, we'll often express more varied and intense humor tells than otherwise.</p>
