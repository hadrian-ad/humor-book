<p>Sometimes we think formal writing probably has <term>more</term> information in it than informal writing—but it often has <em>less</em>:</p>

<p>Even though the <term>content</term> information was the same in both <callback>(Emma got into the conference)</callback>, the amount of <em>evaluatory</em> information was different. <callback>(How Emma felt about getting into the conference)</callback>.</p> 

<p>The informal writing fit <em>more</em> information in the same amount of space than the formal writing.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class=considertext>Formal writing tends to minimize evaluatory information. This doesn’t mean <term>readers</term> don’t create their own evaluatory information in response to formal writing—it just means the <em>documents</em> themselves don't convey much evaluatory information.</p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>We use evaluatory information to interpret sentences. This is why grammatically straightforward sentences can still be ambiguous when texted. <callback>("Did you get groceries?")</callback> Evaluatory cues can be used to increase the information in a sentence and decrease ambiguity. <callback>("lmaoo")</callback></p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Density.</headline> Formal writing struggles to convey evaluatory information. This is one reason descriptions of humor are so stilted in formal documents—they avoid oral words like “funny”; transliterations of laughter <callback>(“hurhh!”)</callback>; exclamation marks; and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Instead, we get relatively lifeless phrases like <callback>“laughter was heard,” “the comment was met with derision,” the speaker entertained the audience for an hour,”</callback> and so on. This formal language doesn’t record much evaluatory information about duration, intensity, frequency, or whether the humor tilted toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance.</p>
    
    <p>By contrast, informal writing <term>wants</term> to increase evaluatory information—since we use informal writing to group and efficiently share information over our emotion network. This is why informal writing constantly incorporates abbreviations, acronyms, colors, emoticons, emojis, filters, font, formatting, meme formats, repeat letters, timing standards, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This is often most noticeable when it comes to humor. Informal writing uses words like <callback>lol, lolz, lololololol, lmaoo, rofl, roflmao,</callback> and so on—which add precision and nuance to the evaluatory information in a way that we can’t do as quickly or efficiently in formal writing.</p>

<p>We can look at an example of how informal English increases the amount of evaluatory information.</p>

<p>Below is a section of a 2020 chat reacting during a livestream. Everyone was joining a meeting remotely, from across a country:</p>
<div class="vignette"> 
     <p><narration>Lina joins the livestream for a climate activism group. The speaker is great, and the mood is jubiliant—people chime in in the chat.</narration></p>

     <p class="vig-indent">Oh gosh so fair.</p>
     
     </div>
<p>Since they were watching a livestream, their goal in the chat was to share as much evaluatory information as quickly as possible—content information was neither here nor there, just like when a crowd boos, cheers, claps, stomps their feet, and so on.</p>

<p>By using informal English, they made the most of limited space, time, and attention—the informal English increased the density of their evaluatory information. That's because the difference between <callback>“I'm doing this”</callback> and <callback>“IM SO DOING THIS”</callback> is greater information density:</p>

<img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-7-formal-documents-evaluatory-information/13-7-2-case-study.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>The informal English has more evaluatory information. Often, formal English tries to make up for its low density of evaluatory information by becoming much longer. So instead of the dense and short <callback>"IM SO DOING THIS,"</callback> they go for something light and long. <callback>("I have to say, everyone, that I feel engaged and ready. I think I'll be taking action this time around, and I'll do so with vigor. I feel like yelling, to be honest.")</callback></p>

<p>Above, what's the benefit of the formal English over the informal English ? Not much. It's not sharing much more content information, and is only taking more time to share the same amount of evaluatory information. In a livestream, this time isn't available—by the time someone types out a few sentences, what they're reacting to may be passed. </p>
