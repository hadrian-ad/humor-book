<p>Sometimes we think formal writing probably has more information in it than informal writing—but it often has less:</p>

    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*texting*</action> <speech>"Did you get groceries?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;formal writing)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Trevor looks at the text and wonders: Is she blaming him, laughing at him, happy that he got her groceries, upset, or...?</narration><notes>(&larr;the formal writing was less clear to Trevor than the informal writing)</notes></p>

    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(excited)</internalaction> <action>*texting*</action> <speech>“My paper was accepted into the conference.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;formal writing)</notes></p>

<p>Above, the informal writing fits more information in the same amount of space than the formal writing.</p>

<p>Even though the content information was the same in both (Emma got into the conference), the amount of evaluatory information was different. (How Emma felt about getting into the conference).</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p>Formal writing tends to minimize evaluatory information. This doesn’t mean readers don’t create their own evaluatory information in response to formal writing—it just means the documents themselves don't convey much evaluatory information.</p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>We use evaluatory information to interpret sentences. This is why grammatically straightforward sentences can still be ambiguous when texted. ("Did you get groceries?") Evaluatory cues can be used to increase the information in a sentence and decrease ambiguity. ("lmaoo")</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p>Density. Formal writing struggles to convey evaluatory information. This is one reason descriptions of humor are so stilted in formal documents—they avoid oral words like “funny”; transliterations of laughter (“hurhh!”); exclamation marks; and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Instead, we get relatively lifeless phrases like “laughter was heard,” “the comment was met with derision,” the speaker entertained the audience for an hour,” and so on. This formal language doesn’t record much evaluatory information about duration, intensity, or whether things tilted toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance.</p>
    
    <p>By contrast, informal writing wants to increase evaluatory information—since we use informal writing to group and efficiently share information over our emotion network. This is why informal writing constantly incorporates abbreviations, acronyms, colors, emoticons, emojis, filters, font, formatting, meme formats, repeat letters, timing standards, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This is often most noticeable when it comes to humor. Informal writing uses words like lol, lolz, lololololol, lmaoo, rofl, roflmao, and so on—which add precision and nuance to the evaluatory information in a way that we can’t do as quickly or efficiently in formal writing.</p>
