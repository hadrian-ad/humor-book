<p>Sometimes we think formal writing probably has more information in it than informal writing—but it often has less:</p>

<p>Above, the informal writing fits <em>more</em> information in the same amount of space than the formal writing.</p>

<p>Even though the <term>content</term> information was the same in both <callback>(Emma got into the conference)</callback>, the amount of <em>evaluatory</em> information was different. <callback>(How Emma felt about getting into the conference)</callback>.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p>Formal writing tends to minimize evaluatory information. This doesn’t mean <term>readers</term> don’t create their own evaluatory information in response to formal writing—it just means the <em>documents</em> themselves don't convey much evaluatory information.</p> 
    
    </div>
    
<p>We use evaluatory information to interpret sentences. This is why grammatically straightforward sentences can still be ambiguous when texted. <callback>("Did you get groceries?")</callback> Evaluatory cues can be used to increase the information in a sentence and decrease ambiguity. <callback>("lmaoo")</callback></p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Density.</headline> Formal writing struggles to convey evaluatory information. This is one reason descriptions of humor are so stilted in formal documents—they avoid oral words like “funny”; transliterations of laughter <callback>(“hurhh!”)</callback>; exclamation marks; and so on.</p>
    
    <p>Instead, we get relatively lifeless phrases like <callback>“laughter was heard,” “the comment was met with derision,” the speaker entertained the audience for an hour,”</callback> and so on. This formal language doesn’t record much evaluatory information about duration, intensity, or whether things tilted toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance.</p>
    
    <p>By contrast, informal writing <term>wants</term> to increase evaluatory information—since we use informal writing to group and efficiently share information over our emotion network. This is why informal writing constantly incorporates abbreviations, acronyms, colors, emoticons, emojis, filters, font, formatting, meme formats, repeat letters, timing standards, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>This is often most noticeable when it comes to humor. Informal writing uses words like <callback>lol, lolz, lololololol, lmaoo, rofl, roflmao,</callback> and so on—which add precision and nuance to the evaluatory information in a way that we can’t do as quickly or efficiently in formal writing.</p>
