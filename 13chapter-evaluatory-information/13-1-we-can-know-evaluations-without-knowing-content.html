Content information and evaluatory information are separate things. We can have one without the other.

So even though we don't know what the dog below sees (content information)—but we do know how it feels about what it sees (evaluatory information):


In other words, we're picking up on the dog's evaluations—it's mistakes and OKs. We can do this even without knowing what it's evaluating.

Similarly, we don't know what people are reacting to below (content information), but we do know how they are reacting (evaluatory information):



In the same way we can know evaluatory information without content information, the opposite is true too. Below, we know what someone is looking at—but since we can't see the viewer, we don't know how they feel about it:


Content information and evaluatory information often go together—but even so, they don't always. That's because they're different things.
