    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Words and emotions fill different communicative roles</h1>
    

<p>At this point, we can think about what words do, and what emotions do. They work together, but fill different roles:</p>

 

<p class="indepth"><strong>Emotions.</strong> We use emotion tells to share evaluatory information—and emotion tells share this with much greater information density than words do alone. This is obvious whenever we look at a transcription of a typical conversation:
    
     </p>

<div class="vignette">
  <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Emma… Emma… is the… uh. Is the…”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“The… the thing…”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“No, the other…, uh…”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Um. Mm. I think it’s…”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Later…”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah. February, or something. I, uh, can check.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“No, it’s—it’s good.”</speech></p> 
    </div>

 

<p class="indepth">When we transcribe day-to-day conversation into just words, we strip the conversation of most of the emotion tells—which also strips the conversation of most of its information!
    </p>

<p class="indepth">To see how much information has been stripped, we can notice that we don’t even know whether Zoe was angry, amused, confused, crushed, bored, eager, excited, happy, hopeful, indifferent, nervous, sad, thoughtful, wistful, and so on—or in what combination, at which moments.</p>

 

<p class="indepth"><strong>Words.</strong> We use words (or indications, pictures, or so on) to activate specific topics in combination or sequences—even if those topics are distant, fictional, future, past, surreal, and so on. This ensures we're synchronized on active topics with someone. </p>

 

<p class="indepth">Once we're synchronized on active topics, we know what our emotion tells are communicating about:
    </p>


                   <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-8-words-emotions/13-8-1-nucleus-dinosaurs.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 30rem; margin-left: " 
     >



<p class="indepth">If there were dinosaurs around, Emma and Zoe could simply point to them to synchronize their active topics. But words allow them to synchronize around these topics even when dinosaurs aren't around! </p>

 

<p class="indepth">Words let them stay on the same page when exchanging evaluatory information. So if Emma mentions a dinosaur and Zoe grins, Emma can sort Zoe's evaluatory information into the 'dinosaur' bin. But if Zoe just grins out of the blue, Emma won't know which bin to sort this evaluatory information into—at least, not without words.</p>



<p class="indepth">The topic 'dinosaur' isn't that complicated to convey without words—since we can act them out, draw them, point at a picture, and so on. But this gets harder as soon as we start chaining topics together, like 'keeping dinosaurs as pets.'</p>



<p class="indepth"><term>Without</term> words, it's hard for Emma to get Zoe to synchronize over the topic 'keeping dinosaurs as pets.' But it's pretty easy <em>with</em> words—Emma just says: <callback>"How awesome would it be to have a dinosaur as a pet?"</callback> and then takes in Zoe's reaction.</p>

<p class="indepth"><strong>Words and emotions together.</strong> In this sense, emotions are like a fire hydrant of information. Emotions have a lot of informational volume, but making use of that volume depends on on words to direct that information somewhere specific.</p>

 

<p class="indepth">We can see Emma do this below: she uses words to activate specific combinations of topics, which lets her and Zoe share evaluatory information on those topics specifically:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Emma and Zoe are watching cars from a bench.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Remember Mr. Myrtle?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma uses speech to activate an old topic)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(angry)</internalaction> <speech>“Yes.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe uses their emotional network to share evaluatory information on that topic)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Remember Mrs. Goldberg?</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma uses speech to activate another topic)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(happy)</internalaction> <speech>“Yeah!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe uses their emotional network to share evaluatory information on that topic)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“They got married!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma uses speech to combine and introduce topics)</notes></p>
    
<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(confused)</internalaction> <speech>“No!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe uses their emotional network to share evaluatory information on that topic)</notes></p>
    
    </div>

                   <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-8-words-emotions/13-8-3-topics-words.png

<p class="indepth">Emma used words to synchronize their active topics, which lets them share evaluatory information on the same thing. But even though the words were necessary for this kind of control over topics, the majority of the information that was communicated was actually done over the emotion network.
    </p>
 

<p class="indepth">This is obvious when we count the words: Emma spoke nine words, and Zoe spoke three. That's not a lot of words! Emma's words were necessary to topicalize the evaluatory information—but at the same time, the words themselves were an insignificant amount of the total information communicated with each other.</p>

<p>This helps us see how words and emotion tells work together to be exponentially more useful together than when apart. It also helps us avoid giving too much weight to the role that words play by themselves in our day-to-day lives. </p>

<p>This is important when it comes to thinking about humor. Humor is an <em>emotion</em>, and not something about <term>words</term> per se. It’s based on <em>evaluations</em> of content, not the content itself. In interactions, it’s this sharing and synchronizing of evaluations that makes interpersonal humor possible. </p>

<p>This gives us context for the rest of this book. Getting better at humor isn’t really about getting better at words—it means getting better at emotions.</p>



<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Sophistication.</headline> Even though humor is an emotion, we sometimes think of humor as a skill of <term>rhetorical</term> sophistication. But it’s not—humor is better thought of as a skill of <em>emotional</em> sophistication.</p> 
   
    <p>This is obvious whenever we look at what makes people laugh outside of spectator entertainment. Most of the time, it’s not beautiful or clever speech. Often, the speech has no special qualities at all—in fact, the coherence of our speech usually <term>declines</term> when we’re feeling intense humor with a friend. But since humor isn’t rhetorical sophistication, the coherence of our speech is often neither here nor there to how much humor we feel.</p>   
    
    <p>Our verbal communication activates certain topics, which partially constructs someone’s evaluatory state. From there, we shift mistakes and OKs into humor—an activity that’s much broader and subtler than “good speech.” It’s instead something much more intricately linked to evaluations and synchronization, and requires emotional sophistication to do well.</p></div>

There are two kinds of information. There's content information, and <vocab>evaluatory information</vocab>. Evaluatory information is shared over our emotion network. Humor is a kind of evaluatory information.</p>

<ul>
   <li>We can know someone's evaluations without knowing what they're evaluating.</li> 
    
   <li>We give a higher survey priority to evaluatory information than to content information. We experience this as interest.</li> 
    
    <li>Evaluatory information often makes up the bulk of the information. When this information is stripped, we can struggle to interpret things.</li>
