    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We care about evaluatory information more than we do content information</h1>
    
   
 <p>Evaluatory information is the first thing we look for—because we care about evaluatory information more than content information:</p>

 

<p>
   For each photo, we probably looked <term>first</term> at the faces, and only <em>then</em> tried to infer what they were evaluating—if we tried to find this out at all. That's because we're most interested in evaluatory information.

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">Our default priority is evaluatory information. We automatically soak up evaluatory information, whether looking at pictures, looking out a window, or walking down the street. Since we all prioritize this, we all automatically form emotion networks—something that normally precedes any sharing of content information.</p>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>All things being equal, most pictures are more interesting <term>with</term> people in them than they are without them. That's because the majority of the information in these pictures is evaluatory information:</p>



<p>If we removed the people, we'd remove not only most of the information from the picture—but also the kind of information that we usually find most interesting.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <headline>Majority.</headline> The majority of the information we share with each other is usually evaluatory information. The content information is like a nucleus that evaluatory information gathers around:
     
    
     
    When Emma suggested blowing off an assignment and getting ice cream instead, the actual content information is pretty small (“ice cream?”). But there's a lot of evaluatory information around it—like several people each with a different emotional state.
