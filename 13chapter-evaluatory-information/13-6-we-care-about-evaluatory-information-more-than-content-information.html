    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We care about evaluatory information more than we do content information</h1>
    
   
 <p>Evaluatory information is the first thing we look for—because we care about evaluatory information more than content information:</p>

<p>
   For each photo, we probably looked <term>first</term> at the faces, and only <em>then</em> tried to infer what they were evaluating—if we tried to find this out at all. That's because we're most interested in evaluatory information.
    </p>
    
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">Our default priority is evaluatory information. We automatically soak up evaluatory information, whether looking at pictures, looking out a window, or walking down the street. Since we all prioritize this, we all automatically form emotion networks—something that normally precedes any sharing of content information.</p>
    
    </div>
    
    <p>All things being equal, most pictures are more interesting <term>with</term> people in them than they are without them. That's because the majority of the information in these pictures is evaluatory information:</p>

           <img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-6-we-care-about-evaluatory-information-more-than-content-information/13-6-2-cropping-info.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>If we removed the people, we'd remove not only most of the information from the picture—but also the kind of information that we usually find most interesting.</p>


<button type="button" class="collapsible-example"> Method</button>

   <div class="content-example">

<img src=../images/13c-images-evaluatory-information/13-5-evaluatory-information-is-interesting/13-5-1-example-river.jpg

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>We find the evaluatory information in this picture interesting and intuitively access it. But since we may not be able to explicitly parse what this information is telling us ("what are they feeling in one word?"), this "evaluatory information" can seem ambiguous—even abstract.</p>

<p>To see this evaluatory information as specific, we can try thinking about what we know they <em>aren't</em> feeling. They're not rage-filled or afraid. They're not immensely bored. Their evaluatory information subtracts from possible outcomes.</p> 

<p>We can also see evaluatory information by thinking about its absence. The architecture in this picture covenys content information—like their age, condition, location, origin, and so on.</p>

<p>But the stones aren't relating their expectations to their sense of consequences. They don't feel or express mistake-predominant or OK-predominant emotions. Instead, <term>we</term> express evaluatory information by looking at them or being around them.</p>
 
<p>If no one is in this picture, <term>we</term> may express a lot of evaluatory information—maybe because we know architecture history, or think the design looks cool, or have maintained masonry before. In this case, the picture will be interesting to us because of our evaluatory information. If we <term>don't</term> have this background, this picture will be less interesting to us, again because of our (lack) of evaluatory information.</p>
  
    </div>

 
<div class="box">
    <headline>Majority.</headline> The majority of the information we share with each other is usually evaluatory information. The content information is like a nucleus that evaluatory information gathers around:

    When Emma suggested blowing off an assignment and getting ice cream instead, the actual content information is pretty small (“ice cream?”). But there's a lot of evaluatory information around it—like several people each with a different emotional state.
