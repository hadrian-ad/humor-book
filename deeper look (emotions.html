       
<p>Since we grew up with words like "humor" and "emotions," we often find it hard to imagine a world without them&mdash;a bit like how it would be hard to imagine a world without words like "tree" or "cloud."</p>

<p>But surprisingly, <sem>both</sem> <term>humor</term> and <em>emotions</em> are relatively new words, whose modern meanings didn't actually exist for most of history.</p>

<p>Let's go over a quick history of both of these words:</p>


<h2>Humor</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <p>"Humor" originally meant "juice of a plant or animal." So we can squeeze the humors from apples <callback>(apple juice)</callback>, and squirrels are full of squirrel humors. Words like <sem-weak>humor, humid, humidify, humidor, humus,</sem-weak> and so on all share the same root of <sem-weak>"moist, wet."</sem-weak></p>
    
    <p>Humor didn't have any association with laughter at all&mdash;and didn't have any association with emotions in general&mdash;until just a few hundred years ago. That's when dimensions in a popular personality modeling system were labeled with human humors <callback>(human "juices")</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p>Eventually, the combininations of fluids <callback>(humors specifically)</callback> was seen as an extraneous step, and "humor" started to directly mean something like "malleable medium of disposition" <callback>(humor generally)</callback>, often with a capricious subtext. <callback>(“The baby was in bad humor yesterday, but is in good humor today!”)</callback></p>
    
    <p>Over the next two hundred years or so, the meaning of humor shifted from "the malleable medium of disposition" into all the things it also means today&mdash;which is a very broad tent where are these meanings coexist and jumble together.</p>
    
    <p>The modern meanings of "humor" tend to relate from different angles to laughter&mdash;including humor's overlapping meanings like <callback>"laughter,"</callback> <callback>"cause of laughter,"</callback> <callback>"weirdness associated with what sometimes causes laughter,"</callback> <callback>"laughter associated with weirdness,"</callback> <callback>"jokes in general,"</callback> <callback>"interpersonal ability to generate laughter,"</callback> <callback>"a feeling associated with laughter,"</callback> and so on.</p> 
    
    
        </div>


<h2>Emotion</h2> 
<div class="h2">
    <p>The word “emotion” was originally just a variation of the word “motion.” Like <term>(e)rupture</term> and <term>rupture</term>, <em>(e)motion</em> was just <em>motion</em> with an emphatic or expelling <sem-weak>e-</sem-weak> in front. 
    
    <p>This is why early uses of emotion were about <sem>motion</sem>:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>an earthquake was emotion in the ground <callback>(the ground shakes, has motion)</callback></li>
        <li>a crowd had emotion as they filed out of the stadium <callback>(they moved together, com-motion)</callback></li>
        <li>a letter could cause a reader’s emotion <callback>(like pacing, from internal feelings)</callback></li></ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>From there, the word eventually developed into its current sense of<callback>“cogitated feelings, especially strong ones (that cause movement).”</callback></p> 
    
    <p>Sometimes, we use the word “emotion” expansively beyond movement, like to refer to all inner life. But the meaning of “emotion” constantly drifts back to motion.</p>
           
  <p>If a director says <callback>“let’s do the scene again, this time with more EMOTION!”</callback>—they don’t mean more vivid internal sensations. The director mean more <sem-weak>emoting</sem-weak>, more expressive action in the body and face. </p>
       
<p>Similarly, we call cats emotionless&mdash;not because cats don't have feelings, moods, opinions, personality, preferences, reactions, and so on, because they obviously do&mdash;but because their faces don’t move. Cats can’t emote in the same way dogs can with their moving <callback>(emotional)</callback> faces. </p>
    
<div class="consider">
       
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
        <p class="considertext">It's the same for people. When a novelist describes someone as "emotionless" they often mean they have a stony poker face <callback>("motionless")</callback>&mdash; not that there's nothing happening inside them.</p>
        
        <!--
        <p class="considertext">Similarly, we think of stormy seas and blowing trees as emotional, where it's the motion that gives power to the analogy to human emotion.  </p>
-->
    </div>
  
     <!--   
     <p>This association with movement is one reason emotion sometimes struggles to encompass everything we want it to&mdash;including things like intentions due to mood or tone of reflections. </p>
     -->
    </div> 

<p>"Humor" and "emotion" took on new meanings together because of a popular metaphor that caught several words in its wake, giving them new meanings&mdash;the metaphor that <term>reactions and interpretations</term> were <em>liquid</em>.</p>

<p>Since <term>humors</term> <callback>(liquids)</callback> were particularly <em>emotional</em> <callback>(fluid)</callback>, they both suited these metaphorical descriptions of human experiences. Our evaluatory nature infused us like sap or blood&mdash;mixed and behaved like liquids in a container&mdash;and could be expelled or drained in some way.</p>
<p>


<p>This popular metaphor is why these two words, humor and emotion, changed together from literally describing <term>fluids</term> and <term>movement</term> to metaphorically describing <em>cause of laughter</em> and <em>feelings</em>.</p>  

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We have plenty of remenants of this metaphor cluster, like when we talk about emotions as something we are <sem-weak>"filled with"</sem-weak> that can be <sem-weak>"let out"</sem-weak> or <sem-weak>"expelled."</sem-weak></p>
    
    
    <p class="considertext">These metaphors replaced the Latin word for emotion <callback>(affect)</callback>, which meant <sem-weak>"to have done to,"</sem-weak> <sem-weak>"to have been connected in such a way."</sem-weak></p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">The replacement of <term>affect</term> <callback>(done to us; out-to-in)</callback> with <em>emotions/humor</em> <callback>(happens within us; in-to-out)</callback> also upturned and outdated many traditional affect-affilated words, like <sem-weak>merry</sem-weak> <callback>(something that causes enjoyement out-to-in, "merry weather")</callback>.</p>
    </div>



<p>One of the points of all this is to give some distance from the modern sense of these words. These words dominate how we think about ourselves, even when they're often confusing! </p> 

<p>But when we know we can step back and see their metaphors&mdash;and a bit strange, nebulous, and inconsistent&mdash;we have more freedom to treat these words as one tool in a bigger toolbox in think about ourselves.
</p>


<div class="box">
       <p><headline>Slang.</headline> The modern meaning of "humor" is kind of slangy. This helps us understand what kind of word we're dealing with.</p> 
       
       <p>We can feel the slanginess of "humor" by imagining that we're saying "juice” instead of humor:</p> 
        
        <ul class="close-list">
         <li>“he just has a great sense of juice about him”</li>
         <li>“that movie has great juice”</li> 
         <li>"it's juice that makes life worth living!"</li>
        <li>“just juice him, it's not worth the conflict”</li> 
        </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
        
        
    <p>One way of thinking about "slang" is that the meaning doesn't match its etymology. This gives some context to a new word like humor <callback>("moistness")</callback>, which often feels categorically different to more durable emotional words:</p>    
    
<ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            <sem-weak>anger, anxiety, angina,</sem-weak> and so on come from the root for <sem-weak>"painful, painfully constricted"</sem-weak>
        </li>
            
    <li>    <sem-weak>grief, grave, aggravate,</sem-weak> and so on the root of <sem-weak>"heavy"</sem-weak>
               </li>         
        
        <li>
            <sem-weak>love</sem-weak> from the root for <sem-weak>"care, love" </sem-weak>
        </li>
    </ul>
         
         <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
         
         <p>These words have been stable for thousands of years! By comparison, "juice" exists in a different neighborhood.</p>
         
                 <p>That doesn't mean humor is less important or meaningful than the other words. It just means it has characteristics that we have to talke into account when thinking about it.</p>

<p>A note from the author&mdash;while I did almost no conventional research on humor at all for this book, of indispensable help was the <callback>(the stupendously weird and monumental)</callback> <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>. As a high schooler, this book introduced me to the ideas of mistakes and OKs, which let me spend about fifteen years observing humor through that lens&mdash;and directly led to this book being the way it was.</p>
 
<p><book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> (2004-ish) was written by Warren Shibles&mdash;the clanless and deeply unloved arch-academic. His lunar clarity of thinking and writing profoundly influenced me&mdash;not just his book about humor, but also his books on death, emotions, ethics, humor, lies, love, time, and so on. His refusal to mystify his writing directly influenced the style of this book.</p> 

<p>Never popular or famous&mdash;hated by his colleagues—autistic during a time that gave them little quarter&mdash;his main surviving writings are (unfortunately) articles against second-wave feminism. <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> itself was a pioneering work of Internet self-publishing and continual development&mdash;but now only exists on Internet archival sites.</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p><speaker>Obituary:</speaker> Following Warren's wishes no formal services were held. <i>"What begins as a study of death ends up, to some extent, as a study of life and love."</i></p>
</div>


<p>This book is indebted to Warren Shibles, who wrote <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> (2004)&mdash;which is easily one of the strangest books ever written. Lost to time, it exists only on Internet archival services.</p>

<p>Shibles was an enthusiastic pioneer of online publishing, and wrote books with lucid strangeness on death, love, time, lies, humanism, emotions, ethics, linquistics, philosophy, and humor. He had a kind of lunar clarity to his thinking that made mixed impressions on different readers.</p>
  
<p>He was an autistic professor at a time when the world wasn't particularly kind to them&mdash;and Shibles bickered constantly with his department. He was looked down on by his colleages for never completing his PhD course. He loved writing children's philosophy books that no child could ever love&mdash;like <book-title>Time: A Critical Analysis for Children</book-title>.</p>

<p>Without influence in his lifetime, he's almost completely forgotten&mdash;with one of the few exceptions being the author of this book. I read <book-title>The Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title> as a high schooler, and it  made me a sleeper agent for humor ethnography&mdash;and sent me through university being puzzled that thoughts about humor were often so disorganized.</p>

<p>Shibles' allowed me to spend more than a decade thinking independently about humor, developing an expanded and readable presentation of Shibles' thoughts on humor, with a certain degree of normalcy added in.</p>

<p>It also helps characterize this book's study of <vocab>humor dynamics</vocab>&mdash;a description of laughing and smiling over time that involves thinking fluidly about evaluations over time. This incidentally helps describe other experiences as well&mdash;and, in some ways, helpfully re-uses the word "humor."</p>
