<p>Sometimes, humor is unfitted when it’s <term>overused</term>. <callback>(We laugh so hard we miss a customer)</callback>. But other times, humor is unfitted because it’s <em>underused</em>:</p>

    <p>In the same way people react negatively to an unfitted <term>excess</term> of humor tells <callback>(“ladies!”)</callback>, people also react negatively to an unfitted <em>absence</em> of humor tells:</p>

<p>In the above examples, it wasn't the <term>presence</term> of humor tells that was unfitted, but their <em>absence</em>.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> The intensity of humor also has a fittedness. Since humor tells express intensity, the fittedness of intensity is already baked into the fittedness of humor tells. For instance, a <humor-tell>loud laugh</humor-tell> is fitted in different places than a <humor-tell>quiet laugh</humor-tell> is.</p>
    
    <p>In these cases, it's not the <term>laugh</term> itself that's unfitted, but the <em>intensity</em> of the laugh that's unfitted.</p>
    
    <p>Other times, it's not too much intensity that's unfitted&mdash;it's too little intensity that's unfitted. This is like Jessica's manager, who saw high-intensity humor as unfitted <callback>("ladies!")</callback>, along with low-intensity humor <callback>("smile more")</callback>. That's because intensity is seen as fitted within a low and high range.</p>
