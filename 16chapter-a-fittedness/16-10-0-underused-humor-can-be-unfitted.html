<p>Sometimes, we think humor is unfitted when it’s <term>too intense</term>. <callback>(We laugh so hard we miss a customer)</callback>. But other times, we think humor is unfitted because it’s <em>not intense enough</em>:</p>

    <p>In the same way people react negatively to an unfitted <term>excess</term> of humor tells, people also react negatively to an unfitted <em>absence</em> of humor tells:</p>

<p>In the above examples, it wasn't the <term>presence</term> of humor that was unfitted, but its <em>absence</em>. The intensity of humor is seen as fitted within a low and high range.</p>
