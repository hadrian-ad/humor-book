    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor tells determine fittedness</h1>
    

<p>We can also think about fittedness with <a href="../8chapter-humor-tell/8-0-humor-tells.html">humor tells</a>.</p> 

<div class="listbox">
   <p class="listbox-headline">Humor tells</p>
<p><i>brightening, energy, expansive posture, eyes twinkling, flushing, higher speaking register, informal posture, informal movement, laughter, loosening, reduction of physical tension, relaxed posture, smiling, touching others, touching self, efforts to spread humor, fast thinking, fast speaking, focusing on present, high energy, increased agency, loss of situational awareness, non-normative behavior, optimism, raised spirits, reduction of stress, social integration, social seeking, social tightening.</i></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>This lets us break apart questions of fittedness into behavior.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">Instead of asking “where does humor fit?”, we can ask: <callback>“where does <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell> fit? Where does <humor-tell>brightening</humor-tell> <sem>not</sem> fit?”</callback>&mdash;and the same of <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social integration</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We intuitively know it wouldn’t be fitted for Sam to play wrestle with the director of Drama Dream when she comes on stage—since that would be a moment where <humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>informal movement</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell> would be unfitted.</p>

<p>When there’s disagreement over where humor is “appropriate,” the disagreement isn’t always about the <term>general</term> idea of humor—it’s often about <em>specific</em> humor tells:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p>
    <narration>Owen and Emma are playing a co-op game where teamwork is essential. Owen keeps laughing and dropping putting a hand on his head, even during gameplay.</narration>
</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*alarmed*</action> <speech>"Dude, stay focused!"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma thinks <humor-tell>touching self</humor-tell> is unfitted in this situation)</notes></p>

</div>

  <div class="vignette">
        <p>
        <narration>Zoe, Owen, and Emma are working on a group project, but they can’t stop laughing and getting distracted. Owen wants to make progress.</narration>
            </p>
            <p>
            <speaker>Owen:</speaker> <speech>“Okay for <term>real</term>, we have to get <em>serious.</em>”</speech>
            </p> 
            <p>
            <narration>Everyone agrees and they all sober up and nod.</narration> <notes>(&larr;study group thinks <humor-tell>laughing</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, and so on are unfitted in this situation)</notes>

        <p>
            <narration>Owen flips open his textbook, which causes Emma and Zoe to burst into laughter.</narration>

<p>Above, it's not that humor <term>generally</term> is a problem in co-op game, practice presentation, or study session. Instead, it's that some humor tells <em>specifically</em> are seen as unfitted.</p>

<p>Since humor tells express intensity of humor, humor tells are a way of thinking about the fittedness of intensity:</p> 
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>The restaurant is having a slow Tuesday, so Jessica is having some fun back-and-forth with the staff as she goes in and out of the kitchen. They’re laughing about elephants—the manager overhears this but doesn’t care. Jessica approaches each table smiling and cheerful.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the manager thinks that humor tells like <humor-tell>optimism</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>raised spirits</humor-tell> is fitted in these circumstances)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>The restaurant is having a slow Tuesday, so Jessica has some fun back-and-forth with the staff as she goes in and out of the kitchen. Over time, their jokes get more complicated, and soon they start putting their arms to their faces like elephant trunks, making elephant trumpets, doubling over with laugher, and they miss someone waiting to be seated.</narration></p> 
    
    <p>
        <narration>The manager raps on the door.</narration> <speech>“Ladies!”</speech> <narration>she says.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the manager decides that humor tells like <humor-tell>loss of situational awareness</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>non-normative behavior</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raised voices</humor-tell>, and <humor-tell>laughter</humor-tell> is <outcome-contrast>unfitted</outcome-contrast> in the situation)</notes>
    </p> 
</div>
    
    <p>In the examples above, the manager thinks <term>low</term>-intensity humor tells are fitted&mdash;and thinks <em>high</em>-intensity humor is unfitted.
    
  

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The point here isn't to decide whether the manager is right or wrong. Instead, the point is to see how our thinking becomes more tangible when we shift <term>away</term> from something abstract, like “humor,” and <em>toward</em> something more specific, like the intensity or combination of individual humor tells.</p> 

</div>
       
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Content.</headline> Humor tells can help us avoid over-emphasizing the importance of <sem-weak>content</sem-weak> to fittedness. If the manager was watching employees doubling over with laughter through a window, it wouldn't matter if she didn't know the content of the humor&mdash;the intensity and combination of humor tells themselves can be seen as unfitted.</p>
           
    
           
    <p>This is often the case. If we're in a lecture or restaurant, we have a clear idea of what physical behavior would be seen as unfitted <callback>(play wrestling, shrieking with laughter, leaping and shouting, and so on)</callback>&mdash;and we have this idea independent of any content.</p>
