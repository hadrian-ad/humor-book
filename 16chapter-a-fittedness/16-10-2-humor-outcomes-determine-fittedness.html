    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor outcomes determine fittedness</h1>
    
   
  
<p>We'll use <a href="../14chapter-humor-outcomes/14-0-humor-outcomes.html">humor outcomes</a> as things that contribute to fittedness, in addition to topics and humor family words.</p>


<div class="listbox">
   <p class="listbox-headline">Humor outcomes</p>
    <p><i>acceptably criticize, achieve catharsis, avoid conflict, change negative emotions into positive ones, control a situation, create rapport, deal with taboo topics, ease tensions, give new perspectives, handle complaints, help one become accepted, make a point, open up a new topic of conversation, reduce defensiveness, reveal a personality trait, reveal a personal view, support an argument, survive in high stress situations, symbolize close ties.</i></p>
    </div>
    
<p>Humor outcomes help us frame questions about fittedness with narrative clarity.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">Instead of asking <callback>“when does <emotions>humor</emotions> fit?”</callback> we can ask more tangible questions—like <callback>“when does <humor-outcome>avoiding conflict</humor-outcome> fit?”</callback> or <humor-outcome>handling a complaint</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reducing defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolizing close ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
</div>

<p>When Justin makes a humor attempt, we can use humor outcomes to see in what ways it fits the situation:</p>
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Justin’s walking out of the English department when Dave catches him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“Justin! The department’s going to get some drinks tonight. You should come!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*shaking head*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>"Thanks, but I’d better pass. The mountain of sobriety, you know, Tantalus and Sisyphus. Maybe another event!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin <humor-outcome>reveals a personality trait</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Dave:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Sure, I get it. Maybe another time, another event then!”</speech></p>
    
    </div>
    
<p>In this example, Justin wants to <humor-outcome>reveal a personality trait</humor-outcome>&mdash;he’s sober. With enough situational relevance, Dave will see this humor attempt as fitted:</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem ; margin-left: " 
     >
 

<p>But <humor-outcome>revealing a personal trait</humor-outcome> isn’t the only humor outcome in this example—Dave also sees Justin’s humor attempt as trying to <humor-outcome>avoid conflict (while declining an invitation)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with a taboo topic (alcoholism)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>support an argument (that he has a valid excuse to decline)</humor-outcome>, and so on:</p>


<img src=../images/16c-images-fittedness/16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness/16-08-1-expanded-concept.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width:20rem ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>By comparison, if Justin makes a funny voice and goes <callback>“NOOOooooOO… thank you,”</callback> Dave wouldn't describe that humor attempt as as straightforwardly <humor-outcome>dealing with taboo topics</humor-outcome> or <humor-outcome>avoiding conflict</humor-outcome>—and so would be less fitted.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Dave’s humor in response to Justin’s humor attempt <callback>(*laughs* "sure, I get it.")</callback> is also fitted. Dave wasn’t laughing at <term>content</term>, like alcoholism—Dave was laughing because he reached <em>humor outcomes</em>.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Dave felt an <humor-outcome>argument was supported</humor-outcome>, he<humor-outcome> gained a new perspective</humor-outcome>, he feels <humor-outcome>Justin revealed a personality trait</humor-outcome>, he feels <humor-outcome>rapport has been created</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
