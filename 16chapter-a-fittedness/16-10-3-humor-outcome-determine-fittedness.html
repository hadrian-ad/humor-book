<p>Yasmin sees Trevor's humor attempt here as efficiently doing many relevant things at once&mdash;and this efficiency is part of why she sees it as fitted.</p>

<p>We understand or tolerate things that are efficient and well-fitted to the situation. This gives them a justification that protects them from pushback.</p>

        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">We saw this earlier with an analogy to placing a garden. People may not see the justification for putting a garden in an unsuitable spot, and so may question why the garden was put there ant not elsewhere.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">By contrast, if we put a garden in a well-fitted spot, people will feel the harmony of interconnected relevance to the decision justifies why the garden is there, and not elsewhere.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">The point here isn't that fittedness should <sem>compel</sem> an action. Instead, the point is that fittedness creates resistance to criticism.</p>

<p>Emotional actions and intentions have degrees of comparative fit to their emotional situation. We can estimate something's "fittedness" by its integration to a situation.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Fittedness focuses on how people <a href="16-01-humor-can-fit-a-situation.html">do react</a> to humor or humor attempts, not how someone thinks they "should" react.</li>
    
    <li>We can estimate fittedness of humor or humor attempts by accounting for relevancy of <a href="16-02-topics-determine-fittedness.html">topics</a>, <a href="16-03-humor-family-words-determine-fittedness.html">humor family words</a>, and <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">humor outcomes</a>. </li>
    
    <li>Higher fittedness is correlated to greater toleration and increased <a href="16-08-humor-outcomes-determine-fittedness.html">emotional activity</a> on an emotion network.</li>
