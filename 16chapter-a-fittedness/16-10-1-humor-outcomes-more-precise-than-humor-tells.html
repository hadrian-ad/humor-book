    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Humor outcomes are more precise than humor tells</h1>
 
<p>When we see a lack of <term>humor tells</term> as unfitted, we can describe the reason as a lack of movement toward <em>humor outcomes</em>:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>The manager wanted Jessica to smile <callback>(because the manager wanted Jessica to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> with customers)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Jessica wanted her manager to smile <callback>(because she wanted Marie to <humor-outcome>change negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Trevor wanted Minh to lighten up <callback>(because he wanted Minh to <humor-outcome>ease</humor-outcome> (his own) <humor-outcome>tension</humor-outcome>)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Sabrina thought Artem should seem less serious <callback>(in order to better help him <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome> with potential matches)</callback>.</li>
    <li>Emma wanted Max to relax <callback>(in order to <humor-outcome>become less defensive</humor-outcome></callback>).</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p>Above, what mattered to people wasn't the humor tells per se, but their ability to reach humor outcomes.</p>
   
   
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">If the manager wants Jessica to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, it doesn't matter if Jessica smiles or not&mdash;what matters is if Jessica can <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">If the manager focused on the lack of smiling <sem-weak>even if</sem-weak> Jessica was <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>, the manager would be confusing the means for the ends!</p> </div>

    <p><headline>Specific.</headline> While it can be helpful to look for humor tells in general, it's also helpful to not miss the forest for the trees.</p> 
    
     <p>Humor outcomes are stable ways of looking for humor. A thousand years ago and a thousand miles away, strangers would arrive for a party and want to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome> with each other&mdash;just like they do today.</p>
    
What matters is whether these outcomes are being reached&mdash;and not be constrained by our expectations around humor tells. Some people in some places may social kiss their friends when arriving at a party, and others won't in other places.  
    
    <p>If we <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, we <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>. We don't need to complain if the expression of this varies&mdash;like if we're used to social kissing (<humor-tell>touching others</humor-tell>) but that's not how it's done where we are.
      
     <p>While it can be helpful to look for humor tells in general, we should recognize when we're confusing a means for an ends.        
       </p>
