<p>We can order these three jokes by order from least to most fitted:</p>

<p>The one that followed on recently relevant topics was most fitted. </p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">When something is more fitted, that doesn't mean it's the best option, funniest, most important, or so on&mdash;it just means its most fitted.</p>

<div class="box">
<p><headline>Focus.</headline> It's the same process to find the fittedness of humor <callback>(an emotion)</callback> as it is a <a href="../15chapter-z-velocity/15-11-humor-attempts.html">humor attempt</a> <callback>(an action)</callback>.</p>  

<p>Even if Hana never smiles in any of the examples above <callback>(humor attempts without humor)</callback>, we could still organize the humor attempts by fittedness.</p>

<p>Similarly, even if Hana smiles because she recognizes Artem <callback>(humor without humor attempts)</callback>, we would still see her humor as more fitted than if she smiles because she thought about cake.</p>
