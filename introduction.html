 <p>My earliest memory of laughing is from when I was six&mdash;I had somehow trapped my arm under a moving treadmill. As the belt scraped skin off me, I yelled until my dad ran in and turned the treadmill off.</p>
 
<p>I sobbed as my dad examined my arm, and then&mdash;he made me laugh.</p> 

<p>I remember not wanting to, but the laugh bubbling out anyway.</p>

<p>This was a special talent of my dad&mdash;my siblings and I would often compare notes about this magic ability of his, to make us laugh when we cried. It seemed inexplicable.</p> 

<p>My dad's odd sense of humor was a frequent topic of conversation and marvel among us&mdash;he could sit through an entire season of a comedy show without laughing once&mdash;but would chuckle when he saw people get hurt&mdash;and could pleasingly summarize books or experiences in ways that would make us laugh.</p>

<p>This was all something beyond easy explanation&mdash;and so, like most people, we admired the mystery and didn't get much further.</p> 

<p>A lot of us hover at that point: admiring the mystery without getting further.</p> 

<p>You've probably noticed that there's something hard to put into words about humor. It can feel like trying to put on a bedsheet that's too small, and whenever we try to pull it over a corner it just pops off somewhere else.</p>

<p>Is humor trivial, or consequential? It is destructive, or constructive? Is it related to lies, or to truth? <i>Pop</i> the bedsheet pops off.</p>

<p>This book is designed to give us the nudge to go deeper, to a place where everything clicks into place&mdash;the Big Understanding of humor.</p>

<p>I spent two decades carefully observing smiling and laughing, and over many interactions and lectures developed a method of teaching and understanding humor&mdash;and this book is the end result.</p> 
  
  <p>You'll learn a useful model of humor that you can carry with you wherever you go&mdash;and it's my hope that re-encountering humor through this book brings you insight, joy, and wonder.</p>
