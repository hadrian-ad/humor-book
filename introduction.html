<p>Have you heard people say you can't teach humor? That's a myth! One that generally describes the speaker more than the subject. <callback>"Humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback></p>


<p>You'll be learning a whole lot about humor in this book! There's probably more to learn than you think&mdash;most readers find the back of the closet is much further away than they suspect. This sense of unexpected exploration is what makes puzzling through humor so rewarding and fun.</p>

<div class="consider">

<!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->

<p>This book is for regular people! It's expected you smile and laugh. But this book is specifically for those insightful enough to have wondered about more&mdash;who to mature their their understanding of things.</p> 

<p>This is achieved through 27 carefully-ordered chapters, which follow over 30 characters through 600 examples and 300 figures.</p> 
</div>

<p>It's one of life's funny tragedies that humor isn't taught more. Just about everyone will raise their hand if you ask them if they've taken a geometry class&mdash;the same can't be said of a humor class.</p> 

<p>The tragedy is that, unlike Euclidean planes, <em>all</em> of our favorite experiences have involved us smiling and laughing. Without instruction, it's then left to our individual science or initiative to make sense of  good experiences.</p>

<p>The result is that most of us are on the backfoot when it comes to all the uses of humor&mdash;making friends, calming tensions, supporting arguments, gauging people's opinions, and so on.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've been observing humor for about two decades, but with a special twist. My observations weren't focused on <callback>"why was that funny?"</callback>&mdash;but instead on <callback>"why did someone laugh?"</callback></p> 

<p>This is an important distinction. We laugh all the time, even outside of "funny" things, like jokes or comedies. As is obvious once we point it out, we sometimes smile and laugh when we:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>put on a shirt hot from the dryer</li>
    <li>bike downhill</li>
    <li>get a really good hug</li>
    <li>see a favorite customer</li>
    <li>hear someone make a good point</li>
    <li>come to a scenic overlook</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>What's the Big Idea that explains the when and why for <em>all</em> instances of smiling and laughing? In other words, how could we explain at one stroke why we smile after <em>both</em> jokes and hugs?</p> 

<p>As we'll see, there are some powerful explanations! We'll be focusing on actually <term>learning</term> these explanations, not just quickly <term2>describing</term2> them. This is a practical course for serious instruction on humor.</p> 
<div class="consider">
    
    <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
    
    <p>Our explanations will be inclusive to the "darker" aspects of humor too. We all know people laugh at more things than just hugs and jokes. Sometimes we laugh after bad news, witnessed cruelty, mean predictions, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p>We'll be explaining <em>all</em> of these smiles and laughs.</p>
</div>


<p>I may be biased&mdash;but I think the study of humor is the root of all good knowledge. I hope to show you why I think so over the course of this book.</p>


<aside class="box">
        <p><headline>Not.</headline> There are a few things this book is not. It's not a scholarly book&mdash;this book will not catch you up on how various academic disciplines have thought about humor.</p> 
        
        <p>That means this also isn't a book about neurochemistry, computational biology, large language models, literary history, or other approaches one might take to humor.</p>
        
        <p>Instead, this is a book of field research&mdash;and of what's knowable about humor just by observation and ordered thinking.</p>

        <headline>About me.</headline> I am a humor theorist and teacher&mdash;my day work is in community-building and placemaking. This underlies my perspectives on humor, which tend to focus first on interpersonal and environmental elements.</p>
        
        <p>I was trained as a professional writer and environmental historian at Carnegie Mellon University, where I worked as a writing consultant for years&mdash;primarily helping engineers write dissertations and research articles. These experiences influenced the style and emphases I chose for this book.</p>
                
        <p>Before that, I was self-taught&mdash;I read full-time for several years while learning to partner dance and host gatherings. This period of exploration gave me some independence of thought, giving me some detachment from received ideas about humor.</p>
        
        <p>I am indebted to Warren Shibles, a forgetten academic I never met. In high school, I came across his self-published and monumentally weird <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;a  work of tilted clarity that set me down this path years ago.</p>

<p>Suspician can be warranted, however. One of my favorite books on how <em>not</em> to write about humor has a pretty unforgettable opening:</p>
 
  <div class="vignette">
  <p>Being around laughing crowds always distrubs me.</p> 
  </div>
  
<p>Now if you're me, you beam and laugh at that statement. What a way to open a book on humor! However, it's a demonstration of of the tug-of-war that has happened over something as charged and foundational as smiling and laughing.</p> 

<p>After all, we've been smiling and laughing since before we could speak or understand words&mdash;before we had teeth&mdash;the subject of humor gets at a primary understanding of ourselves. Hence the tug-of-war.</p>

<p>When I attended university, I was surprised by</p>

  
<p>Welcome to this classic manual to humor&mdash;time and time again, it's left readers with the sticky sense that the world is more beautiful and elegant than they had supposed.</p>
       
<p>Almost all the best experience in our lives have involved smiling and laughing&mdash;and yet, it's not always easy to describe the <i>what, why, when,</i> and <i>how much</i> of it all.</p>
             
<p>It's a bit like trying to describe why we love the music we love&mdash;we open our mouth to try to capture it and the words aren't there. But like music, humor is something that can be taught&mdash;we can learn how to think about and describe it, which suppports <sem-weak>using</sem-weak> it.</p>
             
<p>It's a myth that humor can't be taught. Usually, that describes the speaker more than the subject: <callback>"humor can't be taught (by me)."</callback> Like any subject, we can find good ways to think about it.</p>
              
<p>Readers of this book often attest to the same pleasing quality of "surprising obviousness" to this book&mdash;we re-view familiar experiences and tease out some shared structure between them. It initiates us into a useful and profound way of seeing the world.</p>

 <p>My earliest memory of laughing is from when I was six&mdash;I had somehow trapped my arm under a moving treadmill. As the belt scraped skin off me, I yelled until my dad ran in and turned the treadmill off.</p>
 
<p>I sobbed as my dad examined my arm, and then&mdash;he made me laugh.</p> 

<p>I remember not wanting to, but the laugh bubbling out anyway.</p>

<p>This was a special talent of my dad&mdash;my siblings and I would often compare notes about this magic ability of his, to make us laugh when we cried. It seemed inexplicable.</p> 

<p>My dad's odd sense of humor was a frequent topic of conversation and marvel among us&mdash;he could sit through an entire season of a comedy show without laughing once&mdash;but would chuckle when he saw people get hurt&mdash;and could pleasingly summarize books or experiences in ways that would make us laugh.</p>

<p>This was all something beyond easy explanation&mdash;and so, like most people, we admired the mystery and didn't get much further.</p> 

<p>A lot of us hover at that point: admiring the mystery without getting further.</p> 

<p>You've probably noticed that there's something hard to put into words about humor. It can feel like trying to put on a bedsheet that's too small, and whenever we try to pull it over a corner it just pops off somewhere else.</p>

<p>Is humor trivial, or consequential? It is destructive, or constructive? Is it related to lies, or to truth? <i>Pop</i> the bedsheet pops off.</p>

<p>This book is designed to give us the nudge to go deeper, to a place where everything clicks into place&mdash;the Big Understanding of humor.</p>

<p>I spent two decades carefully observing smiling and laughing, and over many interactions and lectures developed a method of teaching and understanding humor&mdash;and this book is the end result.</p> 
  
  <p>You'll learn a useful model of humor that you can carry with you wherever you go&mdash;and it's my hope that re-encountering humor through this book brings you insight, joy, and wonder.</p>
