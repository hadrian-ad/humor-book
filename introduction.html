  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
 <p>My earliest memory of laughing is very clear&mdash;I was six and foolish. I had trapped my arm under a treadmill, and the belt was scraping off skin. I screamed until my dad ran it and turned the treadmill off.</p>
 
<p>I sobbed as my dad examined my damaged skin, and then&mdash;he made me laugh. I remember not wanting to, but the laugh bubbling out anyway.</p>

<p>This was a special talent of my dad&mdash;my siblings and I would often share notes about this magic ability of his, to make us laugh when we cried. It seemed inexplicable.</p> 

<p>In fact, my dad's odd sense of humor was often a topic of conversation among us&mdash;the way he rarely laughed at comedies, but chuckled when he saw people get hurt&mdash;or the pleasing way he could summarize books or experiences in a way that would make us laugh.</p>

<p>It was something beyond easy explanation&mdash;and so, like most people, we admired the mystery and didn't get much further. A lot of us hover at that point: admiring the mystery without getting further.</p> 

<p>This book is designed to give us the nudge to go deeper, to a place where everything clicks into place&mdash;the Big Understanding of humor.</p>

<p>I've spent two decades taking notes on smiling and laughing, and developing up a method of teaching and understanding humor&mdash;and this book is the end result.</p>

<p>It's my hope that re-encountering humor through this book brings you insight, joy, and wonder.</p>
