    <h3 id="exclude-navigation">Humor attempts</h3>


<p>Velocity is one quality of an intention to generate humor. In this book, we'll call intentions to generate humor <vocab>humor attempts</vocab>.</p>

<div class="consider">
      <p class="consider">consider:</p>
       <p>Whenever we try to make someone show humor tells, push someone into humor tripwires, feel humor family words&mdash;we're making a humor attempt.</p>    
        
    </div>
    
<p>A humor attempt is broader than a joke. A humar attempt includes <em>everything</em>&mdash;not just the words of a joke, but also the intonation, pacing, posture, facial expression, broader situation, and so on.</p> 
         
<p>That means the joke itself would just be <sem-weak>part</sem-weak> of the humor attempt.</p>

    alt="This diagram shows a circle labled 'humor attempt,' with a smaller circle labeled 'joke' within it. An annotation says 'the joke is smaller than the overall humor attempt.'";
    title="Humor attempts";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >
    
    <p>So if a hundred people tell the same joke, they're using <term>one</term> joke but making a <term2>hundred</term2> different humor attempts&mdash;since each person would be:</p> 
    
<ul class="close-list">
        <li>talking to a different person </li>
        <li>using a different inflection</li>
        <li>have a different relation to the joke</li>
        <li>speaking at different times of day</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
   
   
<p>Similarly, humor attempts are <em>anything</em> that intends someone to feel humor. So bringing our partner <sem-weak>tea</sem-weak> can a humor attempt&mdash;if our intention is for them to <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell> or <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell> and <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome> and experience <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>If our partner smiles, it's a <term>successful</term> humor attempt&mdash;if they frown with disappointment, it's an <term2>unsuccessful</term2> humor attempt. Regardless of outcome, it's still a humor attempt if we intended humor.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
     <p>Throughout this book, we'll use "humor attempts" to talk about the broad range of things that intend someone to feel humor.</p>
    
    <p>This includes things that push people toward humor outcomes. When Sam puts on his jacket to go with Jennifer, or Zoe massages Emma's shoulders&mdash;they're making humor attempts! Their goal is for Jennifer and Emma to reach humor tripwires.</p>
</div>
    

   <!-- 
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
        
        <p>Humor attempts have qualities like velocity, intended topics, participants, success or failure, and so on.

<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Relation.</headline> "Humor attempt" has less ambiguity than words like <callback>"joke"</callback> or <callback>"insult"</callback>. Someone can intend <term>grief</term> from a <term>joke</term>, just like they can intend <term2>laughter</term2> from an <term2>insult</term2>.</p> 
    
    <p>By descripting intention first, we can better characterize something without worrying about describing it with a genre word. So when the tutor says <callback>"this is terrible,"</callback> we can simply call it a humor attempt without worrying too much about words like insults or jokes.</p>  
    
       
    
     <p>More importantly, "humor attempts" gives us a way to talk collectively about <sem-weak>everything</sem-weak> we do to generate smiles or laughs. This includes the ones we don't really have names for&mdash;like bringing tea, massaging shoulders, giving sincere compliments, giving sincere criticism, and so on.</p>

<p>Since these observations can go against how we think these interactions are supposed to work, they can seem confusing or mysterious. But it's not so confusing or mysterious once we know how to think about it.</p>

<p>The people in these examples are just making high-velocity humor attempts! They're taking an <a href="../15chapter-tripwires/15-06-it-often-takes-many-steps-before-we-feel-humor.html">outcome-first</a> approach of rushing humor outcome tripwires&mdash;like <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>avoid conflict</humor-outcome>, or so on. The high velocity rushes someone across humor tripwires before those tripwires can be guarded.</p> 

<p>This humor isn't breaking any laws of social physics&mdash;it isn't random, unknowable, or at all outside any normal pattern of humor. It's just humor like it always is.</p>

<p>Still, these these sharp, outcome-first humor attempts might seem like gambles at first&mdash;like they're rolling the dice on whether someone wolud feel anger or humor from these comments.</p> 

<p>But there's actually very little uncalculated gambling&mdash;since everyone had high confidence that the person they were talking to would laugh and not be offended.</p> 

<p>We already know what this feels like&mdash;to <em>know</em> whether or not someone will feel humor before we make a comment:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*putting on tie*</action> <action>*walking into bedroom*</action> <speech>“And how are you today, my little crab cake?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sam knows Jennifer will laugh at this)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“That’s the worst one yet!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action></p>
    </div>
    
<p>When Sam uses a joke nickname with Jennifer, he isn't sweating and crossing his fingers. <callback>("Oh god oh god I hope this lands.")</callback> He already knows Jennifer will laugh!</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider> 
    <p>If Sam thought Jennifer would be annoyed, he wouldn’t have said it. And while he knows it's possible she could be unexpectedly out of sorts, he also feels confident he could adapt to that outcome.</p>
</div> 

<p>This feeling of future-confidence is the same feeling everyone in our examples had. Each person made a high-velocity humor attempt in a situation they had lots of practice with:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>Elias often flirts with strangers</li>
    <li>Amber often comments on the physical appearances of strangers</li>
    <li>Emma is often direct with people</li>
    <li>the waiter deals with dozens of customers each day</li>
    <li>Timothy delivers bad news to patients all the time</li>
    <li>the tutor works with many students each day</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>This constant practice gave them an advance sense of the outcome. In the same way Sam and Jennifer's constant interaction gives them high confidence in outcomes of what they say, the tutor's constant interaction with clients lets them have high confidence in outcomes.</p>

<p>These comments only <term>appear</term> to be acts of courageous spontaneity <term2>if</term2> we see them as an isolated, single instance&mdash;instead of part of a practiced skills.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    
    <consider>For instance:</consider>
    
    <p>If we watched a baseball game and thought all the college athletes were playing for the first time, it would seem like an astonishing, out-of-the-blue miracle to watch them catch a fly ball.</p>
    
    <p>But that's not how we watch college baseball. Instead, we know the players have spent a decade practicing those specific skills. We're still <sem-weak>impressed</sem-weak> by their dedication and upper-end perfomance&mdash;but we don't think their skills arrived mysteriously from nowhere that very moment.</p>
             
    <p>It's the same thing for humor. It's not an astonishing miracle when Amber makes the server laugh. <callback>("You look terrible.")</callback> It only looks that way if we think the ability to do so arrived mysteriously from nowhere that very moment. Instead, like a baseball player, Amber has spent years or even decades practicing these contextual skill.</p>
</div>

<p>The tutor knows in advance which student will respond in which way&mdash;because with enough clients and practice, the tutor develops an intuitive understanding of which client will defend which tripwires on which topics.</p>

   <div class="for-instance">
    <consider>For instance:</consider>
    
    <p>If a client is arrogant, controlling, demanding, defensive, proud, and so on, the client may resist being rushed across <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome> tripwire. In this case, the tutor may focus first on <humor-outcome>creating rapport</humor-outcome>.</p> 
    
    <p>But if a client seems to be looking for advice, is nervous, unsure of what to do, uncertain of the quality of their work, open to suggestions, and so on&mdash;then the tutor may judge that they can rush them across <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome> tripwires in a way the student will appreciate and find productive and positive.</p> </div>

<p>It’s the same for the other examples. Elias, Emma, Amber, Timothy, and the waiter knew in advance how the specific people they were talking too would react. They knew what the likely outcome would be, and were confident they could handle outlier outcomes.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>Sometimes outcome-first humor like this confuses us because of its apparent negativity. <callback>(“You look terrible.”)</callback> But our confusion is caused by an incorrect assumption: that we only feel humor at “good” things, and that we shouldn't feel humor at “bad” things.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>But as we’ve seen, humor doesn’t distinguish straightforwardly between “good” and “bad.” All that matters is how much something deviates from our expectations, and whether that’s matched by our sense of security from negative personal consequences.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>If the server feels secure from negative personal consequences, we don’t need to think about ideas like “good” or “bad.” Questions like <callback>“was it good or bad for Amber to make that comment?”</callback> or <callback>"is it good or bad to be told we look terrible?"</callback> aren't relevant to thinking about why someone does or doesn't feel humor.</p>    
    
    </div>
    
<p>We can probably find places in our own lives where others would view our own humor skills as miraculous&mdash;we just don’t notice this because these skills seem so utterly normal to us. These might be how we interact with:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
  <li>our partner</li>
   <li>new coworkers</li>
    <li>freshmen teammates</li>
    <li>young children</li>
    <li>patients</li>
    <li>long-standing clients</li>
    <li>online friends</li>
    <li>social media comments</li>
    <li>vendors</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>We’ve picked up an ability to gauge outcomes around these people through experience, exposure, feedback, opportunity, practice, and so on. This lets us act in ways that can seem miraculous to others&mdash;especially if someone confuses our years of familiarity and practice for some kind of exceptional, one-off ability.</p> 

<p>By themselves, these sharper skills with humor are neither good nor bad. Sometimes they’re used for negative manipulation. Other times, we start relying on them, and we fall into a rut that prevents us from practicing other ways of relating to others. And sometimes we overextend ourselves&mdash;or trick ourselves into thinking we’re better at a sharp social skill than we really are.</p> 

<div class="consider"><consider>Consider:</consider> 
    <p>Sometimes we can generate a laugh in the moment, and so think we're "good" at sharp humor.</p> 
     
     <p>But we don't always realize or know if the humor is later followed by mistake-predominant emotions&mdash;which would make us less good at sharp humor than it seems to us in that moment.</p> 
      
 </div>

<p>What <sem-weak>is</sem-weak> good is understanding how all this happens. It can help us deal with the humor we feel unexpectedly from high-velocity experiences, including when it’s part of negative manipulation&mdash;as well as reduce how often we're confused or surprised by someone's humor or humor attempts.</p>

<p>We can expand our spatial metaphor of humor  <callback>("tripwires")</callback> by thinking of evaluatory actions as vectors.</p> 

<ul>
    <li>
    These vectors can have different <a href="15-07-we-can-push-toward-humor-tripwires-fast-or-slowly.html">velocity</a>. This velocity influences whether and at what timescale someone reaches a humor outcomes.

    <li>
    High-velocity actions can quickly reach humor tripwires&mdash;unless they "miss," in which case they can quickly reach <a href="15-09-more-velocity-is-not-alway-better.html">mistake-predominant</a> emotions.
