<p>Above, people tried to make low-velocity jokes. Since these didn't take the most direct route to humor outcomes, they were easily deflected. The higher-velocity alternatives managed to avoid being mired within the broader situation.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">The point here isn’t that rushing humor outcomes is a magic method to generating humor&mdash;because it’s not! High-velocity comments are good at generating <sem>all kinds</sem> of emotions. We could just as easily imagine people being <term>annoyed</term> instead of <em>amused</em> by high-velocity comments.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Generating humor by rushing tripwires requires favorable conditions, judgment, luck, practice, skill, and so on&mdash;all under the greater pressure created from raising the stakes with more velocity.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Instead, the point here is to understand how and why humor happens when it happens&mdash;even in some initially confusing situations.</p>
