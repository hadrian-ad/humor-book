    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">More velocity isn't always better</h2>
    
<p>Having more velocity isn’t always better&mdash;and, in fact, often isn’t.</p> 

 <p>In part, that's because what makes a high-velocity push effective at generating <term>humor</term> also makes it more effective at generating <term2>mistake-predominant</term2> emotions:</p>

    <p>Low-velocity comments are easily deflected, which gives people more choice in how they react to them.</p>

        <p>By contrast, high-velocity comments are hard to deflect, and so <em>don't</em> always allow for a choice of outcomes. 
        For the same reason it's hard to resist <term>humor</term> from high-veloctiy comments, it hard to resist <term2>negative</term2> feelings.
        </p>

    alt="This image compares two vector figures. It notes a harder push makes it harder to guard against all emotions, not just humor. By contrast, a lighter push makes it easier to guard against all emotions, not just humor.";

    style="max-width: 40rem ; margin-left: ;margin-top: 1rem;" 
     >

<p>That means low-velocity comments have a buffer to both good and bad outcomes&mdash;since what makes it easy to guard against <term>shame</term> also makes it easy to guard against <term2>humor</term2>.</p>

        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>    
         <p class="considertext">Velocity by itself isn’t good or bad, effective or ineffective. Knowing how much velocity to use requires awareness, experience, discretion, judgment, and so on&mdash;something we develop through experience and observation.</p>

 <aside class="box"><p><headline>Nothing.</headline> We can sometimes let people walk themselves into humor outcome tripwires&mdash;since some situations have enough movement on their own that people simply drift themselves into a tripwire:</p> 
     
     <div class="vignette">
             <p><narration>Trevor is talking to Minh about Yasmin. She has her job offer in another city and he was accepted to grad school, and he doesn’t know how to balance any of that with their relationship. Minh takes a sip of beer, listening.</narration></p>
             <p><narration>Trevor continues, talking about his lab, and how he’s suddenly less interested in research and has been thinking of going into industry, which is confusing to him. Minh continues to listen as Trevor talks.</narration></p> 
             
             <p><narration>Trevor finally sighs and smiles with a feeling of relief.</narration> “Thanks for listening, man.” <notes>(&larr;Minh allows Trevor to walk himself into outcome tripwires of <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <humor-outcome>changing negative emotions into positive emotions</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport,</humor-outcome> and so on)</notes></p>
             <p>Minh: <speech>“Yeah, no problem. You have an interesting set of stuff going on. Let me know whatever I can do to help.”</speech></p>
             <p>Trevor: <action>*smiles*</action> “Well. Thanks.”</p>
         </div>
     
     <p>Minh helps Trevor generates humor by doing nothing. Humor tripwires can help us forecast when this will happen&mdash;like when people are clearly leading up to <humor-outcome>supporting (their own) arguments</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling (their own) complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolizing close ties (with themselves)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>easing (their own) tension</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>
