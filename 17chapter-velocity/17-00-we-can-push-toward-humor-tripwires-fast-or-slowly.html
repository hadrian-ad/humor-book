<p>Last chapter we talked about using a <a href="../15chapter-tripwires/15-00-tripwires-a.html#exclude-navigation">spatial metaphor</a> to think through emotional situations.</p> 
    
     <p>In this chapter, we can expand this metaphor by thinking about the situational ball as having <vocab>velocity</vocab>.</p>

<p>The <term>harder</term> we press toward humor outcomes, the <term>more</term> velocity on the ball. The <term2>lighter</term2> we press, the <term2>less</term2> velocity:</p>

    <p>Above, when someone was <term>direct</term> about reaching a humor outcome, they <term>increased</term> the velocity. When they were <term2>indirect</term2>, they <term2>decreased</term2> the velocity.</p>
