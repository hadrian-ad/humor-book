       <p class="overtitle">Evaluatory Information</p>
       
</div>

    
<p>Last chapter, we talked about <a href="../10chapter-emotion-network/10-0-emotion-network.html">emotion networks</a>&mdash;how people shared information with each other.</p>

<p>But emotion networks share a particular kind of information: <vocab>evaluatory information</vocab>. This is information about mistakes and OKs:</p>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Trevor sees General Zod run to the window and stand there stiffly at alert.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor receives information about Zod's mistakes and OKs)</notes>
</p>
</div>

    <img src=../images/11c-images-evaluatory-information/11-0-evaluatory-information/11-0-0-radiate-information.png

    alt="This image shows an evaluation network of two circles with arrows radiating out, surrended by a dashed line. The arrows are labled 'we radiate evaluatory information,' while the line is labled 'emotion network is an exchange of evaluatory information'";
    title="Evaluatory information";
    style="max-width: 17rem ; margin-left: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem; " 
     >

<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Minh looks at a row of people on the bus, each of who is staring at their phone.</narration>
</p>

<p><narration>One has a wide smile of delight.</narration></p>

<p>
    <narration>One has a quiet smile.</narration>
</p> 

<p>
    <narration>One is not smiling at all.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Minh receives information about passengers' mistakes and OKs)</notes>
</p>
</div>


<p>Above, Minh can't see what people are looking at on their phones, so he doesn't know <sem-weak>what</sem-weak> people are evaluating&mdash;but he picks up on their evaluations of it anyway. </p>

<p>In other words, even though he doesn't know <term>what</term> they see <callback>(he doesn't have information about content)</callback>, he still knows how they <em>feel</em> about what they see <callback>(he does have information about evaluations)</callback>.</p>

<p>We'll be going over this in more detail throughout this chapter.</p>
