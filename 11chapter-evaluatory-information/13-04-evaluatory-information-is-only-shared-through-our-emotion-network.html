<p>Above, multiple people can survey each other's emotional state in just a few seconds. This is a huge amount of information, shared very quickly!</p>

<div class="consider">
     <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">To see how efficient and dense this exchange of information is, we can compare sitauations&mdash;like when Emma, Zoe, Owen, Minh, and Trevor are:</p> 
     
     <ul class="consider-list">
           <li>all in the <term>same</term> room and spend two seconds to <term>glance</term> at each other <callback>(full emotion network)</callback></li>
        <li>are all in <em>different</em> rooms and spend two seconds to try to <em>text</em> their reaction to each other <callback>(constrained emotion network)</callback></li>
            </ul>
     
     <p class="considertext">In the first case, everyone could convey their own opinion, while also gathering the nuanced stance of everyone involved, in two seconds</p>
     
     <p class="considertext">In the second case, everyone could barely type two words in two seconds&mdash;let alone also learn much about everyone else's emotional state.</p>

    <p>When we look at pictures, we can see how just a quick glance is enough to get the gist of everyone's emotional state:</p>

    <p><headline>Constraint.</headline> An emotion network is accessed with degrees of fullness.

    <p>The more constrained an emotion network is, the less evaluatory information it shares.
