    <h1 id="11-03">Content and evaluations aren't the same</h1>
    
   
<p>We sometimes think <term>content</term> information and <em>evaluatory</em> information always travel together, but they don't:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma is sniffling on the bus from sadness, her eyes red. The people around her are aware that she’s sad.</narration> <notes>(&larr;strangers can pick up on Emma’s evaluatory information, but not the content Emma is evaluating)</notes></p>

<div class="vignette">
 <p><narration>Zoe is on a plane to Brazil. She looks up at the movie playing a few seats ahead of her. It's just a close-up of a man's face reacting to things off-screen. Maybe someone is talking to him? She has no idea of the context.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe can pick up on actor's evaluatory information, but not the content he's evaluating)</notes></p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>General Zod continues to stand at alert. Trevor keeps an eye on him staring out the window.

<p>Justin can’t give an entire history lecture by just smiling and frowning for fifty minutes. The class would learn nothing about British Literature!</p>

     <p class="considertext">Justin can't smile to convey which 19th century book he was thinking about, the date it was published, findings by comparative scholarly studies, or so on.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">All his smile conveys is how he <sem>feels</sem> about those things.</p>

<p>That's because a smile conveys <term>evaluatory</term> information, and <outcome-contrast>can't</outcome-contrast> convey <em>content</em> information.




<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Degrees.</headline> We often notice when evaluatory information gets stripped&mdash;like by comparing speech with text messages:</p>
