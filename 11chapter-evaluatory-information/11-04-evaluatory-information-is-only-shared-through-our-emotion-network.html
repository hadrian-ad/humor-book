<p>Above, multiple people can survey each other's emotional state in just a few seconds. This is a huge amount of information, shared very quickly!</p>

         <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
         
         <p class="considertext">To see how efficient and dense this exchange of information is, we can compare sitauations&mdash;like when Emma, Zoe, Owen, Minh, and Trevor are:</p>

               <li>all in the <term>same</term> room and spend two seconds to <term>glance</term> at each other <callback>(full emotion network)</callback></li>
            <li>are all in <term2>different</term2> rooms and spend two seconds to try to <term2>text</term2> their reaction to each other <callback>(constrained emotion network)</callback></li>
                </ul>
         
         <p class="considertext">In the first case, everyone could convey their own opinion, while also gathering the nuanced stance of everyone involved, in two seconds</p>
         
         <p class="considertext">In the second case, everyone could barely type two words in two seconds&mdash;let alone also learn much about everyone else's emotional state.</p>
