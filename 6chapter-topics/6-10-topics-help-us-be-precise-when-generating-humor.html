Topics help us be precise when generating humor
</h1>
 
<p>
	We don't need to hear a joke to laugh. Sam laughs below, even though Jennifer doesn't do anything "funny:"
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Sam is examining his balding head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</narration>
	<speech>“You look so
	    <term>handsome</term>,”</speech> <narration>she says, squeezing him.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer identifies that Sam has a medium mistake on a topic related to physical self-esteem)</notes>
</p>
<p>
	<narration>Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer shifts Sam’s OK to match the medium mistake on this topic)</notes>
</p>
    </div>
<p>
	Jennifer wants Sam to feel humor. But more specifically, she wanted him to feel humor
	<em>
		on a specific topic.
	</em>
	 She wants the topic 'Sam's physical self-esteem' to generate humor.
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">It matters which topic generates humor. Jennifer could make Sam laugh by telling him a joke about a burrito—but even though Sam would laugh at both an affirmation and a joke, the results from each would be different.</p>

<p class="considertext">That's because it matters which topic generates humor—the outcome is different whether it's a topic 'burrito' or a topic 'physical self-esteem' generating Sam's humor.
    </p>
    </div>
    
<p>
	To shift Sam's evaluations into balance, Jennifer didn't try to do anything conventionally funny at all. That's because her goal <em>isn't</em> actually to be funny, but to balance mistakes and OKs—and there are many ways to do that.
</p>
<p>
	In this case, Jennifer used an affirmation or compliment to raise Sam's OK—she made him feel more secure from negative personal consequences. A joke would probably have been less effective on this particular topic at an balancing mistakes and OKs.
</p>
<p>
	When we have situational goals, we have to be <term>precise</term> about which topics we activate and focus on. Like Jennifer, we can generate generate humor in a way that's both connected to and emerging out of someone’s life—which can influence people in positive ways.

        We often use a "particle" model of humor, where humor happens because a joke "lands" or "hits our funny bone" or "strikes" us a certain way. We're using a different high-level model of humor—we can read about this in this chapter's

    We can segment our global evaluation into arbitrary sets of distinct evaluations. We'll call these arbitrary segments <term>topics</term>, which label our evaluation graphs.

        <li>
            Topics are either<strong><a href="6-2-topics-alternate-between-being-active-and-inactive.html"> active or inactive</a></strong>, depending on whether we're evaluating mistakes and OKs for them in a particular moment.

            Topics help us think about<strong><a href="6-4-topics-give-emotional-continuity.html">
                    evaluatory continuity</a></strong>, even when no two situations are exactly alike. This helps us track how past evaluations are involved in present moments of humor.
