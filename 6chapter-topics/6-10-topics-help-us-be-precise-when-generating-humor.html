Topics help us be precise when generating humor</h2>
 
<p>
	We don't need to hear a joke to laugh. Sam laughs below, even though Jennifer doesn't do anything "funny:"
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <narration>Sam is examining his balding head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</narration>
        <speech>“You look so <em>handsome</em>,”</speech> <narration>she says, squeezing him.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer identifies that Sam has a medium mistake on a topic related to physical self-esteem)</notes>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer shifts Sam’s OK to match the medium mistake on this topic)</notes>
    </p>
</blockquote>
    </div>
<p>
	Jennifer wants Sam to feel humor. But more specifically, she wanted him to feel humor
	on a <em>specific topic</em>&mdash;she wants the topic 'Sam's physical self-esteem' to generate humor.
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <consider>Consider:</consider>
        <p>It matters which topic generates humor. Jennifer could make Sam laugh by giving him an affirmation <callback>(of her good opinion of him)</callback> or telling him a joke <callback>(about a burrito)</callback>&mdash;but even though Sam would laugh at both, the emotional results from each would be different.</p>
        
        <p>That's because it matters which topic generates humor&mdash;the outcome is different whether the topic 'burrito' or the topic 'physical self-esteem' generates Sam's humor.
        </p>
    </aside>
    </div>
    
<p>
	To shift Sam's evaluations into balance, Jennifer didn't try to do anything conventionally funny at all. That's because her goal isn't actually to be "funny", but to balance mistakes and OKs&mdash;and there are many ways to do that.
</p>
<p>
	In this case, Jennifer used an <term>affirmation</term> to raise Sam's OK&mdash;since an affirmation helped  him feel more secure from negative personal consequences. A <term2>joke</term2> would have had a narrow path on this particular topic at balancing mistakes and OKs.

            When we have situational goals, we have to be precise about which topics we activate and focus on.</p> 
            
            <p>Like Jennifer, we can generate humor in a way that's both connected to and emerging out of someone’s life&mdash;which can influence people in positive ways.

    A deeper look (Particles vs looms)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">
   
<p>We can look at two different high-level metaphorical models for humor:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li><strong>A “particle” model of humor.</strong> In this metaphorical model, humor is like a <term>particle</term> that’s emitted by something&mdash;and a humor particle strikes us, we feel humor. Humor is something that comes to us from <term2>outside</term2> of us.</li> 
    
    <li><strong>A “loom” model of humor.</strong> In this metaphorical model, our experiences are a <term>weave</term> of associations, which creates a kind of emotional fabric&mdash;whether we feel anger, humor, or so on depends on what is woven together, and how. Humor is something that comes from <term2>within</term2> us.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Our default way of thinking and talking about humor is usually a “particle” model. We might start watching a show, which tries to  “land” jokes that “hit” us right&mdash;and it all seems to be something done to us, from outside of us.</p>

<p>The problem with a particle model is that it works less well once we go beyond performers and passive audiences&mdash;like when we feel humor:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>while just lying on the couch</li>
    <li>when someone is angry at us</li>
    <li>when someone compliments us</li>
    <li>by waking up looking forward to the day</li>
    <li>off and on while having a conversation with a friend</li>
</ul>

  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>In these cases, the "loom" model is more inclusive to more experiences, and explains them more completely. Something is happening within us that explains the humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
  <aside class="consider">
          <consider>Consider:</consider>
        
        <p>At first, a metaphor like “internal weaving” can feel unwieldy. But the interaction of our attention, evaluations, expectations, memories, observations, thoughts, and so on does create an analogy to a loom:</p>
        
            <img class="img-indent"
            src="../images/closer-look/cl-looms-vs-particles/cl-0-loom-internal-loom.png"
            title="Comparing 'loom fabric' to 'emotional fabric'"
            alt="This image compares 'fabric woven on loom' with 'emotional fabric woven on internal loom.' One shows the verticle lines of warp with the connecting meander of the weft. The other figure shows a grid of topic circles, with a line of focus going through them activating them in a way that mimics the weft of the fabric."
            style="max-width:23rem;">
            
        <p>This metaphorical internal loom makes up the “fabric” of experiences.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>These metaphorical models <callback>("particles" "looms")</callback> don’t matter so much in themselves&mdash;they’re not meant to be <term>practical</term>. Instead, they’re meant to be <term2>framing</term2>&mdash;big-picture methods of how we orient our thoughts about humor.</p> 

<p>Depending on which model we use, our methods and observations of humor change.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>For instance:</consider>
    
    <aside class="consider">
        <p>If we think that generating humor is a bit like shooting bottles on a fence <callback>(particle model)</callback>, the word humor will make us think about jokes or things that seem to straightforwardly contain or deliver humor.</p>  
        
        <p>But if we think that generating humor is a bit like weaving <callback>(loom model)</callback>, we’ll think more broadly about humor&mdash;as something embedded and created within a situation, with jokes only sometimes relevant to this process.</p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>We saw this with Elias, who found jokes themselves to be flat <callback>(particle model)</callback>. But when he combined those jokes with elements of his life, he felt more intricate, situationally-connected humor <callback>(loom model)</callback>.</p>

<p>When Jennifer made Sam laugh, she didn’t use a joke or anything funny or odd <callback>(particle model)</callback>&mdash;instead, she helped topics be active together, like ‘Sam’s physical appearance’ and ‘Jennifer’s opinion of him’&mdash;and shifted both of them together to generate humor <callback>(loom model)</callback>. Jennifer didn't <term>transmit</term> humor so much as helped <term2>weave</term2> it within Sam.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <aside class="consider">
        <p>Jennifer would handicap herself if she approached Sam as if he was a bottle she was trying to shoot with jokes.</p> 
        
        <p>That metaphor would shift focus away from Sam and onto things external to him&mdash;or even onto Jennifer herself. <callback>(“What can *I* do to unilaterally force Sam to feel humor?”</callback> instead of <callback>“what does *Sam* need to have happen for him to feel humor?”)</callback></p>
    </aside>
</div> 

<p>The point isn't that we should spend lots of time thinking about these high-level metaphors. Instead, the point is to catch the general approach to this book&mdash;which is <term>less</term> “what makes a joke funny” <callback>(particle model)</callback> and <term2>more</term2> “what about someone makes a joke funny to them?” <callback>(Loom model.)</callback> </p> 

<p>That’s why we won’t be focusing on jokes so much as we will on the thing <sem-weak>behind</sem-weak> jokes&mdash;the emotional fabric that we’ll want to be able to read and work on.</p>

<p>As we do this, we'll learn how to generate humor with the help of things we don’t always think of as “humor”&mdash;like arguments, compliments, favors, gifts, gratitude, insults, looks, needling, rough-housing, teasing, timing, and so on. Sometimes we can even generate humor by choosing to do nothing at all.</p>

<p>This will be a fulfilling, powerful way of approaching humor. Instead of looking at humor through a straw, by focusing only on jokes&mdash;we'll broaden the horizons of our skills and deepen their effect by focusing on the internal happenings within people. </p>
