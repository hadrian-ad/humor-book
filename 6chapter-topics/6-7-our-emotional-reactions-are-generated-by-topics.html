Topics make our emotional reactions
</h1>
  
<p>
	We'll use topics in this book to discuss emotions—whether emotionally straightforward topics <callback>(‘houseplant’)</callback>
	or emotionally complex clusters of topics <callback>(‘Jennifer’s illness’)</callback>.
</p>
<p>
	For instance, when Yasmin gets a job offer, she feels all kinds of things:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
<narration>Yasmin gets a job offer in Columbus.
	    </narration></p>
<p>
	<strong>
		A.
	</strong> <narration>The idea of moving to a big city for a better job is exciting, and it’s something that makes her laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr; mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		B.
	</strong> <narration>On the other hand, it’s also terrifying! It makes her feel incredibly sober and nervous.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		C.
	</strong> <narration>But then she thinks about how cool it is she actually got the job offer?! She laughs and feels powerful for a while.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		D.
	</strong>
	<narration>Then she wrings her hands. What about her family here? What about Trevor? Why would she leave them?</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is not OK&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>
		E.
	</strong> <narration>But won’t she have money now to go visit? She imagines having discretionary income, and laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;mistake is OK&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p> 
    <p>
	    <narration>She goes back and forth all day.</narration>
	</p>

	We can annotate Yasmin’s experience using topics. She has a through-topic of 'job offer,' which has other topics activating and deactivating alongside it, which leads to a rapidly changing emotional state:
