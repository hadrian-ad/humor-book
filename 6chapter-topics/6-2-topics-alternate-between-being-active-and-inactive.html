     Topics alternate between being active and inactive 
</h1>
  
<p>
	We're not evaluating everything all the time. Instead, we evaluate a few things for a while, and then switch to evaluate other things.  
</p>
	
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
	    
	    <p class="for-instance-text">We don’t hear a joke and then spend the rest of our lives continuously evaluating it. Instead, we evaluate the joke for a while and then our attention goes to something else.
	        </p>
	        </div>
    <p>
	When we're paying attention to a topic, we're evaluating it. When we're evaluating a topic, it's <vocab>active</vocab>—otherwise, that topic is <vocab>inactive</vocab>:
</p>

<p>
	We cycle through active topics as our attention changes:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<strong>A.</strong> <narration>Trevor's ears prick as he hears the mail being delivered. It sounds like a big lump of mail today!</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor is making evaluations on topic 'mail,' so that topic is active)</notes>
    </p>
<p>
	<strong>B.</strong> <narration>Trevor goes back to his game. He has got to find a way to beat the Time Magistrate.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor is no longer making evaluations on topic 'mail,' so that topic becomes inactive)</notes>
</p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<strong>A.</strong> <narration>Zoe is watching a video on her phone.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic ‘video’ is active)</notes>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>B.</strong> <narration>She’s interrupted by a phone call from her mother.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic ‘Carol’ is active)</notes>
</p>
<p>
	<strong>C.</strong> <narration>After hanging up, Zoe goes back to her video.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic ‘video’ is active again)</notes>
</p>
    </div>

    title=""
    alt=""
    style="max-width:28rem;">


<p>Multiple topics can also be active at the same time:</p>
<div class="vignette">
	<p>
		<strong>A.</strong> <narration>Emma is eating on the couch when her roommate, Jessica, joins her.</narration> <notes>(&larr; Emma's topic 'Jessica' is active)</notes>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>B.</strong> <narration>Jessica's boyfriend, Elias, comes out of the bathroom and joins them too.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma's topic 'Jessica' and 'Elias' are active)</notes>
	</p>
	<p>
		<strong>C.</strong> <narration>Elias' leaves, and Zoe calls Emma.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma's topic 'Jessica' and 'Zoe' are active)</notes>
	</p>
    </div>
    
        <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-2-topics-alternate-between-being-active-and-inactive/6-2-3-jessica-elias-emma.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
    style="max-width:25rem;">

    
    <div class="box">
		<p><headline>Timeline and presentation.</headline> All topics are inactive for periods of time. For instance, even though Zoe's conversation with Ryan was <term>frequently</term> active, it wasn't <em>always</em> on her mind all the time.</p>
	    
	    <p>So if we were to graph both the active and inactive periods of this topic, we'd have gaps between the evaluatory change, where no evaluation is happening.</p>
	
	    <img 
    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-2-topics-alternate-between-being-active-and-inactive/6-2-4-box-inactive-topics.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
    style="max-width:35rem; margin-top: .5rem">
    
    <p>
		In this book, our graphs will often ignore these inactive periods, and just focus on the <sem>active</sem> periods of a topic—with the goal of keeping these informal graphs easy to read at a glance.
