Topics help think about short and long timescales
</h2>
<p>
	To explain humor, we often need to include both a short and long timescale:

        <speaker>Middle School Emma:</speaker> <speech>“So what. Ryan? He’s a douchebag! It’s a miracle he’s ever finished a 100 meter dash, since I don’t think he can count past 10.”</speech>

<!--    ADD IMAGE: A timeline of where humor happens-->
<p>
So what caused Zoe's humor in the variations above: her <term>initial</term> experience with Ryan, which was immediately followed by <term>mistake-predominant emotions</term>&mdash;or her <term2>later</term2> experience with Emma, which was immediately followed by <term2>humor</term2>? 
</p>
<p>
	We have a chicken-or-the-egg scenario&mdash;since <em>both</em> required each other for there to be that moment of humor!
</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <p class="consider">
            <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
            <p>
                On one hand, if Zoe hadn't had her experience with <term>Ryan</term>, she and Emma would never had had the later discussion that ended in humor <callback>(long view)</callback>.</p> 
                
                <p>On the other hand, if <term2>Emma</term2> hadn't precipitated a shift in Zoe's evaluations and topics, Zoe wouldn't felt humor <callback>(short view)</callback>.
            </p>
    </aside>
</div>

<p>
	Both the short view and the long view were necessary for this particular moment of humor&mdash;these two timescales together explain an emotion of humor better than one timescale does alone.
</p>



<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Matches and kindling.</headline> Both the short view and the long view cause humor, but sometimes we <sem-weak>only</sem-weak> talk about the short view&mdash;since it can be easier to talk about. We tell a joke, they laugh&mdash;and the joke seems to "cause" the humor.</p>
            
                <p>But this is a bit like saying a match causes a fire. That can be true&mdash;without also changing the fact that without anything to light, there would be no fire!</p>
            <p>
                Throughout this book, we'll want to be able to understand how the short view and long view together explain moments of humor. Focusing on one view is helpful&mdash;but focusing on both is most helpful.
