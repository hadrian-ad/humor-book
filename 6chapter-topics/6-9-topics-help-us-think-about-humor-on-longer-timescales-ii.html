Topics help us think about short and long views 
</h1>
<p>
	To explain humor, we often need to include both a short and long timescale:
</p>

	<narration>Middle school Zoe has a huge crush on Ryan from the boy’s track team. She keeps trying to start a text conversation with him, until he finally gets annoyed.</narration>

<!--    ADD IMAGE: A timeline of where humor happens-->
<p>
So what caused Zoe's humor in the variations above: her <term>initial</term> experience with Ryan, which was immediately followed mistake-predominant—or her <em>later</em> experience with Emma, which was immediately followed by humor? 
</p>
<p>
	We have a chicken-or-the-egg scenario—since both required each other for there to be that moment of humor!
</p>
<p>
	On one hand, if Zoe hadn't had her experience with <term>Ryan</term>, she and Emma would never had had the later discussion that ended in humor <callback>(long view)</callback>. On the other hand, if <em>Emma</em> hadn't precipitated a shift in Zoe's evaluations and topics, Zoe wouldn't felt humor <callback>(short view)</callback>.
</p>
<p>
	So both the short view and the long view were necessary for this particular moment of humor! These two timescales together explain an emotion of humor better than one timescale does alone.
</p>



<div class="box">
<p><headline>Matches and kindling.</headline> Both the short view and the long view cause humor, but sometimes we <sem-weak>only</sem-weak> talk about the short view—since it's easier to talk about. We tell a joke, they laugh, and so the joke seems to "cause" the humor.</p>
		
			<p>But this is a bit like saying a match causes a fire. That can be true—without also changing the fact that without anything to light, there would be no fire!</p>
        <p>
			Throughout this book, we'll want to be able to understand how the short view and long view together explain moments of humor. Focusing on one view is helpful—but focusing on both is most helpful.
