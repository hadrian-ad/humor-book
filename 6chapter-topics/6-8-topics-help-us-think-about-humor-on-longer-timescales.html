Topics help think about long timescales
</h1>
  
<p>
	We can also use topics to think about humor on a longer timescale than we usually do—like the humor we feel days after we hear a joke:

    alt="This focus diagram has two columns, one for topic 'joke' and topic 'Jessica'. At A, 'joke' is active, with an arrow leading to an emotional state box filled with annoyance. At B, 'Jessica' is active, leading to an emotional state filled with boredom. At C, topics 'joke' and 'Jessica' are active, leading to an emotional state box filled with humor. An annotation says 'joke isn't involved in any feeling of humor until long after it's heard.'"

	Elias doesn't feel much humor when he <term>first</term> hears the jokes. But the jokes were required for a <em>later</em> moment of humor. 
</p>
<p>
	So there's a relevant <term>short</term> timescale <callback>(something Elias observes, which is immediately followed by humor)</callback> and a relevant <em>long</em> timescale <callback>(something that laid the groundwork for Elias' present humor)</callback>.
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We sometimes think of humor as something that happens primarily on a <term>short</term> timescale, like a few seconds—like someone tells us a joke, and then we laugh. But to fully understand humor, we also need to be able to think about a <em>long</em> timescale too, including days or weeks or even years.</p>
</div>

    
    <div class="box">
		<p><headline>Agency and calibration.</headline> When Elias was spoon-fed wordplay and didn’t always have the situational flexibility to generate humor. When he just listened to a comedian, he didn't have the time or flexibility to balance his mistakes and OKs.</p>
	
	<p>But when he was dynamically interacting with the world, he <sem>did</sem> have the flexibility to generate humor. He had the agency to balance his evaluations and generate humor.</p>
	
<p>We experience this all the time. Watching a comedy in a movie theater can feel like a brittle experience—it's either funny or it's not. If we're not feeling much humor in a movie theater, there's not much we can do about it—we're stuck there.</p>
	
<p>But when we watch a comedy at <sem-weak>home</sem-weak> with friends that's not funny, we have more agency—so we can adapt and generate humor no matter what. We do this by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="indepth">
				talking during dull parts
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				venting via text
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				mocking characters
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				supplementing flat humor with our own commentary
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				exclaiming together
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				ordering pizza 
			</li>
            <li class="indepth">
				reading about the movie online 
			</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
		
<p>The same way flexibility lets us tailor humor out of a <term>movie</term>, flexibility lets us tailor humor out of <em>any</em> experience.</p>
