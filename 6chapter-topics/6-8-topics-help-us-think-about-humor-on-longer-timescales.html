Topics help us think about humor on longer timescales 
</h1>
  
<p>
	We can also use topics to think about humor on a longer timescale than we usually do—like when we hear jokes, but don't feel humor until later:

	Elias doesn't feel much humor when he first hears the jokes. But the jokes were required for a <em>later</em> moment of humor. 
</p>
<p>
	So there's a relevant <term>short</term> timescale <callback>(something Elias observes, which is immediately followed by humor)</callback> and a relevant <term>long</term> timescale <callback>(what laid the groundwork for Elias' present humor)</callback>.
</p>
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We sometimes think of humor as something that happens primarily on a short timescale, like a few seconds—like someone tells us a joke, and then we laugh. But to fully understand humor, we also need to be able to think about longer timescale too, including days or weeks or even years.</p>
</div>

 <button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Agency and callibration</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">
		<p>When Elias was spoon-fed wordplay, he didn’t always have the situational flexibility to generate humor—like when just listened to a comedian, and didn't have the time or flexibility to balance his mistakes and OKs.</p>
	
	<p>However, when he was dynamically interacting with the world, Elias <term>did</term> have the flexibility to generate humor. This flexibility allowed him the agency to balance his evaluations, generating humor.</p>
	
<p>We experience this all the time. Watching a comedy in a movie theater can feel like a brittle experience—it's either funny or its not. If we're not feeling much humor in a movie theater, there's not much we can do about it—we're stuck there.</p>
	
<p>But when we watch a comedy at home with friends that's not funny, we have more agency—so we can adapt and generate humor no matter what. We do this by:</p>
		<ul>
			<li class="indepth">
				talking during dull parts
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				mocking characters
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				supplementing flat humor with our own commentary
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				exclaiming together
			</li>
			<li class="indepth">
				ordering pizza 
			</li>
            <li class="indepth">
				reading about the movie online 
			</li>
		</ul>
	
		<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
		
<p>This flexibility allows us to tailor humor out of our experience—and the same way we tailor humor out of a <em>movie</em>, flexibility lets us tailor humor out of <em>any</em> experience.</p>
