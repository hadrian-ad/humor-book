    <p><b>Fabrics.</b> “Woven fabrics” is an old metaphor for meaning, thinking, and words. The metaphor is still around today in a “text” book, which comes from the Latin word <i>textus</i>, literally <callback>"thing woven"</callback>&mdash;from texere <callback>“to weave, to join, fit together, braid, interweave,”</callback> and so on. The text of a book was what was woven together <callback>(with words)</callback>.</p>
     
    <p>The idea was that words in arrangement are more than their sum of their parts. If we randomize the text of a novel, it’ll have the same words, but no meaning. This is like any textile&mdash;if we randomize a knitted hat, it’ll have the same material, but no shape.</p> 
    
    <p>Our emotional <i>textus</i> is like this too&mdash;if we somehow randomized our experiences or evaluations, things wouldn’t really make sense. It’s the order and relation of our topics and evaluations that makes us us.</p></div>
