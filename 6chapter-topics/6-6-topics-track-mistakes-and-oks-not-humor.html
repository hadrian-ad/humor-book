Topics track mistakes and OKs, not humor
</h1>
  
<p>
	Topics track mistakes and OKs. These evaluations sometimes generate humor, but don't always. 
</p>
<p>
	Some of our topics may never generate humor at all—like how the topic ‘houseplant’ might never produce any humor our entire lives: 
</p>

    style="max-width:20rem;">


<p>
	But once we estimate the size of the mistake and OK on a topic, we have the information we need to try to generate humor from them.
</p>
<p>
	For instance, since ‘houseplant’ has a large OK, we could try using a large mistake to generate humor. We could: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li class="indepth">
		pretend it's a therapist and talk to it
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		focus on it to try to see it in new light
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		pretend our houseplant is a reincarnated white pine
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		give it a name like Augusta or Lord Grom
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		take many pictures of it wearing a scarf and share them with a friend
	</li>
</ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
<p>
	These would be larger mistakes that may match the large OK—and so generate humor.
</p>

<p>
 
	When we watch comedic movies, we sometimes feel humor in a way that seems to take no effort of our own. Things are a bit different with something like a houseplant—involving a houseplant in humor often takes effort and initiative.
</p>
<p>
	As we get better at generating humor on specific topics, we become more versatile at humor—and become more precise at emotional outcomes for different topics.

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    <p class="for-instance-text">Once we can generate humor from a houseplant, we can generate humor anywhere, on any topic. We're not limited to just "funny" topics in comedies—since <em>any</em> topic can have balanced mistakes and OKs on it.</p> 
       
    <p class="for-instance-text">It takes some practice and effective methodology to balance mistakes and OKs like this. But we <em>can</em> practice, <em>because</em> it's a skill—it's something we can improve at!</p>
