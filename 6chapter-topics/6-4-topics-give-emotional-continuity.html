Topics give emotional continuity 
</h1>

<p>
	We can use active and inactive topics to think about where humor comes from, and why:
</p>
<div class="vignette">
	<p>
	    <strong>A.</strong> <speaker>Carol:</speaker> <action>*points at bong*</action> <speech>“Zoe, what’s this?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Carol creates topic ‘Zoe’s object’)</notes>
	</p>
	<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*turns pink*</action> <narration>“Oh. It’s something Emma gave me.”</narration> </p>
	<p>
	    <speaker>Carol:</speaker> <narration>“That’s nice.”</narration> <notes>(&larr;no mistake&harr;no humor)</notes>
	</p>
<p class="vig-or-indent">- LATER -</p>

<p>
	Above, Carol has a topic that goes inactive from lack of attention. But then a chance observation reactivates this topic. 
</p>
<p>
	The same thing can happen by design, like when we're watching something that's intentionally trying to generate humor:
</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> <narration>Emma and Zoe are watching Fired Fireman 4: Moonshot.</narration> </p>
        <p>
        <narration>In the opening montage, Chief trains and then graduates from Space Fireman School. An adoring crowd cheers as he takes his diploma. As light bulbs flash, the scene switches to the graduation reception in the ballroom. One of Chief’s buddies tearfully hugs him and gives him an envelope and a congratulatory bong.</narration>
    </p>
    <p>
        <narration>Chief opens the envelope quizzically. It says <i>“RIP IT!”</i> </narration></p>
        <p><speech>“R.I.P.?”</speech> <narration>Chief says, confused, before he’s distracted by a firm handshake from the president of the United States and a passionate kiss from Victoria. The camera pans to the moon as the title comes in.</narration></p>
        <p>
            <narration>Emma and Zoe smile.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Emma and Zoe create topic of ‘Chief’s bong,’ which generates humor before going dormant)</notes>
        </p>
    <p class="or">- LATER -</p>
    <p><strong>B.</strong> <narration>Chief is unpacking on the moon base. He opens his luggage, and the bong rolls out. “Oh no! I brought the wrong suitcase!” he says aghast, picking up the bong right as the colonel walks in.</narration></p>
    <p><narration>Zoe and Emma laugh.</narration> <strong>(&larr;the topic of ‘Chief’s bong’ becomes active again, generating humor in Emma and Zoe before going dormant again)</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="or">- LATER -</p>
        <p>
        <strong>C.</strong> <narration>In the final fight, Chief is being choked to death by the cryogenically frozen Nazi they discovered on Mars and mistakenly thawed. Chief is about to give up, his life flashing before his eyes. Then out of the corner of his eye, Chief sees the bong! Emma and Zoe cheer and laugh. Chief grabs it and smashes it over the Nazi’s head, staggering him, and Chief hits the control panel to flush the Nazi out the airlock.</narration>
    </p>
    <p>
        <speech>“R.I.P. it,”</speech> <narration>Chief says, donning his fire helmet heroically as the Space Command Rescue arrives from Earth. Zoe and Emma are rolling on the sofa with laughter.</narration> <strong>(&larr;the topic of ‘Chief’s bong’ becomes active again, generating humor in and Emma and Zoe)</strong>
    </p>
</div>
<p>
	If we graph Emma or Zoe’s topic ‘Chief’s bong,’ the topic would be activated three times for three peaks of humor:
</p>

    <img

    title=""
    alt=""
    style="max-width:40rem;">

<p>
	Each scene is distinct, since the overall set of active topics is distinct. At the same time, each scene is partially related, since they share some of the same topics, like ‘Chief’ and ‘Chief’s bong.’
