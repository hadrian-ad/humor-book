Each active topic contributes to our emotional state 
</h1>
  
<p>When a topic is active, it generates emotions into our emotional state:</p>
<div class="vignette">

    <strong>
        A.
    </strong> <narration>Seventh grade Emma remembers her old teacher Ms. Gardener. She feels very calm, thinking about her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic 'Ms. Gardener' is active, generating <emotions-in-notes>calmness</emotions-in-notes> into Emma's emotional state)</notes>
