<p>
	The last few chapters, we've graphed our evaluations over time. However, these graphs didn't always have titles:
</p>

    <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-0-topics/6-0-0-graph-no-title.png"
    title="Our evaluation graphs haven't had labels"
    alt="This evaluation graph has a mistake and OK and a note that there's no title to this graph. This gives us no idea what these evaluations are of!"
    style="max-width:24rem; margin-top: .5rem">

<p>
	When we add a title to the graph, we know the topic of the evaluations we're graphing:
</p>
    <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-0-topics/6-0-1-graph-with-title.png"
    title="Introducing topics, which are labels"
    alt="This evaluation graph has a title 'stepping outside,' with a note saying how this title lets us know what the graphed evaluations are of."
    style="max-width:25rem; margin-top: .5rem;">


<p>
	In this book, we'll sometimes visualize topics as circles:
</p>

    <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/6c-images-topics/6-0-topics/6-0-2-graph-inside-topic.png"
    title="We'll visualize topics as circles"
    alt="This image shows a transformation of an evaluation graph. First, the graph is encircled with a smaller graph in it. Then this circle shrinks until the graph is removed, leaving just a small circle representing it. This circle is labeled the same as the evaluation graph."
    style="max-width:25rem; margin-top: .5rem">


<p>
	We'll use <vocab>topics</vocab> as a notational system to stay orderly when talking about our experiences&mdash;and to generate humor in precise ways.
</p>
<p>
	We'll be going over this throughout this chapter.
</p>
