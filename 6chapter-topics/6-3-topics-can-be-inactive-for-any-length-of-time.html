Topics can be inactive for any length of time 
</h1>

<p>
	Sometimes topics are inactive for a short time. But they can also be inactive for much longer&mdash;even decades:

    alt="A focus diagram shows the topic 'Ms. Gardner' being active at A and B, and inactive between, with an annotation noting the inactivity is for a decade. It connects to an evaluation graph showing mistakes and OKs, with those evaluations rapidly changing as the topic becomes active again."

<p>This all happens by the same process, no matter the scale of time. When our attention is on one of these topics, it's active&mdash;when it's not, it's inactive.</p>

    
    <div class="box">
<p><headline>Cycling through topics.</headline> As our attention changes, we rotate in new sets of active topics from our pool of inactive topics. This means that <term>some</term> of our topics are active, while <em>most</em> are inactive.</p>
    <p>
    Our ability to store evaluations on inactive topics&mdash;and then recall them when needed&mdash;allows us to do many things over time. For instance, we don't have to read a book in a single sitting&mdash;and then forget about the book we just read once we finish. 
				</p>
				<p>
    Instead, we can put a book down for a week, not give it any thought at all&mdash;and resume reading where we left off as soon as we pick it back up.</p> 
    
    <p>We can even think about books we read years and years ago, and experience the evaluatory effects of activating those topic. <callback>("What was your favorite series as a kid?")</callback>
