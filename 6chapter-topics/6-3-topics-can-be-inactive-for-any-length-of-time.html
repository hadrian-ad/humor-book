Topics can be inactive for any length of time 
</h1>

<p>
	Sometimes topics are inactive for just a short time. But they can also be inactive for much longer—even decades:

<p><strong>A.</strong> <narration>College Jennifer packs up her shared apartment as she graduates, putting her desk plushies into a box.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic ‘college mementos’ becomes inactive)</notes></p>
<p class="or">- LATER -</p>
<p><strong>B.</strong> <narration>Years later, Jennifer finds her old college mementos. She laughs as she takes them out and sets them on the windowsill.</narration> <notes>(&larr;topic ‘college mementos’ becomes active a decade later, generating humor)</notes></p>

<p>This all happens by the same process. When our attention is on one of these topics, it's active—when it's not, it's inactive. This is true whether a topic was inactive for ten seconds or for five years.</p>


 <button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Cycling through topics</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">
<p>As our attention changes, we rotate in new sets of active topics. This means that some of our topics are active, while most are inactive.</p>
    <p>
    Our ability to store evaluations on inactive topics—and then recall them when needed—allows us to do many things over time. For instance, we don't have to read a book in a single sitting—and then forget about the book we just read forever when we finish. 
				</p>
				<p>
    Instead, we can put a book down for a week, not give it any thought at all—and resume reading where we left off as soon as we pick it back up. We can even think about books we read years and years ago, and experience the evaluatory effects of activating those topic. <callback>("What was your favorite series as a kid?")</callback>
