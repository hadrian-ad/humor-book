The absence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>There’s often a surreal absence of humor tells in comedies. While <em>we</em> may laugh frequently, the <em>characters</em> often only laugh once or twice in the entire movie!</p>

<h2>surreal absence of humor in comedy</h2>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Jennifer and Sam re-watch Airplane!</p>
    
    <p>Tower: Flight 2-0-9er, you're cleared for take off.</p>
    
    <p>Clarence Oever: Roger!</p>
    
    <p>Roger Murdock: Huh?</p>
    
    <p>Tower: L.A. departure frequency 1-2-3 point 9er.</p>
    
    <p>Oever: Roger!</p>

    <p>John: Request Vector, over!</p>
    
    <p>Oever: What?</p>
    
    <p>Tower: Flight 2-0-9er clear for vector 2-3-4.</p>
    
    <p>Roger: We have clearance Clarence.</p>
    
    <p>Oever: Roger, Roger. What's our Vector Victor?</p>
    
    <p>Tower: Tower's radio clearance, over!</p>
    
    <p>Oever: *clarifying* That's Clarence Oever. Over!</p>
    
    <p>Tower: Roger.</p>
    
    <p>Roger: Huh?</p>
    
    <p>Tower: Roger, over.</p>
    
    <p>Roger: Huh?</p>
    
    <p>Oever: Huh?</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer and Sam are smiling throughout. It’s such a stupid scene!</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: “I love how straight everyone plays it in this movie!” (&larr;Jennifer notices a surreal absence of humor)</p>

<p>While humor tells are often surreally absent in comedies, they’re often surreally absent in every genre of spectator entertainment:</p> 

<h2>surreal absence of humor in porn</h2>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Sam and Jennifer are watching Busty Quarantine House IV.</p>
    
    <p>Actress: (stiffly) Do you like my drawing?” *holds up terrible sketch near her cleavage*</p>
    
    <p>Actor: (stiffly) “Lexi it’s nice but the college test is tomorrow. You need to focus.”</p>
    
    <p>Actress: *stiffly drops pencil* “Oops! I dropped my pencil.”</p>
    
    <p>Actor: (stiffly) “Well pick it up will ya? You have to study.”</p>
    
    <p>Actress: *crawls under table* *wriggling* “I can’t find it!”</p>
    
    <p>Actor: (stiffly) *sighs* “You’re so clumsy, Lexi.”</p>
    
    <p>Sam and Jennifer burst out laughing. Everyone in this one is so stoically serious all the time! (&larr;Sam and Jennifer notice a surreal absence of humor)</p>
    </div>

<h2>surreal absence of humor in mystery thrillers</h2>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Sam and Jennifer are watching the noir film Murder at Dusk.</p>  
    
    <p>Detective John Bruiser comes into his private eye office, shaking the rain from his hat. There’s a wrapped gift on his desk. He checks the tag: it’s from that Hollywood star he saved, Marie. He unwraps it. It’s the locket she was wearing. It has her number in it, and an elegantly scripted “yours.”</p>
    
    <p>He scowls deeper and lights a cigarette and leans back in his chair, blowing smoke into the air. He takes a swig from a bottle and starts cleaning his revolver.</p>
    
    <p>Jennifer: “He’s even moodier in the novels, too!”</p>
    
    <p>Sam: *smiles* “Is that possible?” (&larr;Sam and Jennifer notice a surreal absence of humor)</p> 
    </div>
<h2>surreal absence of humor in action films</h2>
<div class="vignette">
    <p>Emma and Owen are watching a campy action film.</p>
    
    <p>The Necromongers demand the populace bow down to them. Everyone does—except for Riddick.</p>
    
    <p>Necromonger soldier: (grimly) “This is your one chance. Take the Lord Marshall’s offer, and bowwww.”</p>
    
    <p>Riddick: (grimly) “I bow to no man.”</p>
    
    <p>Necromonger: *removes helmet* (grimly) “He’s not a man. He’s a holy half-dead who has seen the underverse.”</p>
    
    <p>Owen: “God, I love how straight the dialogue in this movie is played!”</p>
    
    <p>Riddick spins a blade in his hand to evaluate it.</p>
    
    <p>Emma: *quoting the next line* (grimly) “It’s a half-gram heavy on the back.”</p>
    
    <p>Riddick: (grimly) “It’s a half-gram heavy on the back.”</p>
    
    <p>Owen and Emma laugh. (&larr;Owen and Emma notice a surreal absence of humor)</p>

<p>Once it's pointed out, it's obvious that the absence of humor tells can be surreal. As before, there's nothing wrong with this—it's just not a straightforward reflection of our own lives.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Which character in the clip above shows humor tells? (The Lord Marshall.) Sometimes, we're not used to registering these humor tells in spectator entertainment—we can't describe who smiles in a scene. But with practice, these humor tells start standing out to us.</p>
    
<p class="considertext">These humor tells (or their absence) provide information about the characters' evaluations. Riddick has such a large OK that no mistake could possibly make him laugh or feel fear. The Lord Marshall also has a large OK, and so the smile indicates the unusually large mistake. We can characterize his low-intensity humor as light <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Coherent surrealness</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

    As before, spectator entertainment can be <em>surreal</em> while still being emotionally <em>coherent</em>. If a movie shows that a character can jump twenty feet, this premise is surreal—but the movie can still be coherent to that premise.
    
    In the same way, if a movie shows that a grim character never expresses humor tells, this emotional premise can be surreal—but the movie can still be coherent to that premise.
