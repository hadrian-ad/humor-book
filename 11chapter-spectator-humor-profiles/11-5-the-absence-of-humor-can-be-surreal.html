The absence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>There’s often a surreal <term>absence</term> of humor tells in comedies. While <em>we</em> may laugh frequently, the <em>characters</em> often only laugh once or twice in the entire movie!</p>

    <p>Once it's pointed out, it's obvious that the <term>absence</term> of humor tells can be surreal. As before, there's nothing wrong with this—instead, the point is just that humor in spectator entertainment isn't a straightforwardly reflection of the humor in our own lives.</p>

   <p>(Excercise: who in this scene shows humor tells? Answer in the tab.)</p>
   
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ilG8mzbHNNI?start=18&amp;end=148" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>

  <div class="content-example">

  <p>In the clip above, which character shows humor tells? The Lord Marshall.</p>
  
    <p>Sometimes we're not used to registering low-intensity humor tells in spectator entertainment, like the Lord Marshall's. It's not a "funny" scene, we tend to overlook humor tells in villains, and the characters <i>feeling</i> humor aren't usually the ones making <em>us</em> feel humor.</p>
  
  <p>But these humor tells (or their absence) provide information about the characters' evaluations. Riddick has such a large OK that no mistake could possibly make him laugh or feel fear. The <i>Lord Marshall</i> also has a large OK, which means his smile indicates an unusually large mistake to him.</p> 
  
<p>We can characterize The Lord Marshall's low-intensity humor as light <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> (to the situation), and so on.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Coherent surrealness</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

   <p>As before, spectator entertainment can be emotionally <em>surreal</em> while still being emotionally <em>coherent</em>. If a movie shows that a character can jump twenty feet, this premise is surreal—but the movie can still be coherent to that premise.</p>
    
    <p>In the same way, if a movie shows that a grim character never expresses humor tells, this emotional premise can be surreal—but the movie can still be coherent to that premise.</p>
    
    <p>As a general rule of thumb, we tend to find emotionally <em>incoherence</em> more objectionable than emotionally surrealness.</p>
