The absence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


There’s often a surreal absence of humor tells in comedies. While we may laugh frequently, the characters often only laugh once or twice in the entire movie!

surreal absence of humor in comedy

Jennifer and Sam re-watch Airplane!

Tower : Flight 2-0-9er, you're cleared for take off.

Clarence Oever: Roger!

Roger Murdock: Huh?

Tower: L.A. departure frequency 1-2-3 point 9er.

Oever: Roger!

Roger: Huh?!

John: Request Vector, over!

Oever: What?

Tower: Flight 2-0-9er clear for vector 2-3-4.

Roger: We have clearance Clarence.

Oever: Roger, Roger. What's our Vector Victor?

Tower: Tower's radio clearance, over!

Oever: *clarifying* That's Clarence Oever. Over!

Tower : Roger.

Roger: Huh?

Tower: Roger, over.

Roger: Huh?

Oever: Huh?

Jennifer and Sam are smiling throughout. It’s such a stupid scene!

Jennifer: “I love how straight everyone plays it in this movie!” (&larr;Jennifer notices a surreal absence of humor)





While humor tells are often surreally absent in comedies, they’re often surreally absent in every genre of spectator entertainment: 

surreal absence of humor in porn

Sam and Jennifer are watching Busty Quarantine House IV.

Actress: (stiffly) Do you like my drawing?” *holds up terrible sketch near her cleavage*

Actor: (stiffly) “Lexi it’s nice but the college test is tomorrow. You need to focus.”

Actress: *stiffly drops pencil* “Oops! I dropped my pencil.”

Actor: (stiffly) “Well pick it up will ya? You have to study.”

Actress: *crawls under table* *wriggling* “I can’t find it!”

Actor: (stiffly) *sighs* “You’re so clumsy, Lexi.”

Sam and Jennifer burst out laughing. Everyone in this one is so stoically serious all the time! (&larr;Sam and Jennifer notice a surreal absence of humor)

surreal absence of humor in mystery thrillers

Sam and Jennifer are watching the noir film Murder at Dusk.  

Detective John Bruiser comes into his private eye office, shaking the rain from his hat. There’s a wrapped gift on his desk. He checks the tag: it’s from that Hollywood star he saved, Marie. He unwraps it. It’s the locket she was wearing. It has her number in it, and an elegantly scripted “yours.”

He scowls deeper and lights a cigarette and leans back in his chair, blowing smoke into the air. He takes a swig from a bottle and starts cleaning his revolver.

Jennifer: “He’s even moodier in the novels, too!”

Sam: *smiles* “Is that possible?” (&larr;Sam and Jennifer notice a surreal absence of humor) 

surreal absence of humor in action films

Emma and Owen are watching a campy action film.

The Necromongers demand the populace bow down to them. Everyone does—except for Riddick.

Necromonger soldier: (grimly) “This is your one chance. Take the Lord Marshall’s offer, and bowwww.”

Riddick: (grimly) “I bow to no man.”

Necromonger: *removes helmet* (grimly) “He’s not a man. He’s a holy half-dead who has seen the underverse.”

Owen: “God, I love how straight the dialogue in this movie is played!”

Riddick spins a blade in his hand to evaluate it.

Emma: *quoting the next line* (grimly) “It’s a half-gram heavy on the back.”

Riddick: (grimly) “It’s a half-gram heavy on the back.”

Owen and Emma laugh. (&larr;Owen and Emma notice a surreal absence of humor)

 





Once it's pointed out, it's obvious that the absence of humor tells can be surreal. As before, there's nothing wrong with this—it's just not a straightforward reflection of our own lives.

> Consider:

Which character in the clip above shows humor tells? (The Lord Marshall.) Sometimes, we're not used to registering these humor tells in spectator entertainment—we can't describe who smiles in a scene. But with practice, these humor tells start standing out to us.



These humor tells (or their absence) provide information about the characters' evaluations. Riddick has such a large OK that no mistake could possibly make him laugh or feel fear. The Lord Marshall also has a large OK, and so the smile indicates the unusually large mistake. We can characterize his low-intensity humor as light realization, insight, connection, reconciliation, and so on.

    Coherence. As before, spectator entertainment can be surreal while still being emotionally coherent. If a movie shows that a character can jump twenty feet, this premise is surreal—but the movie can still be coherent to that premise.
    
In the same way, if Chronicles of Riddick shows that Riddick never expresses humor tells, this emotional premise can be surreal—but the movie can still be coherent to that premise.
