The absence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>There’s often a surreal <sem>absence</sem> of humor tells in comedies. While <term>we</term> may laugh frequently, the <em>characters</em> often only laugh once or twice in the entire movie!</p>

    <p>Once it's pointed out, it's obvious that the both the presence <sem>and</sem> absence of humor tells can be surreal.</p>
    
     <p>As before, there's nothing wrong with this—instead, the point is just that humor in spectator entertainment isn't straightforwardly a reflection of the humor in our own lives.</p>

   <p>(<sem>Excercise</sem>: who in this scene shows humor tells? Answer in the excercise tab below.)</p>

  <p>In the clip above, which character shows humor tells? It's the Lord Marshall.</p>
  
    <p>For many of us, these humor tells aren't obvious to us without being prompted to look for them. It's not a "funny" scene, and we tend to overlook humor tells in antagonists, and the characters <term>feeling</term> humor aren't usually the ones making <em>us</em> feel humor.</p>
  
  <p>But the presence of these humor tells (or their absence) provide information about the characters' evaluations:</p> 
  
  <ul>
     <li>Riddick has such a large OK that no mistake could possibly make him laugh or feel fear.</li> 
      
      <li>The Lord Marshall either has a smaller OK than he should in the circumstance <callback>(he feels risk of negative personal consequences)</callback>, or else has a large OK that indicates an unusually large mistake to him.</li>
      </ul> 
  
<p>We can characterize The Lord Marshall's low-intensity humor as light <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> (to the situation), and so on. Riddick, aloof and unconcerned, feels much less <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions> (to the situation), and so on.</p>

   <p><headline>Coherent surrealness.</headline> As before, spectator entertainment can be emotionally <term>surreal</term> while still being emotionally <em>coherent</em>. If a movie shows that a character can jump twenty feet, this premise is surreal—but the movie can still be coherent to that premise.</p>
    
    <p>In the same way, if a movie shows that a grim character never expresses humor tells, this emotional premise can be surreal—but the movie can still be coherent to that premise.</p>
    
    <p>As a general rule of thumb, we tend to find emotionally <term>incoherence</term> <callback>(inconsistency to the premises)</callback> more objectionable than emotionally <em>surrealness</em> <callback>(the premises themselves)</callback>.</p>
