Spectator humor profiles vary by medium
</h1>

<p>Different kinds of spectator entertainment have different constraints in how humor can be presented. So they develop medium-specific spectator humor profiles to make the best of the constraints:</p>

<ul>
       <li>If we’re producing a <sem>play</sem>, we want someone in the back row to clearly perceive an actor’s humor—so we'll avoid subtle physical humor tells.</li>
       
        <li>If we’re making a <sem>graphic novel</sem>, we need to show the intensity of humor in a single panel without sound—so we'll use fonts and marks as humor tells.</li>
        
        <li>If we’re writing a <sem>book</sem>, we need to use quick and generic cues to keep a brisk pace of written conversation—so we'll use shorthands like <i>"he laughed."</i></li>
        
        <li>If we’re filming a fast-paced <sem>movie</sem>, we'll want the audience to be able to be able to read emotion states in a split second—and so we'll use musical cues and exaggerated facial expressions as humor tells.</li>
        </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>


<!--
<p>Spectator entertainment sometimes <em>has</em> to use surreal humor tells:</p>

<ul>
   <li>A graphic novel <em>can’t</em> have a real humor profile, because it’s a graphic novel—the creators have only a single frame to try to convey someone’s humor tells</li>
    <li>An animated movie <em>can’t</em> have a real humor profile, because it’s animated—plus, there’s no reason to animate dimples or other humor tells if it doesn’t fit the style</li>
    <li>Plays <em>can’t</em> have scenes with lots of genuine-seeming laughter, because <em>actors</em> can't imitate convincing intense laughter on command.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    -->
    

<p>Once we get used to spectator humor profiles, they don't seems surreal—like how reading a novel seems completely normal to us:</p>

<div class="vignette">
 <p><narration>Zoe is reading The Horsetrainer and the Duke. The haughty, broad-shouldered duke touches his chin with pride.</narration>
    </p> 
<p><speech>Duke:</speech> <internalaction>(pridefully)</internalaction> “Do you think me clever, Samantha?”</p>
    
    <p><speech>Samantha:</speech> <action>*eyes dancing*</action> <action>*laughing*</action> <notes>(&larr;Samantha has spectator humor profile)</notes> “No, I think you a fool, m'lord.”</p> 
    <p><speech>Duke:</speech> <action>*raises eyebrow*</action> <action>*light smile plays upon his lips*</action> <notes>(&larr;the Duke has a spectator humor profile)</notes> <speech>"Is that so? Then perhaps you'll be suprised to hear that I've known all along about what you've been hiding in the stables. And here you've so long pretended to have never done me a good deed."</speech></p>
    <p><narration>Samantha is briefly speechless from surprise, and the duke laughs at her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the Duke has a spectator humor profile to us)</notes></p>
    
<p>
    <narration>Zoe devours the novel.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Spectator humor profiles in novels seem unmentionably normal to Zoe)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
    
        <div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Zoe is reading Gone with the Wind</narration></p>

<p class="bookquote">"Eavesdroppers--" Scarlett began furiously.</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Eavesdroppers often hear highly entertaining and instructive things," Rhett grinned. <notes>(&larr;novel has spectator humor profile)</notes> "From a long experience in eavesdropping, I--"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Sir," she said, "you are no gentleman!"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"An apt observation," he answered airily.  "And, you, Miss, are no lady."  He seemed to find her very amusing, for he laughed softly again. <notes>(&larr;novel has spectator humor profile)</notes></p>

<p><narration>Zoe smiles as she reads. She loves the scenes with Rhett. They're just fun.</narration> <notes>(&larr;spectator humor profiles in novels seem unmentionably normal to Zoe)</notes></p>
    </div>    
 

    
<p>We don’t usually notice that these spectator humor profiles are artificial or surreal until we have to acclimate to <em>new</em> genres. n


<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we’ve never read any manga or watched any anime, it'll take us a while for their spectator humor profiles to stop seeming artificial or stilted:</p>
    
    
        <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-1-spectator-humor-profiles-vary-by-medum/11-1-0-hatches.png"
    
    title=""
    alt=""
    style="max-width: 29rem ; margin-left:2rem "
    >
    
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">For a while, emotions in manga would strike us as annoying, distracting, simplistic, unrelatable, weird, and so on. But this is how all spectator entertainment feels at first.</p>
</div>

<p>Once we acclimate to different spectator humor profiles, they becomes unnoticeably normal—and the spectator humor profile does what it’s supposed to do, which is to efficiently convey information about the character’s evaluations. </p>

<p>At that point, we roll everything together as part of the experience, and nothing in particular stands out to us as unusual—we read a novel, watch a movie, enjoy a graphic novel, and don't register that the way they depict humor is an abstract representation.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Novels use concise, conventional descriptions <callback>(*eyes dancing*)</callback> to keep the pace of reading brisk—while avoiding purposeless attempts at greater realism for realism’s sake.</p>
        
    </div>


<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Why do spectator humor profiles exist?</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

   <p>There are a few reason spectator humor profiles exist:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most actors can’t convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command. We can watch a video of ourselves doubled over with laughter, and then try to do this perfectly on command—we can't, and actors can't either!</li>
    
    <li>Laughing takes a long time! Having a realistic amount of it in a movie would mess with pacing—unless spectator entertainment has a good reason for 10% of the runtime be characetrs laughing, they probably won't. </li>

   <!--
    <button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Video example</button>
    
    <div class="content-example">
    
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/si7-GBpm1vU?si=na9oDKeH7bRVebC8&amp;start=72&amp;end=96;" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    <p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The climactic scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds long—10% of the scene!</p>
    
    <p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively common in our day-to-day lives, they're not in this show—because the show has no reason to have realistic duration humor just for realism's sake.</p>
    
    <p>This particular scene is distinctive not just for it's long laugh, but for sounding more like a real laugh at the end. The voice actor moves into a higher pitch of laughter at the end, with some audio distortion as if the actor is laughing in a way that moves him away from the mic.</p>
    
    
    
    </div>
    -->
    <li>Our face changes when we give genuine smiles—our skin crinkles, our lips rise toward our nose, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on. Some movies make a choice to subordinate realism for a stylistic effect—like how many movies have a style of cinematography and editing that rarely lets actors or characters blink, let along squint their eyes when they smile.</li>
    


    <li>But some kinds of spectator entertainment, an intense smile can strike us as unusual or come off as unappealing. In this case, what feels good in our lives doesn't feel as good on a screen.</li> 
    </ul>
    
    
<div class="for-instance">    
            <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
             
             <p class="for-instance-text">If we were talking to the actor below at a bus stop, we'd prefer he smile like he is on the right—since then we'd both be feeling <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>.</p> 
             
             <p class="for-instance-text">But when we’re simply looking at a still picture, the broad smile looks a bit odd. We don't currently think characters should smile broadly in movies like this:</p>
        
            <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-0-spectator-humor-profiles/11-0-3-han-solo-2.png"
        
        title=""
        alt=""
        style="max-width: ; margin-left: "
        >
        
        </div>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>All of these can lead to spectator humor profiles—like how movie characters won't smile or laugh intensely for various reasons, supported both by the script and the directing.</p>

<p>For most movies, emotional realism isn't the goal. Instead, the goal is the emotional handling of the <em>audience</em>—not realism for realism's sake. This includes how actors use humor tells.</p> 


   
    </div>
    


<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Video and text example:</button>
            
    <div class="content-example">


<p>We don't usually notice conventions in novels as artificial or stilted, because we're so used to them.</p>

<p>For instance, we probably didn't bat an eye at Rhett "laughing softly" in the passage from <i>Gone With the Wind</i>—it's so normal it's hard to think about</p> 

<p>But just because it's normal doesn't mean it's realistic. We can see this by noticing how undefined that is—we could imagine a thousand different acted scenes with a thousand different interpretations of Rhett "laughing softly."</p>

<p>We can see on actor's interpretation below:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrhNPS4nbmQ?si=PU1bpfmIPD1xRTKC&amp;start=77&amp;end=132" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>At first glance, we may not notice that the actor is using a spectator humor profile. But he is! On a general level, if we had two comparative videos—this video of acted humor and another video of felt humor—no one would pick this scene as the more "realistic" humor.</p> 

<p>On a more specific level, we can notice how the actor is supporting the needs of the medium—like how we walks to stand close enough to the other actor so that both are in frame. He also speaks in measured, complete sentences—all things that are done to support the conventions and limitations of films of this time period, not mirror reality.</p>
    

 <p>The point of all this isn't to take away from spectator entertainment. Instead, the point is just to recognize how depictions of humor in spectator entertainment are different than how humor is experienced and expressed in our own interpersonal lives.

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Text from the novel:</button>

<div class="content-example">

<p>"Sir, you should have made known your presence."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"  His white teeth gleamed and his bold dark eyes laughed at her.  "But you were the intruder.  I was forced to wait for Mr. Kennedy, and feeling that I was perhaps persona non grata in the back yard, I was thoughtful enough to remove my unwelcome presence here where I thought I would be undisturbed.  But, alas!" he shrugged and laughed softly.</p>

<p>Her temper was beginning to rise again at the thought that this rude and impertinent man had heard everything--heard things she now wished she had died before she ever uttered.</p>

<p>"Eavesdroppers--" she began furiously. "Eavesdroppers often hear highly entertaining and instructive things," he grinned.  "From a long experience in eavesdropping, I--"</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, "you are no gentleman!"</p>

<p>"An apt observation," he answered airily.  "And, you, Miss, are no lady."  He seemed to find her very amusing, for he laughed softly again.  "No one can remain a lady after saying and doing what have just overheard.  However, ladies have seldom held any charms for me.  I know what they are thinking, but they never have the courage or lack of breeding to say what they think.  And that, in
    time, becomes a bore.  But you, my dear Miss O'Hara, are a girl of rare spirit, very admirable spirit, and I take off my hat to you. I fail to understand what charms the elegant Mr. Wilkes can hold
    for a girl of your tempestuous nature.  He should thank God on bended knee for a girl with your--how did he put it?--'passion for living,' but being a poor-spirited wretch--"</p>

<p>"You aren't fit to wipe his boots!" she shouted in rage.</p>

<p>"And you were going to hate him all your life!"  He sank down on the sofa and she heard him laughing.</p>
