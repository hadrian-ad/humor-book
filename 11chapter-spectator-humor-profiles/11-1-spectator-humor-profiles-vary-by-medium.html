Spectator humor profiles vary by medium
</h1>

<p>Different kinds of spectator entertainment have different constraints in how humor can be presented. So they develop spectator humor profiles to make the best of those constraints:</p>

<ul>
       <li>If we’re producing a <sem>play</sem>, we want someone in the back row to clearly perceive an actor’s humor—so we'll avoid subtle physical humor tells.</li>
       
        <li>If we’re making a <sem>graphic novel</sem>, we need to show the intensity of humor in a single panel without sound—so we'll use fonts and marks as humor tells.</li>
        
        <li>If we’re writing a <sem>book</sem>, we need to use quick and generic cues to keep a brisk pace of written conversation—so we'll use shorthands like <i>"he laughed."</i></li>
        
        <li>If we’re filming a fast-paced <sem>movie</sem>, we'll want the audience to be able to be able to read emotion states in a split second—and so we'll use musical cues and exaggerated facial expressions as humor tells.</li>
        </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>


<!--
<p>Spectator entertainment sometimes <em>has</em> to use surreal humor tells:</p>

<ul>
   <li>A graphic novel <em>can’t</em> have a real humor profile, because it’s a graphic novel—the creators have only a single frame to try to convey someone’s humor tells</li>
    <li>An animated movie <em>can’t</em> have a real humor profile, because it’s animated—plus, there’s no reason to animate dimples or other humor tells if it doesn’t fit the style</li>
    <li>Plays <em>can’t</em> have scenes with lots of genuine-seeming laughter, because <em>actors</em> can't imitate convincing intense laughter on command.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    -->
    

<p>Once we get used to spectator humor profiles, they don't seems surreal—like how the humor in a novel seems completely normal to us:</p>

<div class="vignette">
 <p><narration>Zoe is reading The Horsetrainer and the Duke.</narration></p> 
   
   <p><narration>The haughty, broad-shouldered duke touched his chin with pride as he looks over his manor.</narration> <speech>"Do you think me clever, Samantha?"</speech> <speech>he asked.</speech></p>
   
    <p><narration>Samantha laughed.</narration> <speech>"No, m'lord,"</speech> <narration>she says, eyes dancing,</narration> <speech>"I think you a fool!"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Samantha has a spectator humor profile)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>A light smile plays upon the duke's lips as he turns to look at her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the Duke has a spectator humor profile)</notes></p> <p><speech>"Is that so?"</speech><narration>he asks, eyebrow raising.</narration> <speech>"Then perhaps you'll be suprised to hear that I've known all along about what you've been hiding in the stables. And here you've so long pretended to have never done me a good deed!"</speech> </p>
   
   <p><narration>Samantha is briefly speechless from surprise. How could he have known? The duke laughs at her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the Duke has a spectator humor profile)</notes></p>    
<p>
    <narration>Zoe devours the novel.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Spectator humor profiles in novels seem unmentionably normal to Zoe)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
    
        <div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Zoe is reading Gone with the Wind</narration></p>

<p class="bookquote">"Eavesdroppers--" Scarlett began furiously.</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Eavesdroppers often hear highly entertaining and instructive things," Rhett grinned. <notes>(&larr;novel has spectator humor profile)</notes> "From a long experience in eavesdropping, I--"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Sir," she said, "you are no gentleman!"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"An apt observation," he answered airily.  "And, you, Miss, are no lady."  He seemed to find her very amusing, for he laughed softly again. <notes>(&larr;novel has spectator humor profile)</notes></p>

<p><narration>Zoe smiles as she reads. She loves the scenes with Rhett. They're just fun.</narration> <notes>(&larr;spectator humor profiles in novels seem unmentionably normal to Zoe)</notes></p>
    </div>    
 

    
    <p>We often get so familiar to these spectator humor profiles that they seem normal&mdash;but being familiar isn't the same thing as being realistic.</p>


<p>It's often not until we have to acclimate to <sem>new</sem> genres that we realize how artificial spectator humor profiles are.</p> 


<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">
    
    If we’ve never read any manga or watched any anime, it'll take us a while for their spectator humor profiles to stop seeming artificial or stilted:</p>
    
    
        <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-1-spectator-humor-profiles-vary-by-medum/11-1-0-hatches.png"
    
    title=""
    alt=""
    style="max-width: 29rem ; margin-left:2rem "
    >
    
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">For a while, emotions in manga would strike us as annoying, distracting, simplistic, unrelatable, weird, and so on. But this is how all spectator entertainment feels at first—from novels to plays to radio performances.</p>
</div>

<p>Once we acclimate to different spectator humor profiles, they become unnoticeably normal—and the spectator humor profile does what it’s supposed to do, which is to efficiently convey information about the character’s evaluations. </p>

<p>At that point, we roll everything together as part of the experience, and nothing in particular stands out to us as unusual—we read a novel, watch a movie, enjoy a graphic novel, and don't register that the way they depict humor is an abstract representation with just loose accuracy to actual human behavior. <callback>(*eyes dancing*)</callback></p>
      

    


<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Case study (Gone with the Wind)</button>
            
    <div class="content-example">


<p>We probably didn't bat an eye when Rhett was <callback>"laughing softly"</callback> in the passage from <i>Gone With the Wind</i>—it's so normal and familiar it's hard to notice!</p>

<p>But just because it's familiar doesn't mean it's realistic. In this case, <callback>"laughing softly"</callback> is so vague as to not really describe anything at all.
    
 <div class="consider">
          <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">If a book describes a city street as "bustling," we wouldn't declare this the same thing as actually being on the street ourselves. It's a pretty vague description. Descriptions of humor are similar.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext"><callback>"Bustling"</callback> can describe thousands of very different streets, just like <callback>"laughing softly"</callback> can describe millions of different laughs.</p> 
        </div>

<p>We can see on actor's interpretation of this passage below:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrhNPS4nbmQ?si=PU1bpfmIPD1xRTKC&amp;start=77&amp;end=132" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>At first glance, we may not notice that the actor is using a spectator humor profile. But he is!</p> 

<p>It's not a coincidence that the actor is supporting the needs of the medium—he walks to stand close enough to the other actor so that both are in frame, and speaks in measured, complete sentences. These are done to support the conventions and limitations of films from this time period—not to mirror reality.</p>

<p>And as a broader point, if we had two clips&mdash;one of Rhett laughing and another someone laughing spontaneously&mdash;no one would confuse Rhett's spectator humor profile as being the more realistic one.</p>

 <p>The point of all this isn't to take away from spectator entertainment. Instead, the point is just to recognize how depictions of humor in spectator entertainment are different than how humor is experienced and expressed in our own interpersonal lives.

<div class="content-example">

<p class="bookquote">"Sir, you should have made known your presence."</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Indeed?"  His white teeth gleamed and his bold dark eyes laughed at her.  "But you were the intruder.  I was forced to wait for Mr. Kennedy, and feeling that I was perhaps persona non grata in the back yard, I was thoughtful enough to remove my unwelcome presence here where I thought I would be undisturbed.  But, alas!" he shrugged and laughed softly.</p>

<p class="bookquote">Her temper was beginning to rise again at the thought that this rude and impertinent man had heard everything--heard things she now wished she had died before she ever uttered.</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Eavesdroppers--" she began furiously. "Eavesdroppers often hear highly entertaining and instructive things," he grinned.  "From a long experience in eavesdropping, I--"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Sir," she said, "you are no gentleman!"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"An apt observation," he answered airily.  "And, you, Miss, are no lady."  He seemed to find her very amusing, for he laughed softly again.  "No one can remain a lady after saying and doing what have just overheard.  However, ladies have seldom held any charms for me.  I know what they are thinking, but they never have the courage or lack of breeding to say what they think.  And that, in
    time, becomes a bore.  But you, my dear Miss O'Hara, are a girl of rare spirit, very admirable spirit, and I take off my hat to you. I fail to understand what charms the elegant Mr. Wilkes can hold
    for a girl of your tempestuous nature.  He should thank God on bended knee for a girl with your--how did he put it?--'passion for living,' but being a poor-spirited wretch--"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"You aren't fit to wipe his boots!" she shouted in rage.</p>

<p class="bookquote">"And you were going to hate him all your life!"  He sank down on the sofa and she heard him laughing.</p>
