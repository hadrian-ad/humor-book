Spectator humor profiles vary by medium
</h1>

Spectator entertainment sometimes has to use surreal humor tells:

A graphic novel can’t have a real humor profile, because it’s a graphic novel—the creators have only a single frame to try to convey someone’s humor tells
An animated movie can’t have a real humor profile, because it’s animated—there’s no reason to animate dimples if it doesn’t fit the style
Most actors can’t light their face up on command—they can’t voluntarily imitate every involuntary action needed to convincingly portray humor 
To get around this, each medium or style creates its own spectator humor profile. These will have to solve specific problems related to that spectator entertainment: 

If we’re producing a play, we want someone in the back row to clearly perceive an actor’s humor
If we’re making a graphic novel, we need to show the intensity of humor in a single panel
If we’re writing a book, we need to use quick and generic cues to keep a brisk pace of written conversation
If we’re filming a movie, we need the audience to be able to unambiguously read the emotional states of a minor character that only has 30 seconds of screen time
(and so on) 

Once we get used to a medium or style’s spectator humor profile, it doesn't seems surreal—it seems completely normal to us:



Zoe is reading The Horsetrainer and the Duke.

The haughty, broad-shouldered duke touched his dark beard with pride. “Do you think me clever, Samantha?”

“I think you a fool,” she said, laughing. (&larr;Samantha has a spectator humor profile, which is particular to novels) 

"Is that so," the duke said, eyes dancing. (&larr;Duke has a spectator humor profile, which is particular to novels) "Then perhaps you will be surprised by what I've deduced about you."

Samantha's raised her eyebrows, a light smile on her lips. (&larr;Samantha has a spectator humor profile, which is particular to novels) "Why, milord, what might that be?" 

Most characters in novels have the same spectator humor profiles. They all characters concisely "laugh" in the same generic way. We're probably so used to this that we don't even notice it.

> Consider:
By using concise, familiar emotional cues (“eyes dancing”), novels keep the pace of reading brisk—while avoiding purposeless attempts at greater realism for realism’s sake. 
We don’t usually notice that these spectator humor profiles are artificial or surreal until we come across a new medium or a new style. 

For instance, if we’ve never read any manga or watched any anime, it may take us a while before we’d acclimate to how emotions are expressed, including humor:

For a while, a “manga humor profile” would strike us as annoying, distracting, simplistic, unrelatable, weird, and so on. But once we acclimate to it, it becomes unnoticeably normal—and it does what it’s supposed to do, which is to efficiently convey information about the character’s evaluations. 

At that point, we’d be rolling everything together as part of the experience, and nothing in particular stands out to us as unusual.
