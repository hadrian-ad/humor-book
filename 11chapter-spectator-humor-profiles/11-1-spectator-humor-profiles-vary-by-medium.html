Spectator humor profiles vary by medium
</h1>

<p><term>Spectator humor profiles</term> are used to solve problems with different kinds of spectator entertainment.</p>

<ul>
       <li>If we’re producing a play, we want someone in the back row to clearly perceive an actor’s humor—so we'll avoid subtle humor tells.</li>
       
        <li>If we’re making a graphic novel, we need to show the intensity of humor in a single panel without sound—so we'll use fonts and marks as humor tells.</li>
        
        <li>If we’re writing a book, we need to use quick and generic cues to keep a brisk pace of written conversation—so we'll use shorthands like <i>"he laughed."</i></li>
        
        <li>If we’re filming a movie, we need the audience to be able to unambiguously read the emotional states of sometimes fast-paced scenes—and so we'll use musical cues as humor tells, along with exaggerated facial expressions that can be read in split seconds.</li>
        </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>


<!--
<p>Spectator entertainment sometimes <em>has</em> to use surreal humor tells:</p>

<ul>
   <li>A graphic novel <em>can’t</em> have a real humor profile, because it’s a graphic novel—the creators have only a single frame to try to convey someone’s humor tells</li>
    <li>An animated movie <em>can’t</em> have a real humor profile, because it’s animated—plus, there’s no reason to animate dimples or other humor tells if it doesn’t fit the style</li>
    <li>Plays <em>can’t</em> have scenes with lots of genuine-seeming laughter, because <em>actors</em> can't imitate convincing intense laughter on command.</li>
    </ul> 
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    -->
    
<p>All of these lead to surreal humor tells for each style or medium, leading to distinctive spectator humor profiles.</p>


<p>Once we get used to spectator humor profiles, they don't seems surreal—they seems completely normal to us, like how we feel reading novels:</p>

<div class="vignette">
 <p><narration>Zoe is reading The Horsetrainer and the Duke. The haughty, broad-shouldered duke touches his chin with pride.</narration>
    </p> 
<p><speech>Duke:</speech> “Do you think me clever, Samantha?”</p>
    
    <p><speech>Samantha:</speech> <action>*eyes dancing*</action> <action>*laughing*</action> <notes>(&larr;Samantha has spectator humor profile)</notes> “I think you a fool, m'lord.”</p> 
    <p><speech>Duke:</speech> <action>*raises eyebrow*</action> <action>*light smile plays upon his lips*</action> <notes>(&larr;the Duke has a spectator humor profile)</notes> <speech>"Is that so? Then perhaps you'll be suprised to hear that I've known all along about what you've been hiding in the stables. And here you've so long pretended to have never done me a good deed."</speech></p>
    <p><narration>Samantha is briefly speechless from surprise, and the duke laughs at her.</narration> <notes>(&larr;the Duke has a spectator humor profile to us)</notes></p>
    
<p>
    <narration>Zoe is enjoying this series. Surprisingly good twists all the way through.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Spectator humor profiles in novels seem unmentinoably normal to Zoe)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
    
        <div class="vignette">
<p><narration>Zoe is reading Gone with the Wind</narration></p>

<p class="bookquote">"Eavesdroppers--" Scarlett began furiously.</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Eavesdroppers often hear highly entertaining and instructive things," Rhett grinned. <notes>(&larr;novel has spectator humor profile)</notes> "From a long experience in eavesdropping, I--"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"Sir," she said, "you are no gentleman!"</p>

<p class="bookquote">"An apt observation," he answered airily.  "And, you, Miss, are no lady."  He seemed to find her very amusing, for he laughed softly again. <notes>(&larr;novel has spectator humor profile)</notes></p>

<p><narration>Zoe smiles as she reads. She loves the scenes with Rhett. They're just fun.</narration> <notes>(&larr;spectator humor profiles in novels seem unmentionably normal to Zoe)</notes></p>
    </div>    
 
<p>Most characters in novels have similar spectator humor profiles. Everyone concisely and abstractly <action>"laughs"</action> in the same generic way—which is mainly used just in novels.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Novels use concise, conventional descriptions <callback>(*eyes dancing*)</callback> to keep the pace of reading brisk—while avoiding purposeless attempts at greater realism for realism’s sake.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>We don’t usually notice that these spectator humor profiles are artificial or surreal until we have to acclimate to <em>new</em> genres. If we’ve never read any manga or watched any anime, it'll take us a while for their spectator humor profiles to stop seeming artificial or stilted:</p>

<p>For a while, emotions in manga would strike us as annoying, distracting, simplistic, unrelatable, weird, and so on. But this is how all spectator entertainment feels at first.</p>

<p>Once we acclimate to to a spectator humor profile, it becomes unnoticeably normal—and the spectator humor profile does what it’s supposed to do, which is to efficiently convey information about the character’s evaluations. </p>

<p>At that point, we roll everything together as part of the experience, and nothing in particular stands out to us as unusual.</p>


<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Video and text example:</button>
            
    <div class="content-example">


<p>We don't usually notice conventions in novels as artificial or stilted, because we're so used to them <callback>("laughed softly")</callback>. That's because novels aren't trying for realism for realism's sake—instead, the they're trying to efficiently convey the evaluations of the characters to the reader.</p> 

<p>We stop noticing the methods they use to convey these evaluations once we acclimate to the spectator humor profiles novels give to their characters.</p>

<p>For instance, we probably didn't bat an eye at Rhett "laughing softly" in the passage from <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. But when we watch an actor in this scene, we can imagine how there are so many interpretations of "laughing softly" that it's not as "realistic" a discription as we sometimes assume:</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrhNPS4nbmQ?si=PU1bpfmIPD1xRTKC&amp;start=77&amp;end=132" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Does the actor playing Rhett is still using a spectator humor profile. Movies at the time liked to have characters stand close together and speak in measured, complete sentences. When Rhett gets up and walks over to Scarlett, it's not trying to mirror life but serve the conventions and limitations of camera-work, scriptwriting, and audio capture.</p>
 
<p>On a broader level, the actor's humor is fun to watch but not a mirror of real life. In comparative videos, people would be able to identify which video had acted humor and which had felt humor. That's because the actor is using a spectator humor profile, even though we're so used to them in movies we sometimes lose track of this. </p>
  
 <p>The point of all this isn't to take away from spectator entertainment, whether novels or movies—since spectator entertainment isn't trying to be emotionally realistic for its own sake. Instead, the point is just to recognize how depictions of humor are different than how humor is experienced and expressed in our own interpersonal lives.

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Text from the novel:</button>

<div class="content-example">

<p>"Sir, you should have made known your presence."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"  His white teeth gleamed and his bold dark eyes laughed at her.  "But you were the intruder.  I was forced to wait for Mr. Kennedy, and feeling that I was perhaps persona non grata in the back yard, I was thoughtful enough to remove my unwelcome presence here where I thought I would be undisturbed.  But, alas!" he shrugged and laughed softly.</p>

<p>Her temper was beginning to rise again at the thought that this rude and impertinent man had heard everything--heard things she now wished she had died before she ever uttered.</p>

<p>"Eavesdroppers--" she began furiously. "Eavesdroppers often hear highly entertaining and instructive things," he grinned.  "From a long experience in eavesdropping, I--"</p>

<p>"Sir," she said, "you are no gentleman!"</p>

<p>"An apt observation," he answered airily.  "And, you, Miss, are no lady."  He seemed to find her very amusing, for he laughed softly again.  "No one can remain a lady after saying and doing what have just overheard.  However, ladies have seldom held any charms for me.  I know what they are thinking, but they never have the courage or lack of breeding to say what they think.  And that, in
    time, becomes a bore.  But you, my dear Miss O'Hara, are a girl of rare spirit, very admirable spirit, and I take off my hat to you. I fail to understand what charms the elegant Mr. Wilkes can hold
    for a girl of your tempestuous nature.  He should thank God on bended knee for a girl with your--how did he put it?--'passion for living,' but being a poor-spirited wretch--"</p>

<p>"You aren't fit to wipe his boots!" she shouted in rage.</p>

<p>"And you were going to hate him all your life!"  He sank down on the sofa and she heard him laughing.</p>
