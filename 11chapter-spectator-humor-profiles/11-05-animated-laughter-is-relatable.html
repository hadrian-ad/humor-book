Laughter makes things emotionally vivid
</h1>

<p>It's not just harder to pretend laughter in live action spectator entertainment&mdash;it's harder to have characters laugh together!</p> 

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
     <p class="considertext">On top of having to pretend to laugh, and do so on set&mdash;actors also have to do it with other actors!</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">This creates additional challenges to creating scenes involving group laughter&mdash;the scenes we often find most emotionally resonant.</p> 
     </div>
     
<p>Animated shows not only have more nuanced and varied laugh-like noises&mdash;characters laugh together more often:</p>

<p>In the show above, characters briefly have a large OK which allows them to share large mistakes to generate humor.

<p>When characters laugh together, we often experience these scenes as having relatability, emotional depth, and greater coherence.</p>

<p><headline>Translation.</headline> One reason live-action characters don't always translate well to animation and vice versa is laughing.</p> 

<p>Real laughing doesn't superimpose well over many styles of animations&mdash;just like a lot of noise-laughter doesn't look convincing when done on camera.</p>
               
<p>This ends up making many live adaptions of animation things feel flat&mdash;since its the laughing that provides a lot of the emotional connection to the character.</p>

     <p><headline>Resonance.</headline> 
            In part because , live-action shows often focus around mistake-predominant emotions instead of humor, in part because they struggle to convincingly present nuanced, intense humor.
            
            It's harder to do scenes with shared laughter in live-action scenes than in animated scenes&mdash;not only do live-action actors have less leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laugh, but <sem>then</sem> have to do so convincingly on set and on camera!</p>

<p>We interpret the repetitive noises the voice actor is making as laughter—but it's not actually laughing, just repetitive random noises! (We can see this for ourselves by imitating Frink's laughter.)</p>

<p>In fact, almost any kind of repetitive noise we make could be superimposed over an animated character laughing, and be interpreted by others as laughing—even though it's actually just a random repetitive noise!</p>

   <div class="content-example">


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pxrz2pzHEG4?si=qUHbIB3pDyyucTd-&amp;start=94&amp;end=107" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This kind of shared laughter is relatively harder to do well in live shows than animated shows. Voice actors have more leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laughs, which they can then do consistently. These laughs are often one of our strongest point of recall for them.</p>


<p>The presence of nuanced and varied laugh-like noises gives animated shows a feeling of emotional finesse and relatability that's often lacking in film.</p>

<p>For instance, in this clip two characters who were at first testy rivals have been forced to collaborate and develop mutual respect for each other. With a larger OK and understanding of each other, they share faults that generate large mistakes&mdash;generating humor. They feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>Since animated shows have an easier time displaying intensity, duration, and lean toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance, we experience them as having emotional depth. A live action show would struggle to convincingly display intense humor like this, making the emotional activity feel flat. </p>


</div>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Example #2 (Film):</button>
   
   <div class="content-example">

<p>We find distinctive spectator laughs to be memorable and relatable, whether in film or animation. In this clip one character has a memorable, non-standard spectator laugh, while the other has a forgettable, standard spectator laugh:</p> 


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVXU6p2QaKU?si=S7DP0e7ojluw0AYg&amp;end=21" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>One one hand, the distinctive laugh is <term>familiar</term> to our lives, since we hear distinctive laughs like this relatively frequently. On the other hand, it's <em>unfamiliar</em> to movies, since we rarely hear laughs like this from main characters that aren't part of an explicit gag. In the end, the unusual laugh makes the character relatable and memorable.
