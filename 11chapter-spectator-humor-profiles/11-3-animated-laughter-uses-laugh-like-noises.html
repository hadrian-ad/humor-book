Animated laughter uses laugh-like noises

<p>While we don't usually find memorable laughs in <term>live-action</term> spectator entertainment, we often <sem>do</sem> find memorable laughs in animated spectator entertainment.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p> 
    <p class="for-instance-text">Most of the characters in <i>The Simpsons</i> have distinctive laughs. If we’re familiar with the show, we can recall how most of the cast laughs:</p>

<p>One of the reasons we can remember so many distinctive laugh-like noises for many animated characters, but not live-action characters, is that voice actors have a lot of leeway to create distinctive laughs.</p>

<p>Voice actors can focus on making sounds without worrying about how they look doing so! With no camera on them, it doesn't matter how much or how little they look like they're actually laughing.</p>

<p>Even though we interpret characters in animated spectator entertainment as <term>laughing</term>, the actors are more often than not just making <em>noises</em>. They can make almost random noises. When these noises superimposed over cartoon animations of laughter, the noises are interpreted as laughter.</p>

<p>We interpret the repetitive noises the voice actor is making as laughter—but it's not actually laughing, just repetitive random noises! (We can see this for ourselves by imitating Frink's laughter.)</p>

<p>In fact, almost any kind of repetitive noise we make could be superimposed over an animated character laughing, and be interpreted by others as laughing—even though it's actually just a random repetitive noise!</p>

    </div>
    </div>

<p>We relate to characters with coherent, vivid spectator humor profiles. This is one reason we often find characters in animated comedies to be emotionally responsive and relatable, while sitcome characters often feel flat by comparison.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Example #1 (Animation):</button>
   
   <div class="content-example">


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pxrz2pzHEG4?si=qUHbIB3pDyyucTd-&amp;start=94&amp;end=107" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This kind of shared laughter is relatively harder to do well in live shows than animated shows. Voice actors have more leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laughs, which they can then do consistently. These laughs are often one of our strongest point of recall for them.</p>


<p>The presence of nuanced and varied laugh-like noises gives animated shows a feeling of emotional finesse and relatability that's often lacking in film.</p>

<p>For instance, in this clip two characters who were at first testy rivals have been forced to collaborate and develop mutual respect for each other. With a larger OK and understanding of each other, they share faults that generate large mistakes&mdash;generating humor. They feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>Since animated shows have an easier time displaying intensity, duration, and lean toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance, we experience them as having emotional depth. A live action show would struggle to convincingly display intense humor like this, making the emotional activity feel flat. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Example #2 (Film):</button>
   
   <div class="content-example">

<p>We find distinctive spectator laughs to be memorable and relatable, whether in film or animation. In this clip one character has a memorable, non-standard spectator laugh, while the other has a forgettable, standard spectator laugh:</p> 


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVXU6p2QaKU?si=S7DP0e7ojluw0AYg&amp;end=21" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>One one hand, the distinctive laugh is <term>familiar</term> to our lives, since we hear distinctive laughs like this relatively frequently. On the other hand, it's <em>unfamiliar</em> to movies, since we rarely hear laughs like this from main characters that aren't part of an explicit gag. In the end, the unusual laugh makes the character relatable and memorable.

    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Memorability.</headline> Some characters have memorable humor tells, like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
        
        <li>Han Solo’s lopsided smile</li> 
        <li>Fox Mulder’s enthusiastic grin</li>
        <li>James Bond’s smirk</li> 
        <li>Harry Potter’s shy smile</li>
        <li>Jack Sparrow's half-of-face smile</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
 
<p>But even though these humor tells are <term>memorable</term>, they're not <em>laughs</em>—and we’ll struggle to remember scenes where those same characters gave medium-intensity or higher laughs.</p>

<p>Even if a scene does come to mind, we’ll probably either not really remember the sound of the laugh itself—or remember the sound as not particularly convincing. That’s because it’s hard to act any laughter on command&mdash;let alone create a signature laugh for a character!</p>
