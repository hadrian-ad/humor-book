Animated laughter uses laugh-like noises
</h1>


We rarely find memorable laughs in live-action spectator entertainment. But we often do find memorable laughs in animated spectator entertainment.

For instance, most of the characters in The Simpsons have distinctive laughs. If we’re familiar with the show, we can recall how most of the cast laughs when we see pictures of them:



Marge has a nasal “Hm!hmhmhm”
Homer has a hearty “BWAH!ha-ha-ha-ha!”
Bart has a trouble-maker’s “eh heh heh hah ha”
Lisa has a snacking “hheh hheeh haw haw.”  
(and so on)

These noises strike us as laughter when superimposed over cartoon animations—but the actors make these noises in a recording booth don’t look or sound as if they were laughing.

> Consider:

Below, the voice actor for Professor Frink is making repetitive noises that we interpret as laughter—even though if we try to imitate it ourselves, we'll see it's just random noises!






We can try making almost any kind of repetitive noise. If we imagine that noise superimposed over a character animated as laughing, we can see that the noise could be received as laugh-like by an audience—even though it’s just a random repetitive noise.

Actors in animated shows have a lot of leeway to create distinctive laughs, since they can create noises without having to also act out other humor tells for a camera at the same time.

This is why we can remember distinctive laugh-like noises for many animated characters, but not live-action characters.

Since characters in animated comedies have distinctive laughter, we tend to think of them as emotionally responsive and relatable. This contrasts with sitcom characters, where the infrequent and often lackluster laughter often makes the characters feel flat.
