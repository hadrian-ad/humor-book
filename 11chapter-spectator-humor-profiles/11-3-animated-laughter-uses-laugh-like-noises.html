Animated laughter uses laugh-like noises
</h1>


<p>While we don't usually find memorable laughs in live-action spectator entertainment, we often <sem>do</sem> find memorable laughs in animated spectator entertainment.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p> 
    <p class="for-instance-text">Most of the characters in <i>The Simpsons</i> have distinctive laughs. If we’re familiar with the show, we can recall how most of the cast laughs:</p>

            <li>Homer has a hearty <callback>“BWAH!ha-ha-ha-ha!”</callback></li>
            <li>Bart has a troublemaker’s <callback>“eh heh heh hah ha”</callback></li>
            <li>Lisa has a snacking <callback>“hheh hheeh haw haw.”</callback></li>

    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">By contrast, we can take any of our favorite live action shows—and probably find that we remember fewer consistent cast laughs.</p>

<p>One of the reasons we can remember so many distinctive laugh-like noises for many <term>animated</term> characters, but not <em>live-action</em> characters, is that voice actors have a lot of leeway to create distinctive laughs.</p>

<p>Voice actors can focus on making sounds without worrying about how they look doing so! They can make almost random noises that, when superimposed over cartoon animations, are interpreted as laughter.</p>

<p>Even though we interpret characters in animated spectator entertainment as <term>laughing</term>, the actors are more often than not just making <em>noises</em>—the actors making these noises in the recording booth don't look or sound as if they were really laughing.</p>


<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Video example:</button>

<div class="content-example">

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5QbrRRMg20?start=15" title="YouTube video player" width="560"></iframe>



<p>We interpret the repetitive noises the voice actor is making as laughter—but it's not actually laughing, just repetitive random noises! We can see this for ourselves by imitating Frink's laughter.</p>

<p>In fact, almost any kind of repetitive noise we make could be superimposed over an animated character laughing, and be interpreted by others as laughing—even though it's actually just a random repetitive noise!</p>

    </div>

<p>We relate to characters with coherent, vivid spectator humor profiles. This is one reason we often find characters in animated comedies to be emotionally responsive and relatable, while sitcome characters often feel flat by comparison</p>


    <div class="box">

<p><headline>Memorability.</headline> Some characters have memorable humor tells, like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
        
        <li>Han Solo’s lopsided smile</li> 
        <li>Fox Mulder’s enthusiastic grin</li>
        <li>James Bond’s smirk</li> 
        <li>Harry Potter’s shy smile</li>
        <li>Jack Sparrow's bottom-half-of-face smile</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
 
<p>But even though these humor tells are <term>memorable</term>, they're not <em>laughs</em>—and we’ll struggle to remember scenes where those same characters gave medium-intensity or higher laughs.</p>

<p>Even if a scene does come to mind, we’ll probably either not really remember the sound of the laugh itself—or remember the sound as not particularly convincing. That’s because it’s hard to act any laughter on command, let alone create a signature laugh for a character!</p>
