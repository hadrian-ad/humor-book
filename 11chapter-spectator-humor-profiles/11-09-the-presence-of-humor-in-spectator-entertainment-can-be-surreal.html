The presence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>Sometimes the <term>absence</term> of humor is surreal&mdash;but other times the <em>presence</em> of humor is surreal.</p> 
    
    <p>This is often most noticeable in advertisements or corporate videos:</p> 

    <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-09-presence-surreal/11-9-0-multiple-graphs.png"

title="Smiling advertisements"
alt="There are three images of advertisements. 1) an airline steward smiles broadly, 2) a woman spays chemical fragrance while smiling heroically, 3) an illustration of a woman in an old poster advertisemt smiles with wonder as she examines a can of food."
style="max-width: 40rem; margin-left: "
>



<p>The smile made by the airline steward is surreal—it’s uncomfortable to show teeth for very long and to not adjust our smiles. It’s not something people do in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
<p class="considertext">The spectator humor profiles in advertisements are so familiar that we no longer notice them as unrealistic. It's not until we stop to pay attention that we realize how odd they are&mdash;and how our friends would be concerned if we tried to express humor how the characters in advertisements often do.
            </p>    

    </div>

<p>Similarly, we can spot surrealness in the advertisement below by asking: <i>“who is the women in the sewing machine advertisement smiling at?” </i>The answer is simultaneously no one and everyone—it’s surreal!</p>

title="Smiling advertisements"
alt="An old advertisement in Japanese shows a woman at a new fancy home sewing machine making eye-contact and smiling at us. An annotation asks 'who is the woman smiling at?'"
style="max-width: ; margin-left: "

<p>Emotional surrealism is often enjoyable or effective—there’s nothing inherently wrong or right about it. But it can become a problem if we start thinking that emotionally surreal things reflect the world more straightforwardly than they really do.</p>

    <p>There are many surreal elements to this advertisement—like at the end, when the actor takes a distant sniff of her shoes while pretending to hold a camera or phone, with the editors adding a sound effect (a sigh of delight). Then the actor looks at the camera she's pretending to hold, and smiles. The editors add in a giggle as a sound effect. </p>

    <p>
    Do people go <callback>"ha ha ha?"</callback> Not really&mdash;not any more than cars go <callback>"vroom!"</callback> or falling pancakes go <callback>"splat!"</callback></p> 
    
     <p>That's why people in the United States tend to write <callback>"ha ha ha,"</callback> but many people in Europe tend to write <callback>"ah ah ah" </callback>instead&mdash;and why the convention in Brazil for a while was to write <callback>"kkkkkkk."</callback> These are just conventions for indicating laughter, so they vary.</p> 
     
    
    <div class="consider">
        Consider:
            <p class=considertext>What sound do cats make? English speakers say cats go <callback>"meow,"</callback> but German speakers say cats go <callback>"miau,"</callback>&mdash;and Japanese speakers <callback>"nya."</callback></p> 
            
            <p class=considertext>These aren't meant to be "real" noises cats make&mdash;since cats make all kinds of nontranscribable noises. Instead, <callback>"meow,"</callback> <callback>"miau,"</callback> <callback>"nya,"</callback> and so on are just abstract conventions. It's the same with written laughter.</p>
    </div>
                       
    <p>There's no exact way to transcribe even a single instance of laughing&mdash;let alone one way to transcribe <sem-weak>all</sem-weak> the variations of a laugh. Something  like <callback>"ha ha ha"</callback> is just how some <sem-weak>reference</sem-weak> laughter in writing.</p>
                        
   
    
    <p>Sometimes people take these conventions too seriously. <callback>"Moo"</callback> is the written word for the noises cows makes&mdash;which isn't how a cow literally sounds. But if we take written conventions too seriously, we start expecting cows to literally be saying <callback>"moo"</callback> over and over again&mdash;which is a bit like expecting a pancake to say <callback>"splat!"</callback> when it falls onto the floor.</p>
        
<p>Something similar happens with laughter. Actors sometimes literally say <callback>"ha ha ha"</callback> because that's how it's written&mdash;like how Santa actors will often literally say <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> because that's how it's written.</p> 
            
    <p><callback>"Ho ho ho"</callback> was a written convention for Santa, since it conveyed more of a good-natured, full-body laugh than other vowels. <callback>("Ha ha ha," "huh huh huh," "hee hee hee," and so on.</callback>) But actually <sem>saying</sem> <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> aloud instead of laughing is a bit odd—like an actor literally saying <callback>"zzz"</callback> when pretending to sleep, or a video editor adding the spoken word <callback>"bam!"</callback> to the sound of a discharging gun.</p>
       
    <p>There's nothing inherently wrong with saying <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback>—since, like any spectator humor profile, <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> serves various purposes outside of being realistic. However, <sem>we</sem> can be wrong if we lose sight that these spectator profiles <callback>("Santa Clause humor profile")</callback> are surreal&mdash;and not literally laughter.</p>

<p>Surreal things create medium-specific humor patterns due to their constraints in presenting humor. These various humor patterns are "spectator humor profiles," which allow those mediums to convey evaluatory information.</p>

<ul>
   <li>When we become familiar with different <a href="11-00-spectator-humor-profiles.html">spectator humor profiles</a>, they start seeming normal&mdash;but normal is different than "real." These spectator humor profiles aren't perfect mirrors of our lives&mdash;they're surreal.
   </li> 
   
   <li>Spectator entertainment often takes advantage of <a href="11-07-spectators-and-spectator-characters-are-usually-desynchronized.html">desynchronized evaluations</a>&mdash;the characters feel one thing while the spectators feel another. This gap allows for divergent situations and evaluations, like us laughing when they (a character) gets hit by a bus.</li> 
    
    <li>Both the <a href="11-08-the-absence-of-humor-can-be-surreal.html">absence and the presence</a> of humor in spectator entertainment can be surreal. The humor doesn't always occur where it would in real life, and sometimes occurs where it wouldn't.</li>
