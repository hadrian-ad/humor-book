The presence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>Sometimes the <term>absence</term> of humor is surreal&mdash;but other times the <em>presence</em> of humor is surreal.</p> 
    
    <p>This is often most noticeable in advertisements or corporate videos:</p>

<p>The smile made by the air steward is surreal—it’s uncomfortable to show teeth for very long and to not adjust our smiles. It’s not something people do in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
<p class="considertext">The spectator humor profiles in advertisements are so familiar that we no longer notice them as unrealistic. It's not until we stop to pay attention that we realize how odd they are&mdash;and how our friends would be concerned if we tried to express humor how the characters in advertisements often do.
            </p>    

    </div>

<p>Similarly, we can spot surrealness in the advertisement below by asking: <i>“who is the women in the sewing machine advertisement smiling at?” </i>The answer is simultaneously no one and everyone—it’s surreal!</p>

<p>Emotional surrealism is often enjoyable or effective—there’s nothing inherently wrong or right about it. But it can become a problem if we start thinking that emotionally surreal things reflect the world more straightforwardly than they really do.</p>

    <p>There are many surreal elements to this advertisement—like at the end, when the actor takes a distant sniff of her shoes while pretending to hold a camera or phone, with the editors adding a sound effect (a sigh of delight). Then the actor looks at the camera she's pretending to hold, and smiles. The editors add in a giggle as a sound effect. </p>

    <p>
    Do people go <callback>"ha ha ha?"</callback> Not really&mdash;any more than cars go <callback>"crash!"</callback> or falling pancakes go <callback>"splat!"</callback></p> 
    
    <p>It's a lot like the sound cats make. English speakers say cats go <callback>"meow,"</callback> but German speakers say cats go <callback>"miau,"</callback>&mdash;and Japanese speakers <callback>"nya."</callback> These aren't meant to be "real" noises cats make. Instead, <callback>"meow,"</callback> <callback>"miau,"</callback> <callback>"nya,"</callback> and so on are just abstract conventions that refer to all kinds of nontranscribable noises that cats make.</p>
    
    <p>It's the same with <callback>"ha ha ha."</callback> Like with the sounds that cats make, there's no exact way to transcribe even a single instance of laughing—let alone one way to transcribe all the variations of a laugh. Things like <callback>"ha ha ha"</callback> are just conventions some people use for some <sem-weak>writing</sem-weak> laughter.</p>
                        
    <p>These conventions change, place-by-place and time-by-time. People in the United States tend to write <callback>"ha ha ha."</callback>, but many people in Europe tend to write <callback>"ah ah ah"</callback>&mdash;and many people in Brazil write <callback>"kkkkkkk."</callback></p> 
    
    <p>Sometimes people take these conventions too seriously. The word for the noise a cow makes is <callback>"moo."</callback> But sometimes people start expecting cows to literally be saying the word <callback>"moo"</callback> over and over again&mdash;which is a bit like expecting a pancake to say <callback>"splat"</callback> when it falls onto the floor.</p>
        
<p>Something similar happens with laughter. We sometimes see actors go <callback>"ha ha ha"</callback> because that's how it's written&mdash;like how Santa actors will literally say <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> because that's how it's written.</p> 
            
    <p><callback>"Ho ho ho"</callback> was a written convention for Santa, since it conveyed more of a good-natured, full-body laugh than other vowels <callback>("ha ha ha"</callback> or <callback>"hee hee hee"</callback>). But actually <sem>saying</sem> <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> aloud instead of laughing is a bit odd—like an actor literally saying <callback>"zzz"</callback> when pretending to sleep, or a video editor adding the spoken word <callback>"bam!"</callback> to the sound of firing a gun.</p>
       
    <p>The point here isn't that there's something wrong with saying <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback>—since, like any spectator humor profile, it serves various purposes. Instead, the point is that these spectator profiles <callback>("Santa Clause humor profile")</callback> are surreal—people who literally go <callback>"ho ho ho"</callback> are doing something else than laughing.</p> 
    
    Like a lot around spectator humor profiles and spectator entertainment, we can make observational errors if we lose sight of this.

<p>When we produce things for an emotional effect, the medium confers constraints. One way we adapt to these constraints is by giving them their own internal pattern of humor tells. These various internal patterns are "spectator humor profiles."</p>

<ul>
   <li><a href="11-0-spectator-humor-profiles.html">Spectator humor profiles</a> seem normal to us when we get used to them&mdash;but normal is different than "real." The humor tells in spectator entertainment are surreal&mdash;they're not meant to be a perfect mirror of our lives.</li> 
    
   <li>Spectator entertainment often takes advantage of <a href="11-4-spectators-and-spectator-characters-are-usually-desynchronized.html">desynchronized evaluations</a>. The characters feel one thing, the spectators feel another. This creates the gap that allows for divergent situations and evaluations, like laughing when a character gets hit by a bus.</li> 
    
    <li>Both the <a href="11-6-the-presence-of-humor-in-spectator-entertainment-can-be-surreal.html">absence and the presence</a> of humor in spectator entertainment can be surreal—the humor doesn't always occur where it would in real life, and sometimes occurs where it wouldn't.</li>
