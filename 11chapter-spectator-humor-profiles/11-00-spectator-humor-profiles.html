       <p class="overtitle">Spectator Humor Profile</p>
       
</div>

<p>Last chapter we looked at <a href="../10chapter-spectator-entertainment/10-0-spectator-entertainment.html#exclude-navigation">spectator entertainment</a>. In this chapter, we’ll look at how artists, actors, characters, and so on depict humor in spectator entertainment&mdash;<vocab>spectator humor profiles</vocab>.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">We said before that each person has a <a href="../9chapter-humor-profile/9-0-humor-profile.html#exclude-navigation">humor profile</a>. Our humor profile is how we express humor tells, specific to ourselves.</p> 
   
<p class="considertext">But if we act in a play, we won't transplant our actual humor profile to the stage wholesale. Instead, we'll use a spectator humor profile.</p> 
    </div>

<p>   
    We can usually tell the difference between the actor <term>acting</term> humor tells <callback>(spectator humor profile)</callback> and the actor themselves <em>feeling</em> humor <callback>(personal humor profile)</callback>—in part because the humor we feel is so much more nuanced and vivid than the humor we can act out:</p>

title="Spectator humor profile versus personal humor profiles"
alt="This image has two columns to compare spectator humor profiles and personal humor profiles. One the left, an actor smirks rogueishly (spectator humor profile). On the right, the same actor smiles between takes, which looks full and real(personal humor profile)."

title="Personal humor profiles"
alt="An actor holds another actor and they smile and laugh. An annotation says 'we can tell these are personal humor profiles, and not spectator humor profiles."

title="We can differentiate between spectator humor profiles and personal humor profiles."
alt="On the left, a heartthrob actor smiles becomingly at the camera. On the right, the same actor smiles behind the scenes, which looks messily real. Annotations note that we can distinquish between spectator humor profiles and personal humor profiles."

<p>We don’t always notice how artificial acted humor is until someone points it out—but then it's something that's hard to unsee.</p>


<p>We'll be talking more about spectator humor profiles throughout this chapter.</p>
