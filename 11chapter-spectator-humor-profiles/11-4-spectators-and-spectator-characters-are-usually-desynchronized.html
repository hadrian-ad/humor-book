Spectators and spectator characters are usually desynchronized
</h1>

We’re usually emotionally desynchronized from spectator characters. While we feel humor, the characters are often being perplexed, bickering, complaining, crying, making mistakes, getting hurt, and so on:

Similarly, when characters laugh, we don’t usually laugh along with them:

 

Owen is watching Animated Guy.

Billy the Dog: “Well, maybe we should just go to Leanne and tell her the truth.”

A. Pierre: “heeheeheeheeheehee” (&larr;Pierre laughs when Owen doesn’t) “Oh wait, you’re serious? Oh my god Billy. We can’t tell Leanne the truth. She’d skin me! Tell you what. Let’s tell her a bigger lie instead.”

Billy: “What, Pierre, no!”

Pierre: *already in the kitchen talking to Leanne*

B. Billy: *gasps*

Owen: *laughs* (&larr;Owen laughs when Pierre and Billy don’t)

Emma is watching Fired Fireman 4. The imposingly cool space captain comes across Chief eating some bright-colored candy.

Space captain: *standing heroically* (condescendingly) “You’re eating candy?”

Chief: *munching* “Yes. Want some?” *holds out box*

Captain: *throws back head* *laughs* *laughs more* (&larr;captain laughs when Emma doesn’t) (suddenly sober) *sits down* (sadly) “Yes.”

Chief shakes some colored candies into his cupped hands.

Emma: *laughs* (&larr;Emma laughs when captain doesn’t)

Unlike a conversation, the spectators and the characters don’t need to have synchronized evaluations. This is one of spectator entertainment's distinctive qualities.

If spectator entertainment tried to keep the audience and characters synchronized, it would forfeit one of the distinctive opportunities of spectator entertainment.

> Consider:

Sometimes spectator entertainment tries to make the audience feel the same emotion as a character, but this isn't the general goal of most spectator entertainment—and especially not for most comedies.

    <div class="contentBOX">

    Laugh tracks. It was an odd experience to transition from live theaters to radio or television. People were suddenly supposed to laugh by themselves, alone in an empty room! It was an isolating, often unsettling transition.
 
Showrunners eased this transition by using laugh tracks, or audio from live audiences—which simulated being part of a theater audience. It also maintained a cadence of dialogue that would be familiar to theater goers to. ("Comment" *pause for laughter* "Comment" *pause for laughter.*)

As audiences acclimated to watching things alone on their TV, laugh tracks lost their importance. And as the familiarity with live spectator entertainment shrank, laugh tracks also started being seen as puzzling or senseless. TVs were no longer seen as replacing live entertainment, but were their own thing.

Laugh tracks initially helped viewers learn to do what most of us do intuitively now: we're supposed to emotionally synchronized toward the invisible audience laughing, not the characters. By increasing a feeling of separation from the characters, and creating the feeling of being part of a group, showrunners could raise a spectator's OK.
