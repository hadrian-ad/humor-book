Spectators and spectator characters are usually desynchronized
</h1>

    <p>The audience is usually emotionally <term>desynchronized</term> from spectator characters.</p>
    
<p>When talking with a friend, we usually feel humor at the same time <callback>(emotionally synchronized)</callback>. But when watching a character, we don't usually feel humor at the same time <callback>(emotionally desynchronized)</callback>.</p> 
    
    <p>This is often obvious in comedies. While the <em>characters</em> are perplexed, bickering, complaining, crying, making mistakes, getting hurt, and so on—<em>we</em> are feeling humor:</p>

<p>The opposite is often true—in comedies, we don't usually laugh when the <em>characters</em> laugh:</p>

<p>Unlike a conversation, the spectators and the characters don’t need to have synchronized evaluations. This is one of spectator entertainment's distinctive qualities.</p>

<p>If spectator entertainment tried to keep the audience and characters synchronized, it would forfeit one of the distinctive opportunities of spectator entertainment.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">Sometimes spectator entertainment tries to make the audience feel the same emotion as a character, but this isn't the general goal of most spectator entertainment—and especially not for most comedies.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Why laugh tracks?</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

    <p>Tranisitioning from live theaters to radio or television was an odd experience for people—you were suddenly supposed to laugh by yourself, alone in an empty room! It was an isolating, often unsettling transition—like switching from an in-person classroom to a remote classroom.</p>
 
<p>Showrunners eased this transition by simulating being in an audience—they would record a show with a live audience, or add laugh tracks. This carried remnants of the experience of seeing things "live," and maintained a familiar cadence of dialogue. <callback>("Line of dialogue" *pause for laughter* "Line of dialogue" *pause for laughter.*)</callback></p>

<p>Over time, audiences acclimated to watching things alone or as part of a tiny audience on their TV—and so laugh tracks lost their importance. Eventually, they became seen as archaic, puzzling, and in the way of the newest styles and genres. At this point,  TVs were no longer seen as <i>replacing</i> live entertainment, but simply <em>were</em> entertainment.</p>

<p>During this transition, laugh tracks helped viewers learn to emotionally synchronize toward the <em>audience</em>, not toward the characters. Most of this do this intuitively—like if we watch a sitcom where someone has to hide their guest in a closet, we side with the "audience" instead of  with the characters. This lets us laugh, with the audience, instead of be stressed, like the character.</p>
