Spectators and spectator characters are usually desynchronized
</h1>

    <p>The audience is usually emotionally <vocab>desynchronized</vocab> from spectator characters. The audience feels one thing, and the characters a different thing.</p>
    
<p>In interpersonal interactions, everyone <term>converges</term> toward synchronized emotions. If one person is angry, soon either both people are angry or both people are calm. <callback>(emotionally synchronized)</callback></p>

 <p>But in spectator entertainment, we often have peolpe <em>diverging</em> into desynchronized emotions. If a character is insulted, they'll have mistake-predominant emotions while we laugh. <callback>(emotionally desynchronized)</callback> 
   
    <p>This is often obvious in comedies. While the <term>characters</term> are perplexed, bickering, complaining, crying, making mistakes, getting hurt, and so on—<em>we</em> are feeling humor:</p>

<p>Similarly in comedies, when the <term>characters</term> laugh <em>we're</em> usally feeling something other than humor:</p>

<p>Unlike a conversation, the spectators and the characters don’t need to have synchronized evaluations. This is one of spectator entertainment's distinctive qualities.</p>

<p>If spectator entertainment tried to keep the audience and characters synchronized, it would forfeit one of the distinctive opportunities of spectator entertainment.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext"><term>Sometimes</term> spectator entertainment tries to make the audience feel the same emotion as a character, but this isn't the <em>general</em> goal of most spectator entertainment—and especially not for most comedies.</p>

    <p><headline>Why laugh tracks.</headline> Tranisitioning from live theaters to radio or television was an odd experience for people—you were suddenly supposed to laugh by yourself, alone in an empty room! It was an isolating, often unsettling transition—like switching from an in-person classroom to a remote classroom.</p>
 
<p>Showrunners eased this transition by <sem>simulating</sem> being in an audience—they would record a show with a live audience, or add laugh tracks. This carried remnants of the experience of seeing things "live," while also maintaining a familiar cadence of dialogue. <callback>("Line of dialogue" *pause for laughter* "Line of dialogue" *pause for laughter.*)</callback></p>

<p>Over time, audiences acclimated to watching things alone or as part of a tiny audience on their TV—and so laugh tracks lost their importance. Eventually, they became seen as archaic, puzzling, and in the way of new changes in styles and genres. At this point,  TVs were no longer seen as <term>replacing</term> live entertainment, but simply <em>were</em> entertainment.</p>

<p>During this transition, laugh tracks helped viewers learn to emotionally synchronize toward a hypothetical <term>audience</term>, not toward the <em>characters</em>. This lets us laugh, with the audience, instead of be stressed or bored, like the character.</p>

<p>Most of this do this intuitively—if a character in a comedy gets injured and ugly cries, we laugh and are frustrated if someone we're watching it with keeps synchronizing with the character.</p>
