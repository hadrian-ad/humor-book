Constraints on representation
</h1>

<p>

<p>There are many reasons spectator humor profiles are they way they are in movies. In addition to physicaly limitations <callback>(we can't convincingly produce high-intensity humor on demand)</callback>, it's often that the priorities aren't on realism for realism's sake.</p>

<p>A movie may:</p>

<ul><li><sem>Prioritize camera shots.</sem>
      If a movie wants a clear shot of a face, the director will instruct the actor not to put their hands near their heads when pretending to laugh. This prevents a common humor tell from being represented in many movies.</li>
    
    <li><sem>Prioritize pacing.</sem> When we laugh in conversation, the laughter may take up 25% of the conversation&mdash;but for pacing reasons, movies don't want laughter to take up 25% of a scene! This shapes how actors, screenwriters, directors, and editors portray humor.</li>

    <p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds longâ€”10% of the scene!</p>

    <p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>

      <sem>Prioritize what's flattering on camera.</sem> Some movies rarely let actors or characters <sem-weak>blink</sem-weak> on screen, let alone scrunch their eyes when they smile. Genuine smiles contort our faces&mdash;and movies can stylistic choices to avoid that:</li>

  <p>Instead, <sem-weak>we</sem-weak> can be wrong if we assume that movies are straightforward mirrors of real life. Movies have constraints and goals that aren't simply realism for realism's sake.</p>
  
  
  <!--
    <p class="considertext">That's because what we enjoy is often inverted between spectator entertainment and real life. A smirk can be fun in a movie <callback>(but infuriating in real life)</callback>, just like an open-eyed, tight smile can be nice in a movie <callback>(but unsettling in real life)</callback>.</p>

        <p><headline>Social media.</headline> Successful photos for social media or business promotion often look better than they feel to take. We prioritize how the <term>viewers</term> feel <term>looking</term> at our picture over how <em>we</em> feel <em>taking</em> the picture.</p>
            
             <p>A candid picture of us grinning on our futon may be very accurate&mdash;but this kind of accuracy isn't the goal of many photographs. Instead, the photographer may tell us to cross our arms and tilt our torso in a way that feels stilted, but that is recieved positively by viewers.</p> 
             
             <p>This is a familiar instance of a spectator humor profile&mdash;which is similar to how actors feel representing humor.</p>

<h2>Movies prioritize their own goals</h2>
    
 <div class="h2"> 
     
 <p>Movies make choices prioritizing their audience&mdash;and so how humor is pretended is in service of a variety of other goals other than realism for realism's sake.</p>
    
    <p>We can see this in a movie like <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title>:</p>

alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 23rem ; margin-left: "

<p>Early in the movie, the actor pretends more realistic humor in order to:</p>
      
<ul class="close-list">
     <li>make Jane feel relatable</li>
     <li>establish Jane's ease and freedom with laughing</li>
      <li>to show her close connection to her sister</li>
      <li>contrast with the formal and awkward Mr. Darcy</li>
      <li>set her emotional baseline for the rest of the story to measure against</li>
      </ul>
          
  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
  
<p>At the conclusion, when Jane and Mr. Darcy share smiles, the production team has the actor linger in the shot with an unrealistic smile in order to:</p>
 
  <ul class="close-list">   
      <li>let the audience take in the actor's face</li>
      <li>draw out an emotional note for pacing</li>
      <li>support the soundtrack</li>
      <li>complete an arc toward a mature happiness</li>
      <li>move the story toward a happily-ever-after conclusion</li>
      <li>better match the character's  emotional cadence to show closeness</li>
                </ul>
     
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
  
      <p>The creators of this movie didn't just tell the actor to smile and laugh. Instead, they told her to smile and laugh in specific ways that harmonized with  overall goals.</p>

      <p>When choosing our senior photo, we don't usually chose the photo that <term>felt</term> best being taken&mdash;but the one that <em>looked </em>best, to spectators.</p>
        
      <p>A picture of us beaming and sitting with friends on a ratty couch may capture us at our interpersonal best&mdash;but it doesn't prioritize the goals of senior photo.</p> 
      
      <p>That's why we we probably took a stilted photo of us in ways we'd never behave in real life&mdash;maybe with a contorted torso and arms crossed in ways that felt awkward but looked good <sem-weak>for a picture</sem-weak>.</p>
      
  <p>Movies and shows are essentially like this always, where they always present humor in a way that looks good on camera but that would be very odd in real life.</p>
