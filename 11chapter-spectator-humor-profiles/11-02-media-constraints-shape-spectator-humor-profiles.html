Media constraints shape spectator humor profiles 
</h1>
   <p>There are a few reason live actors use spectator humor profiles:</p>
   
   <h2>We can't act out humor</h2>
   
<div class="h2"><p>There's a physical limitation&mdash;most actors can’t convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command!</p> 
   
   <div class="consider">
      <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">If we watch a video of our friend doubled over with laughter, and are asked to do it on command&mdash;we can't!</p></div>
    </div>

<h2>Real humor takes too long</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>For pacing reasons, most movies don't want realistic durations of humor. In actual conversations with laughter, the laughter may take up a large proportion of the conversation. But most movies don't want 25% of a scene to be taken up by someone laughing! 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content-example">

<p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds long—10% of the scene!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/si7-GBpm1vU?si=na9oDKeH7bRVebC8&amp;start=72&amp;end=96;" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>

<h2>Humor changes how we look</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we give genuine smiles, our skin crinkles, our lips rise toward our nose, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on. These can go against a movie's stylistic goals.</p>
    
     <p>Some movies rarely lets actors or characters <sem-weak>blink</sem-weak> on screen, let alone scrunch their eyes when they smile. These movies are making a choice to subordinate realism for a stylistic effect.</p>
</div>


<h2>What's appealing gets scrambled</h2>
<div class="h2"><p>In real life, we find people giving genuine broad smiles appealing. But that doesn't mean we feel the same way about people giving broad smiles in spectator entertainment.</p>
        
          
    <p>In the contrasting pictures below, we can immediately tell which one is the actor's <term>spectator</term> humor profile, and which is the actor's <em>interpersonal</em> humor profile. One looks good in a movie, the other would be appealing in real life&mdash;but not necessarily vice versa.</p>
    
                                <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-0-spectator-humor-profiles/11-0-3-han-solo-2.png"
            
            title=""
            alt=""
            style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: "
            >
                        <p>
              
                
 
                    <p>If we were <term>talking</term> to the actor at a bus stop, we'd prefer he smile like he is on the right—since his smile would show he's feeling <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
                     
                     <p>But when we’re simply <em>looking</em> at a still picture, the broad smile looks a bit odd. It's not how we're used to characters expressing humor in movies.</p>
               
            
       </div>


<p>All of these factors shape spectator humor profiles&mdash;the humor tells we do or don't see in movies.</p>

<div class="box">
     <p><headline>Faults.</headline> We can point out something scientifically unrealistic in a movie&mdash;but just pointing this out doesn't mean it's good criticism of the movie. <callback>("You can't hear noises in space, so any movie that has sound happening in space is a bad movie.")</callback> That's because the goal of most movies is the emotional <term>handling</term> of the audience, not <em>realism</em> for realism's sake. <callback>("That space battle was heartpounding!")</callback></p> 
    
    
    <p>It's the same for emotions. It's not a criticism to point out that movies don't mirror emotions perfectly. <callback>("No one smirks like that in real life.")</callback> That's because the priority is the emotional handling of the audience, not emotional realism for realism's sake. <callback>("The scoundrel was my favorite character.")</callback></p>
    
     <p>In general, we criticize movies when the emotional handling feels off, not when the "realism" feels off&mdash;since the realism is often neither here nor there.</p>

<!--
    <div class="box">
        <p>When choosing our senior photo, we don't usually chose the photo that <term>felt</term> best being taken&mdash;but the one that <em>looked </em>best, to spectators.</p>
          
        <p>A picture of us beaming and sitting with friends on a ratty couch may capture us at our interpersonal best&mdash;but it doesn't prioritize the goals of senior photo.</p> 
        
        <p>That's why we we probably took a stilted photo of us in ways we'd never behave in real life&mdash;maybe with a contorted torso and arms crossed in ways that felt awkward but looked good <sem-weak>for a picture</sem-weak>.</p>
        
    <p>Movies and shows are essentially like this always, where they always present humor in a way that looks good on camera but that would be very odd in real life.</p>
