Constraints on representation
</h1>
  
<p>Why don't live movies always have vivid, realistic humor in movies? There are several reasons, which all lead to a specific style of pretended humor in movies:</p>
   
   <h2>We can't act out humor</h2>
   
<div class="h2">
  
  <p>There's a physical limitation&mdash;we can’t convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command!</p> 
  
     <div class="consider">
      <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">If we watch a video of our friend doubled over with laughter, and then are asked to perfectly imitate our friend's laughter&mdash;we can't!</p>
       </div>
  
      <p>Actors, directors, and screenwriters will produce scenes that actors are physically capable of doing.</p> 
        

</div>
    

<h2>Real humor takes too long</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>For pacing reasons, most movies don't want realistic durations of humor&mdash;so actors, screenwriters, directors, and editors will adjust how actors pretend humor.</p> 
    
<div class="consider"> 
           <p class="consider">Consider:</p>   
            <p class="considertext">When we laugh in conversation, the laughter may take up a 25% of the conversation&mdash;but most movies don't want 25% of a scene to be taken up by laughing.</p>
        </div>
    
</div>

<div class="content-example">

<p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds long—10% of the scene!</p>

<p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>

<h2>Humor changes how we look</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we give genuine smiles, our skin crinkles, our lips rise toward our nose, our nose moves, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on:</p>
    
        <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-02-movie-profiles/11-02-0-realism-knightley.png"

title="Pretending realistic humor contorts our face"
alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: "
>

    <p>Whether a movie wants this contortion or not is a stylistic choice&mdash;and the style for many movies are for smooth faces, which often seem standard and correct to us.</p>
            
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">Some movies rarely lets actors or characters <sem-weak>blink</sem-weak> on screen, let alone scrunch their eyes when they smile.</p>
         
          <p class="considertext">These movies are making a stylistic choice&mdash;which all movies do, since the priority is never realism for realism's sake.</p>
    </div>
    
       
        
</div>



<h2>What's appealing gets scrambled</h2>
<div class="h2">
       
       <p>What we want to see in a movie and in real life aren't always aligned:</p>
 
                <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-00-spectator-humor-profiles/11-0-3-han-solo-2.png"
                
                title="Normalcy"
                alt="On the left is an actor smirking rogueishly for the camera. On the right, the same actor smiles normally. An annotation says that the normal smile looks goofy on a camera (even though it would look normal in conversation), while the acted smile looks good on camera (even though it would be offputting in conversation)."
                style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: "
                >
            
               
   
    <p>In a <term>movie</term>, it's charming to see the roguish character smirk as they recieve an award. But in <em>real life</em>, it would be off-putting if someone smirked as they recieved an award.</p> 
    
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">By contrast, the broad smile would make us happy in real life, but feel underwhelming in the movie.</p>
        </div>
        
<p>
    Similarly, we may find the smile below to be appealing <callback>(attractive, glamorous, magical, romantic, and so on)</callback> in a <term>movie</term>, but would be a bit disturbing in <em>real life</em>:
</p>

        <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-02-movie-profiles/11-02-1-knightly-love-look.png"

title="Pretending realistic humor contorts our face"
alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 33rem ; margin-left: "

<p>We can try making this smile in a mirror, and imagine how people would react to us smiling at them like this! Even so, in the context of the spectator entertainment, it's enjoyable.</p>
                                                                  
<p>That's because spectator entertainment often inverts what's enjoyable in real life&mdash;a smirk is fun in a movie <callback>(and annoying in real life)</callback>, just like a carefully composed half-smile is charming in a movie <callback>(and a bit unsettling in real life)</callback>.             
  
    
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            
            <p class="considertext">This is obvious when we take pictures for social media or for business websites. What is appealing to <term>look at</term> doesn't always feel natural to <em>take</em>.</p> 
            
            <p class="considertext">However, like in any spectator entertainment, we are goal-oriented. We are prioritizing how the <term>audience</term> feels <term>looking</term> at our picture over how <em>we</em> feel <em>taking</em> the picture.</p>
            </div>         
           
          

            
<h2>Movies prioritize their own goals</h2>
      
   <div class="h2"> 
       
 <p>Movies&mdash;or any spectator entertainment&mdash;design their presentation of humor for the emotional ends of their audience. We can see this in a movie like <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title>:</p>
       
               <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-02-movie-profiles/11-02-2-storytelling-goals.png"

title="Pretending realistic humor contorts our face"
alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 23rem ; margin-left: "
>

       
<p>Early in the movie, the actor pretends more realistic humor in order to:</p>
        
<ul class="close-list">
       <li>make Jane feel relatable</li>
       <li>establish Jane's ease and freedom with laughing</li>
        <li>to show her close connection to her sister</li>
        <li>contrast with the formal and awkward Mr. Darcy</li>
        <li>set her emotional baseline for the rest of the story to measure against</li>
        </ul>
            
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
<p>At the conclusion, when Jane and Mr. Darcy share smiles, the production team has the actor linger in the shot with an unrealistic smile in order to:</p>
   
    <ul class="close-list">   
        <li>let the audience take in the actor's face</li>
        <li>draw out an emotional note for pacing</li>
        <li>support the soundtrack</li>
        <li>complete an arc toward a mature happiness</li>
        <li>move the story toward a happily-ever-after conclusion</li>
        <li>better match the character's  emotional cadence to show closeness</li>
                  </ul>
       
       <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
        <p>The creators of this movie didn't just tell the actor to smile and laugh. Instead, they told her to smile and laugh in specific ways that harmonized with  overall goals.</p>
        
        
         
         
          </div>              
    
  
<p>All of these factors shape spectator humor profiles in movies&mdash;how humor is or isn't pretended in movies.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Movies are straightforward examples of spectator entertainment. But we can use movies as a baseline to see how this is something we encounter <sem-weak>everywhere</sem-weak>:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="margin-left: 1rem;">
   <li>the profile pictures of our friends</li>
   <li>creators of video essays</li>
   <li>speakers for motivational events</li>
   <li>teachers giving an energetic lecture
       </li> 
       <li>  celebrities having photo shoots
             </li>   <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="considertext">Spectator humor profiles and personal humor profiles tend to blur or interplay with each other in these cases.</p>
    </div>


<div class="box">
     <p><headline>Faults.</headline> 
     There's nothing wrong with movies for using spectator humor profiles&mdash;for the same reason  there's nothing wrong with portraits using paint.</p>
     
     <p>Instead, <sem-weak>we</sem-weak> can be wrong if we start thinking that spectator entertainment is a supposed to be a straightforward mirror to real life.</p> 
     
     <p>If a movie doesn't claim to be emotionally realistic, then criticizing them for being unrealistic can speak worse of the critic than the movie&mdash;a bit like criticizing <book-title>Star Wars</book-title> for its depiction of technology.</p> 
     
     <p>For the same reason, thinking a movie like <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title> accurately depicts how people in love smile at each other can lead strange expectations&mdash;a bit like expecting warfare in space to look like <book-title>Star Wars</book-title>.</p> 
      
      <p>We can relate positively or negatively to spectator entertainment while <sem-weak>at the same time</sem-weak> knowing it's not intended as a straightforward mirror to reality.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <p>When choosing our senior photo, we don't usually chose the photo that <term>felt</term> best being taken&mdash;but the one that <em>looked </em>best, to spectators.</p>
          
        <p>A picture of us beaming and sitting with friends on a ratty couch may capture us at our interpersonal best&mdash;but it doesn't prioritize the goals of senior photo.</p> 
        
        <p>That's why we we probably took a stilted photo of us in ways we'd never behave in real life&mdash;maybe with a contorted torso and arms crossed in ways that felt awkward but looked good <sem-weak>for a picture</sem-weak>.</p>
        
    <p>Movies and shows are essentially like this always, where they always present humor in a way that looks good on camera but that would be very odd in real life.</p>
