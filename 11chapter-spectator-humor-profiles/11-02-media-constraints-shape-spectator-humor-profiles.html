Spectator humor profiles are shaped by constraints 
</h1>
   <p>There are a few reason live actors use spectator humor profiles:</p>
   
   <h2>We can't act out humor</h2>
   
<div class="h2">
  
  <p>There's a physical limitation&mdash;most actors can’t convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command!</p> 
   
   <div class="consider">
      <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">If we watch a video of our friend doubled over with laughter, and then are asked to perfectly imitate our friend's laughter&mdash;we can't!</p>
       </div>
    
    <p>This means we'll adjust how we pretend to have humor to what we're physically capable of doing.</p>
</div>
    

<h2>Real humor takes too long</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>For pacing reasons, most movies don't want realistic durations of humor.</p> 
    
<div class="consider"> 
           <p class="consider">Consider:</p>   
            <p class="considertext">When we laugh in conversation, the laughter may take up a 25% of the conversation&mdash;but most movies don't want 25% of a scene to be taken up by laughing! </p>
        </div>    

<p>This means we'll adjust how we pretend to have humor to fit wider objectives around pacing.</p>

</div>

<div class="content-example">

<p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds long—10% of the scene!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/si7-GBpm1vU?si=na9oDKeH7bRVebC8&amp;start=72&amp;end=96;" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>

<h2>Humor changes how we look</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we give genuine smiles, our skin crinkles, our lips rise toward our nose, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on. These can go against a movie's stylistic goals.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">Some movies rarely lets actors or characters <sem-weak>blink</sem-weak> on screen, let alone scrunch their eyes when they smile. These movies are making a choice to subordinate realism for a stylistic effect.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>This means we'll pretend to have humor in a way that also fits certain aesthetic goals.</p>
    
</div>


<h2>What's appealing gets scrambled</h2>
<div class="h2">
       
       <p>In real life, we find genuine, broad smiles appealing. But that doesn't mean we feel the same way about people giving broad smiles in spectator entertainment.</p>
        
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
                <p class="considertext">We can immediately tell which picture is of the actor's <term>spectator</term> humor profile, and which is the actor's <em>interpersonal</em> humor profile. But what we'd prefer to see in a movie and what we'd prefer to see in real life aren't always aligned: </p>

                title=""
                alt=""
                style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: "
                >
            
                  
                <p class="considertext">If we were talking to this man at a bus stop, we'd prefer he give an interpersonal  smile—since his smile would show he's feeling <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
            </div>                
            
        <p>That means we'll pretend to have humor in a way that audiences expect and enjoy to see when watching a surreal movie. </p> 
            
       </div>


<p>All of these factors shape spectator humor profiles&mdash;the humor tells we do or don't see in movies.</p>

<div class="box">
     <p><headline>Faults.</headline> It's not a criticism to point out that movies don't mirror emotions perfectly. That's because the priority of a movie is the emotional <term>response</term> of the audience, not emotional <em>realism</em> for its own sake. If we like the scoundrel character, it doesn't matter if their smirk isn't realistic.</p>
     
      <p>This is obvious in other cases, like when people think it's a criticism to point out something unscientific in a movie. <callback>("You can't hear noises in space, so that made it a bad movie.")</callback> That's because the goal of most movies is the emotional <term>response</term> of the audience, not <em>realism</em> for realism's sake. <callback>("That space battle was heartpounding!")</callback></p> 
    
 
     <p>In general, we criticize movies when the emotional handling feels off, not when the realism feels off&mdash;since the realism is often neither here nor there.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <p>When choosing our senior photo, we don't usually chose the photo that <term>felt</term> best being taken&mdash;but the one that <em>looked </em>best, to spectators.</p>
          
        <p>A picture of us beaming and sitting with friends on a ratty couch may capture us at our interpersonal best&mdash;but it doesn't prioritize the goals of senior photo.</p> 
        
        <p>That's why we we probably took a stilted photo of us in ways we'd never behave in real life&mdash;maybe with a contorted torso and arms crossed in ways that felt awkward but looked good <sem-weak>for a picture</sem-weak>.</p>
        
    <p>Movies and shows are essentially like this always, where they always present humor in a way that looks good on camera but that would be very odd in real life.</p>
