Constraints on representation
</h1>
   <p>There are a few reason spectator humor profiles are the way they are for live actors:</p>
   
   <h2>We can't act out humor</h2>
   
<div class="h2">
  
  <p>There's a physical limitation&mdash;we can’t convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command!</p> 
  
     <div class="consider">
      <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">If we watch a video of our friend doubled over with laughter, and then are asked to perfectly imitate our friend's laughter&mdash;we can't!</p>
       </div>
  
      <p>This means actors will adjust how they pretend to have humor to what they're physically capable of doing.</p> 
      
          <p>This is supported by directors and screenwriters, who won't ask their actors to do what they can't do well.</p>
    
   

    

</div>
    

<h2>Real humor takes too long</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>For pacing reasons, most movies don't want realistic durations of humor.</p> 
    
<div class="consider"> 
           <p class="consider">Consider:</p>   
            <p class="considertext">When we laugh in conversation, the laughter may take up a 25% of the conversation&mdash;but most movies don't want 25% of a scene to be taken up by laughing.</p>
        </div>    

<p>This means actors, screenwriters, directors, and editors will adjust how humor is pretended to fit wider objectives around pacing.</p>

<div class="content-example">

<p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds long—10% of the scene!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/si7-GBpm1vU?si=na9oDKeH7bRVebC8&amp;start=72&amp;end=96;" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>

<h2>Humor changes how we look</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we give genuine smiles, our skin crinkles, our lips rise toward our nose, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on. These can go against a variety of goals in a movie.</p>

    <p>In this still, we can see how pretending more realistic humor contorts this actor's face:</p> 
            
    <p>The style of many movies are for very smooth faces&mdash;which often seem standard and correct to us when seen on film.</p>
            
<div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">Some movies rarely lets actors or characters <sem-weak>blink</sem-weak> on screen, let alone scrunch their eyes when they smile. These movies are making a stylistic choice&mdash; because the goal isn't realism for realism's sake.</p>
    </div>
    
       
        
</div>



<h2>What's appealing gets scrambled</h2>
<div class="h2">
       
       <p>What we'd prefer to see in a movie and what we'd prefer to see in real life aren't always aligned: </p>
                
                <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-00-spectator-humor-profiles/11-0-3-han-solo-2.png"
                
                title="Normalcy"
                alt="On the left is an actor smirking rogueishly for the camera. On the right, the same actor smiles normally. An annotation says that the normal smile looks goofy on a camera (even though it would look normal in conversation), while the acted smile looks good on camera (even though it would be offputting in conversation)."
                style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: "
                >
            
                  
    <p>If someone smirked as they recieved an award in real life, we'd find it off-putting. If they gave a broad smile instead, we'd be pleased and happy for them.</p> 
       
<p>But this can be inverted in movies&mdash;we'd <term>enjoy</term> the characterization of the smirk, and be <em>nonplussed</em> by a normal broad smile.</p> 
        
<p>
    Similarly, in a movie we may find the smile in the still below to be appealing <callback>(attractive, glamorous, magical, romantic, and so on)</callback>:
</p>
        
<p>
  Of course, if we tried to smile like this to our partner, with eyes unnaturally open&mdash;we'd probably freak them out! There's this inversion between what's appealing in real life and in spectator entertainment.
</p>
    
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            
            <p class="considertext">This is obvious when we take pictures for social media or for professional shots. What is appealing to look at doesn't always feel natural to take.</p> 
            
            <p class="considertext"> We are creating spectator entertainment&mdash;we are prioritizing how the <term>audience</term> feels watching over how <em>we</em> feel taking the picture.</p>
            </div>         
           
          
          <p>we were talking to this man at an event, we'd prefer he'd give an interpersonal  smile—since his smile would show he's feeling <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on.</p> 
           
<p>Of course, watching a movie isn't the same thing as meeting someone at an event&mdash;which leads to spectater entertainment having a diverging humor profile.</p> 
            </div>  
            
<h2>Movies prioritize their own goals</h2>
      
   <div class="h2"> 
       
 <p>Movies&mdash;or any spectator entertainment&mdash;design their presentation of humor to fit their goals.</p>

<p>In <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title>, the humor is part of the storytelling. The movie has Jane pretend more realistic humor early on in order to:</p>
        
<ul class="close-list">
       <li>to make her feel relatable</li>
        <li>to show her connection to her sister</li>
        <li>contrast with the formal and awkward Mr. Darcy</li>
        <li>to create a baseline for the audience to measure later emotional changes against</li>
        </ul>
            
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
<p>At the conclusion, Jane and Mr. Darcy share smiles and Jane has an unrealistic smile in order to:</p>
    <ul class="close-list">   
        <li>make her look conventionally pretty to spectators</li>
<li>complete an arc toward maturity</li>
        <li>settle towards a happily-ever-after tone</li>
        <li>closer match to Mr. Darcy's emotional cadence</li>
                  </ul>
       
       <p class="and-so-on">and so on</p>
    
        <p>The creators of this movie made choices for Jane's presentation of humor for reasons beyond realism for realism's sake.</p>
        
         
          </div>              
    
  
<p>All of these factors shape spectator humor profiles&mdash;the humor tells we do or don't see in movies.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We looked at movies, which are straightforward examples of spectator entertainment. But we can use movies as a baseline to see how this is something we encounter <sem-weak>everywhere</sem-weak>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This includes the profile pictures of our friends, creators of video essays, speakers for motivational events, teachers giving an energetic lecture, celebrities having photo shoots, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">These are often emotionally-mixed things, where spectator humor profiles and personal humor profiles blur or interplay with each other.</p>
    </div>


<div class="box">
     <p><headline>Faults.</headline> 
     There's nothing wrong with movies for using spectator humor profiles&mdash;any more than there's something wrong with portraits using paint.</p>
     
     <p>Instead, <sem-weak>we</sem-weak> can be wrong if we start confusing spectator entertainment as being a straightforward mirror to real life.</p> 
     
     <p>This can lead to odd criticisms of spectator entertainment <callback>(like saying it's emotionally unrealistic even though that was never the goal)</callback> or odd expectations of the world around us (<callback>like assuming <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title> accurately depicts how people in love smile at each other)</callback>.</p> 
     
     
 



</div>


<!--
    <div class="box">
        <p>When choosing our senior photo, we don't usually chose the photo that <term>felt</term> best being taken&mdash;but the one that <em>looked </em>best, to spectators.</p>
          
        <p>A picture of us beaming and sitting with friends on a ratty couch may capture us at our interpersonal best&mdash;but it doesn't prioritize the goals of senior photo.</p> 
        
        <p>That's why we we probably took a stilted photo of us in ways we'd never behave in real life&mdash;maybe with a contorted torso and arms crossed in ways that felt awkward but looked good <sem-weak>for a picture</sem-weak>.</p>
        
    <p>Movies and shows are essentially like this always, where they always present humor in a way that looks good on camera but that would be very odd in real life.</p>
