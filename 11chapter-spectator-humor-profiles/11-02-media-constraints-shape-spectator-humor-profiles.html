Constraints on representation
</h1>
  
<p>
  
<p>Spectator humor profiles are shaped by physical limitations <callback>(actors can't convincingly produce high-intensity humor on demand)</callback>&mdash;but there's more shaping how humor is conveyed in movies.</p>

<h2>Some humor tells interfere with camera shots</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>If a movie wants a clear shot of a face, the director will instruct the actor not to put their hands near their heads when pretending to laugh. This prevents a common humor tell from being represented in many movies.</p>
</div>

<h2>Real humor takes too long</h2>

<div class="h2">
    
<p>When we laugh in conversation, the laughter may take up 25% of the conversation&mdash;but for pacing reasons, movies don't want laughter to take up 25% of a scene! This shapes how actors, screenwriters, directors, and editors portray humor.</p>

<div class="content-example">

<p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds longâ€”10% of the scene!</p>

<p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>

<h2>Humor changes how we look</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we give genuine smiles, our skin crinkles, our lips rise toward our nose, our nose moves, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on:</p>

alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 35rem ; margin-left: "
>
    
 <p>Some movies rarely let actors or characters <sem-weak>blink</sem-weak> on screen, let alone scrunch their eyes when they smile. These stylistic choices are made with an audience in mind.</p>


    
       
        
</div>



<h2>What's appealing gets scrambled</h2>
<div class="h2">
       
   
           <p>In a <term>movie</term>, it's charming to see the roguish character smirk as they recieve an award&mdash;but it would be off-putting in <em>real life</em>:</p> 
 
                <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-02-constraints/11-02-1-han-solo-2.png"
                
                title="Normalcy"
                alt="On the left is an actor smirking rogueishly for the camera. On the right, the same actor smiles normally. An annotation says that the normal smile looks goofy on a camera (even though it would look normal in conversation), while the acted smile looks good on camera (even though it would be offputting in conversation)."
                style="max-width: 35rem; margin-left: "
                >
            
               
   

    

<p>
    Similarly, we may find the smile below to be appealing <callback>(attractive, glamorous, magical, romantic, and so on)</callback> in a <term>movie</term>, but it would be a bit disturbing to see in <em>real life</em>:

title="Pretending realistic humor contorts our face"
alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 33rem ; margin-left: "
>


<p>We can try making this tight smile with eyes wide open in a mirror&mdash;and then imagine how people would react to us smiling at them like this!</p>
    
<p>That's because what we enjoy is often inverted between spectator entertainment and real life. A smirk is fun in a movie <callback>(but infuriating in real life)</callback>, just like an open-eyed, tight smile is nice in a movie <callback>(but unsettling in real life)</callback>.</p>  
    
    
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            
    <p class="considertext">This is obvious when we take pictures that are successful on social media or for business websites. What's an appealing photo for others to <term>look at</term> doesn't always feel natural to <em>take</em>.</p> 
           
 
            
    <p class="considertext">           
           But because we're spectator-oriented, we prioritize how the <term>audience</term> feels <term>looking</term> at our picture over how <em>we</em> feel <em>taking</em> the picture. This is essentially how actors feel when representing humor.</p>
            </div>         
           
          

<!--            
<h2>Movies prioritize their own goals</h2>
      
   <div class="h2"> 
       
 <p>Movies make choices prioritizing their audience&mdash;and so how humor is pretended is in service of a variety of other goals other than realism for realism's sake.</p>
      
      <p>We can see this in a movie like <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title>:</p>
       
               <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-02-movie-profiles/11-02-2-storytelling-goals.png"

title="Pretending realistic humor contorts our face"
alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 23rem ; margin-left: "
>

       
<p>Early in the movie, the actor pretends more realistic humor in order to:</p>
        
<ul class="close-list">
       <li>make Jane feel relatable</li>
       <li>establish Jane's ease and freedom with laughing</li>
        <li>to show her close connection to her sister</li>
        <li>contrast with the formal and awkward Mr. Darcy</li>
        <li>set her emotional baseline for the rest of the story to measure against</li>
        </ul>
            
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
<p>At the conclusion, when Jane and Mr. Darcy share smiles, the production team has the actor linger in the shot with an unrealistic smile in order to:</p>
   
    <ul class="close-list">   
        <li>let the audience take in the actor's face</li>
        <li>draw out an emotional note for pacing</li>
        <li>support the soundtrack</li>
        <li>complete an arc toward a mature happiness</li>
        <li>move the story toward a happily-ever-after conclusion</li>
        <li>better match the character's  emotional cadence to show closeness</li>
                  </ul>
       
       <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
        <p>The creators of this movie didn't just tell the actor to smile and laugh. Instead, they told her to smile and laugh in specific ways that harmonized with  overall goals.</p>
        
        
         
         
          </div>              
    -->
  
<p>These are examples of how constraints and goals lead to a distinctive "movie"  humor profile.</p>




<!--
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Movies are straightforward examples of spectator entertainment. But we can use movies as a baseline to see how this is something we encounter <sem-weak>everywhere</sem-weak>, including the:</p>
    
<ul class="close-list" style="margin-left: 1rem;">
   <li>the profile pictures of our friends</li>
   <li>creators of video essays</li>

    <p class="considertext">Spectator humor profiles and personal humor profiles tend to blur or interplay with each other in these cases.</p>

     There's nothing wrong with <term>movies</term>  using <term>spectator humor profiles</term>&mdash;for the same reason there's nothing wrong with <em>portraits</em> using <em>paint</em>.</p>
         
     <p>If we think movies are "supposed" to be emotionally realistic, we can invent a goalpost for criticism&mdash;or else draw off-base conclusions about how people behave.</p>

    <p><book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title> isn't trying to document how people in love look at each other, any more than <book-title>Star Wars</book-title> is trying to predict what space warfare will be like.</p>
    
    <p>That's okay, because <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title> isn't trying to be emotionally realistic any more than <book-title>Star Wars</book-title> is trying to be scientifically accurate.</p>
        
        <p>As movies, they are engaging their audience&mdash;and aren't straightforward mirrors of life. </p>

    <div class="box">
        <p>When choosing our senior photo, we don't usually chose the photo that <term>felt</term> best being taken&mdash;but the one that <em>looked </em>best, to spectators.</p>
          
        <p>A picture of us beaming and sitting with friends on a ratty couch may capture us at our interpersonal best&mdash;but it doesn't prioritize the goals of senior photo.</p> 
        
        <p>That's why we we probably took a stilted photo of us in ways we'd never behave in real life&mdash;maybe with a contorted torso and arms crossed in ways that felt awkward but looked good <sem-weak>for a picture</sem-weak>.</p>
        
    <p>Movies and shows are essentially like this always, where they always present humor in a way that looks good on camera but that would be very odd in real life.</p>
