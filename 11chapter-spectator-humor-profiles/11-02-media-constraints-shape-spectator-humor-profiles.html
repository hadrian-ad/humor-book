Constraints on representation
</h1>

<p>

<p>Sometimes we think movies are <sem-weak>supposed</sem-weak> to show realistic humor&mdash;but movies aren't trying to be realistic for realism's sake.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
     
    <p class="for-instance-text">It's obvious that <book-title>Star Wars</book-title> isn't trying to present realistic <term>space battles</term> for realism's sake&mdash;realism isn't the priority!</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">For exactly the same reason, movies aren't trying to present realistic <em>emotions</em> for realism's sake&mdash;realism also isn't the priority.</p>

</div>

<p>When a movie is made, a variety of goals will have to be balenced&mdash;shaping how actors, screenwriters, directors, and editors portray humor. Instead of prioritizing realism, they may:</p>

<ul>
     
       <li><sem>Prioritize pacing.</sem> When we laugh in conversation, the laughter may take up a susbtantial proportion of the conversation. But for pacing reasons, movies don't want laughter to take up the same proportion of a scene.</li>
     
     <li><sem>Prioritize camera shots.</sem>
      If a movie wants a clear shot of a face, the director will instruct the actor not to put their hands near their heads when pretending to laugh. This prevents a common humor tell from being present in many scenes:</li>

    <p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds longâ€”10% of the scene!</p>

    <p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>

      <sem>Prioritize what's flattering on camera.</sem> Genuine smiles contort our faces. Some movies rarely let actors or characters <sem-weak>blink</sem-weak> on screen, let alone scrunch their eyes when they smile. Movies often avoid normal humor tells as a stylistic choice:</li>

      >        
     
    <li><sem>Prioritize storytelling.</sem> As we watch a movie, we may register a smile as fitting the themes, character arcs, music, romance, and so on. But when we imagine many movie smiles happening in <em>real life</em>, they can seem odd:</li>

    </ul>

   
   
   <p>All these priorities shape how humor is presented in spectator entertainment. Spectator entertainment will selectively use or modify humor tells in a way that creates spectator humor profiles.</p> 
   
   <div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">There's nothing wrong with <term>movies</term>  using <term>spectator humor profiles</term>&mdash;for the same reason there's nothing wrong with <em>portraits</em> using <em>paint</em>. Without paint, it wouldn't be a painting!    
    </p>
  
       <p class="considertext">Instead, <sem-weak>we</sem-weak> can be wrong if we assume that movies are straightforward mirrors of real life. Movies have constraints and goals that aren't simply realism for realism's sake.</p>
  
                 </div> 
  
  
  
  
  
<div class="box"><p><headline>Limitations.</headline> One reason spectator humor profiles are so distinct is that we simply can't convincingly act out medium-intensity humor or higher on command!</p>
     
<p>We can't convincingly act out our <term>own</term> laugh on command&mdash;let alone imitate someone <em>else's</em> laughter. While we can sometimes caricature, we can't convincingly replicate intense laughter.</p> 
     
<p>Directors and actors will shape presentations of humor to what is physically possible to do. If a lead actor can't act out laughter, it won't be scripted. We don't always notice this about movies, once it's pointed out it's hard to unsee!</p>

  <!--
    <p class="considertext">That's because what we enjoy is often inverted between spectator entertainment and real life.

<h2>Movies prioritize their own goals</h2>
    
 <div class="h2"> 
     
 <p>Movies make choices prioritizing their audience&mdash;and so how humor is pretended is in service of a variety of other goals other than realism for realism's sake.</p>
    
    <p>We can see this in a movie like <book-title>Pride and Prejudice</book-title>:</p>
     
             <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-02-movie-profiles/11-02-2-storytelling-goals.png"

title="Pretending realistic humor contorts our face"
alt="This photo is a still from a Pride and Prejudice movie. Jane laughs with her sister, and her eyes are squinting, nose scrunched, mouth open."
style="max-width: 23rem ; margin-left: "
>

     
<p>Early in the movie, the actor pretends more realistic humor in order to:</p>
      
<ul class="close-list">
     <li>make Jane feel relatable</li>
     <li>establish Jane's ease and freedom with laughing</li>
      <li>to show her close connection to her sister</li>
      <li>contrast with the formal and awkward Mr. Darcy</li>
      <li>set her emotional baseline for the rest of the story to measure against</li>
      </ul>
          
  <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
  
<p>At the conclusion, when Jane and Mr. Darcy share smiles, the production team has the actor linger in the shot with an unrealistic smile in order to:</p>
 
  <ul class="close-list">   
      <li>let the audience take in the actor's face</li>
      <li>draw out an emotional note for pacing</li>
      <li>support the soundtrack</li>
      <li>complete an arc toward a mature happiness</li>
      <li>move the story toward a happily-ever-after conclusion</li>
      <li>better match the character's  emotional cadence to show closeness</li>
                </ul>
     
     <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
  
      <p>The creators of this movie didn't just tell the actor to smile and laugh. Instead, they told her to smile and laugh in specific ways that harmonized with  overall goals.</p>

      <p>When choosing our senior photo, we don't usually chose the photo that <term>felt</term> best being taken&mdash;but the one that <em>looked </em>best, to spectators.</p>
        
      <p>A picture of us beaming and sitting with friends on a ratty couch may capture us at our interpersonal best&mdash;but it doesn't prioritize the goals of senior photo.</p> 
      
      <p>That's why we we probably took a stilted photo of us in ways we'd never behave in real life&mdash;maybe with a contorted torso and arms crossed in ways that felt awkward but looked good <sem-weak>for a picture</sem-weak>.</p>
      
  <p>Movies and shows are essentially like this always, where they always present humor in a way that looks good on camera but that would be very odd in real life.</p>
