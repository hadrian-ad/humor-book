The presence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>Sometimes the absence of humor is surreal, but other times the presence of humor is surreal. This is often most noticeable in advertisements or corporate videos:</p>

<p>For instance, the smile made by the air steward is surreal—it’s uncomfortable to show teeth for very long and to not adjust our smiles. It’s not something people do in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">If we don't read manga, their spectator humor profiles can seem odd at first. But eventually, it seems completely normal. The same thing happens with humor tells in advertisements! We're so used to these spectator humor profiles that the don't strike us as unusual or surreal—until we stop to look at them.
        </p>    
    
    
 <p class="considertext">   To feel how surreal these smiles are, we can look in the mirror and practice imitating the air steward's smile—and then try holding that smile for a friend and see if it passes as a normal smile.</p>
    </div>

<p>Similarly, we can spot surrealness in the advertisement below by asking: <i>“who is the women in the sewing machine advertisement smiling at?” </i>The answer is simultaneously no one and everyone—it’s surreal!</p>

<p>Emotional surrealism is often enjoyable or effective—there’s nothing inherently wrong or right about it. But it can become a problem if we start thinking that emotionally surreal things reflect the world more straightforwardly than they really do.</p>

    <p>There are many surreal elements to this advertisement—like at the end, when the actor takes a distant sniff of her shoes while pretending to hold a phone or camera, with the editors adding a sound effect (a sigh of delight). Then the actor looks at the camera she's pretending to hold, and smiles. The editors add in a giggle as a sound effect. </p>

<p>Differnt surreal things have different reasons they can't present humor the way humans do. To adapt to this, these surreal things use their own internal system of humor tells. These many internal systems are "spectator humor profiles."</p>

<ul>
   <li>Humor tells in spectator entertainment are surreal. When we get used to these spectator humor profiles, they seem normal—but they're not "real."</li> 
    
   <li>Spectator entertainment is often designed for desynchronized emotions. The characters feel one thing, the spectators feel another.</li> 
    
    <li>Both the absence and the presence of humor can be surreal—the humor doesn't occur where it would in real life, and does occur where it wouldn't.</li>
