The presence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>Sometimes the absence of humor is surreal, but other times the presence of humor is surreal. This is often most noticeable in advertisements or corporate videos:</p>

<p>For instance, the smile made by the air steward is surreal—it’s uncomfortable to show teeth for very long and to not adjust our smiles. It’s not something people do in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">If we don't read manga, their spectator humor profiles can seem odd at first. But eventually, it seems completely normal. The same thing happens with humor tells in advertisements! We're so used to these spectator humor profiles that the don't strike us as unusual or surreal—until we stop to look at them.
        </p>    
    
    
 <p class="considertext">   To feel how surreal these smiles are, we can look in the mirror and practice imitating the air steward's smile—and then try holding that smile for a friend and see if it passes as a normal smile.</p>
    </div>

<p>Similarly, we can spot surrealness in the advertisement below by asking: <i>“who is the women in the sewing machine advertisement smiling at?” </i>The answer is simultaneously no one and everyone—it’s surreal!</p>

<p>Emotional surrealism is often enjoyable or effective—there’s nothing inherently wrong or right about it. But it can become a problem if we start thinking that emotionally surreal things reflect the world more straightforwardly than they really do.</p>


That's the end of this chapter! Well done.

Next, we'll look at emotion networks!

 
More examples. For additional examples, see this chapter's appendix.
End of chapter summary: In surreal things, we have ways of representing people or things as expressing humor. These "spectator humor profiles" aren't necessarily similar to humor profiles. 

It's hard to convincingly act laughter and other humor tells—and it's impossible in many mediums to use realistic humor tells. 
In spectator entertainment, the emotions of the characters and spectators aren't usually synchronized in spectator entertainment. 
Both the absence and the presence of humor can be surreal in spectator entertainment.
