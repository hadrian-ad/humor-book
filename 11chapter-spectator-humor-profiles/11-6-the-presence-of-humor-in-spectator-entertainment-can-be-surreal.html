The presence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>Sometimes the <term>absence</term> of humor is surreal, but other times the <em>presence</em> of humor is surreal. This is often most noticeable in advertisements or corporate videos:</p>

<p>For instance, the smile made by the air steward is surreal—it’s uncomfortable to show teeth for very long and to not adjust our smiles. It’s not something people do in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">If we don't read manga, the spectator humor profiles they use can seem odd at first. But eventually, it seems completely normal.</p> 
       
       <p class="considertext">The same thing happens with humor tells in advertisements! We're so used to these spectator humor profiles that the don't strike us as unusual or surreal—until we stop to look at them, and realize how weird they are.
        </p>    
    
    
 <p class="considertext">   To feel how surreal these advertising smiles are, we can look in the mirror and practice imitating the air steward's smile—and then try holding that smile for a friend and see if it passes as a normal smile.</p>
    </div>

<p>Similarly, we can spot surrealness in the advertisement below by asking: <i>“who is the women in the sewing machine advertisement smiling at?” </i>The answer is simultaneously no one and everyone—it’s surreal!</p>

<p>Emotional surrealism is often enjoyable or effective—there’s nothing inherently wrong or right about it. But it can become a problem if we start thinking that emotionally surreal things reflect the world more straightforwardly than they really do.</p>

    <p>There are many surreal elements to this advertisement—like at the end, when the actor takes a distant sniff of her shoes while pretending to hold a camera or phone, with the editors adding a sound effect (a sigh of delight). Then the actor looks at the camera she's pretending to hold, and smiles. The editors add in a giggle as a sound effect. </p>

<p>When we produce things for an emotional effect, the medium confers constraints. One way we adapt to these constraints is by giving them their own internal pattern of humor tells. These various internal patterns are "spectator humor profiles."</p>

<ul>
   <li>When we get used to <a href="11-0-spectator-humor-profiles.html">spectator humor profiles</a>, they seem normal&mdash;but normal is different than "real." The humor tells in spectator entertainment are surreal&mdash;they're not meant to be a perfect mirror of our lives.</li> 
    
   <li>Spectator entertainment often takes advantage of <a href="11-4-spectators-and-spectator-characters-are-usually-desynchronized.html">desynchronized evaluations</a>. The characters feel one thing, the spectators feel another. This creates the gap that allows for divergent situations and evaluations, like laughing when a character gets hit by a bus.</li> 
    
    <li>Both the <a href="11-6-the-presence-of-humor-in-spectator-entertainment-can-be-surreal.html">absence and the presence</a> of humor in spectator entertainment can be surreal—the humor doesn't always occur where it would in real life, and sometimes occurs where it wouldn't.</li>
