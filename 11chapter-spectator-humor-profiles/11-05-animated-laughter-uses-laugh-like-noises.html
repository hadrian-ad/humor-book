Animation can make many noises seem like laughter
</h1>


<p>While <term>live-action</term> spectator entertainment doesn't often have memorable laughs, <em>animated</em> spectator entertainment often does.</p>


    <p>For instance, most of the characters in <i>The Simpsons</i> have distinctive laughs. If we’re familiar with the show, we can propably recall how most of the cast laughs:</p>

          <ul class="close-list" style=margin-left:1.5rem;>
           <li>Marge has a nasal <callback>“Hm!hmhmhm”</callback></li>
            <li>Homer has a hearty <callback>“BWAH!ha-ha-ha-ha!”</callback></li>
            <li>Bart has a troublemaker’s <callback>“eh heh heh hah ha”</callback></li>
            <li>Lisa has a snacking <callback>“hheh hheeh haw haw.”</callback></li> 
            </ul>         
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>By contrast, our favorite live action shows probably has less laughing overall, and fewer distinctive laughs.</p>

    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
             
    <p class="considertext">Even though we interpret characters in animated spectator entertainment as <term>laughing</term>, the actors are more often than not just making <em>noises</em>. Many repetitive noises will be interpreted as laughter when superimposed over cartoon animations of laughter.</p> 
       
    <p class="considertext">This is why we can remember so many distinctive laugh-like noises for animated characters&mdash;voice actors have practical leeway to create distinctive vocal characetrizations for their characters. All without worrying about how they look while making these laugh-like noises!</p>
 
</div>
         
         <p>We relate to characters with coherent, vivid spectator humor profiles. This is one reason we 
         
         often find characters in animated comedies to be emotionally responsive and relatable&mdash;while sitcom characters often feel flat by comparison.</p>

                  In fact, "real" laughing can look odd when superimposed over some animations

<p>We interpret the repetitive noises the voice actor is making as laughter—but it's not actually laughing, just repetitive random noises! (We can see this for ourselves by imitating Frink's laughter.)</p>

<p>In fact, almost any kind of repetitive noise we make could be superimposed over an animated character laughing, and be interpreted by others as laughing—even though it's actually just a random repetitive noise!</p>

<p>This kind of shared laughter is relatively harder to do well in live shows than animated shows. Voice actors have more leeway to establish memorable noises for their characters' laughs, which they can then do consistently. These laughs are often one of our strongest point of recall for them.</p>


<p>The presence of nuanced and varied laugh-like noises gives animated shows a feeling of emotional finesse and relatability that's often lacking in film.</p>

<p>For instance, in this clip two characters who were at first testy rivals have been forced to collaborate and develop mutual respect for each other. With a larger OK and understanding of each other, they share faults that generate large mistakes&mdash;generating humor. They feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>forgiveness</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on.</p>

<p>Since animated shows have an easier time displaying intensity, duration, and lean toward mistake-predominance or OK-predominance, we experience them as having emotional depth. A live action show would struggle to convincingly display intense humor like this, making the emotional activity feel flat. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Example #2 (Film):</button>
   
   <div class="content-example">

<p>We find distinctive spectator laughs to be memorable and relatable, whether in film or animation. In this clip one character has a memorable, non-standard spectator laugh, while the other has a forgettable, standard spectator laugh:</p> 


<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NVXU6p2QaKU?si=S7DP0e7ojluw0AYg&amp;end=21" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>One one hand, the distinctive laugh is <term>familiar</term> to our lives, since we hear distinctive laughs like this relatively frequently. On the other hand, it's <em>unfamiliar</em> to movies, since we rarely hear laughs like this from main characters that aren't part of an explicit gag. In the end, the unusual laugh makes the character relatable and memorable.

<p><headline>Memorability.</headline> Some live-action characters have memorable humor tells, like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
        
        <li>Han Solo’s lopsided smile</li> 
        <li>Fox Mulder’s enthusiastic grin</li>
        <li>James Bond’s smirk</li> 
        <li>Harry Potter’s shy smile</li>
        <li>Jack Sparrow's half-of-face smile</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
 
<p>But even though these humor tells are <term>memorable</term>, they probably don't have memorable <em>laughs</em>—because it's hard to create a signature laugh for a live-action character, let alone do it convincingly on command.</p>

<p>We can find scenes of them laughing, but the sound of the laugh itself is often forgettable&mdash;a video version of a novel saying <callback>"he laughed."</callback></p>
  
  <p>We can compare this to Homer Simpson&mdash;who has an iconic laugh that fans would instantly recognize.</p> 
  
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
      <p class="considertext">This disparity in laughter is one reason live-action characters don't always translate well to animation and vice versa&mdash;a live actor for Homer would have to cut the laugh, while an animated Han Solo wouldn't have a laugh!</p>
