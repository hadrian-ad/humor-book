Pretend evaluations

<p>Last chapter, we tracked different evaluations for spectators, characters, and the actors playing those characters:</p>

<p>A spectator humor profile is how characters or other surreal things, like drawings or animations, show humor:</p>

<p>We don't always have to think about how actors have their own evaluations apart from their characters. In part, that's because movies or shows want to obscure actors' evaluations&mdash;and so they'll film or practice enough that the audience won't ever see the actors break character.</p> 

<p>But sometimes the contrast between the actor and their character is part of the fun of the entertainment:</p>



<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam is watching a comedian give fake names, but the comedian loses his composure and starts laughing. He turns red as he holds paper over his mouth to disguise his laughter.</narration> <notes>(&larr;we often track both actors and character emotions during live skits)</notes></p>

<p>An actor is playing a bombastic, prejudicial character. The <term>character's</term> evaluations toward the world are supposed to be mistake-predominant, while the <em>actor's</em> evaluations toward the puns are supposed to be OK-predominant.</p> 
  
  <p>But in this case, the <term>actor</term> feels humor toward the puns, and his evaluations break through his <em>character's</em> acted evaluations.</p>
