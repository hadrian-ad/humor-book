Distinquishing represented humor</h1>

        <!--
<p>Last chapter, we tracked different evaluations for spectators, characters, and the actors playing those characters:</p>

<p>When put side-by-side, it's often easy to distinquish between an actor <term>acting</term> humor  <callback>(spectator humor profile)</callback> and the actors own <em>feelings</em> of humor <callback>(personal humor profile)</callback>:</p>

alt="This image has two columns to compare spectator humor profiles and personal humor profiles. One the left, an actor smirks rogueishly (spectator humor profile). On the right, the same actor smiles between takes, which looks full and real(personal humor profile)."

<p><term>Pretended</term> evaluations are less vividly presented than our <em>actual</em> evaluations&mdash;which isn't unique to humor, but is true for all our emotions.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         
    <p class="considertext">We can usually distinquish between when someone is <term>pretending</term> to be surprised and when they are <em>actually</em> surprised.</p>
</div>

<p>Pretended humor tends to seem flat everywhere&mdash;whether in social situations or in movies!</p>


<div class="box"><p><headline>Limitations.</headline> Spectator humor profiles are partially the result of physical limitations&mdash;we simply can't convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command!</p>
     
<p>We can't convincingly do our <term>own</term> laugh on command&mdash;let alone imitate someone <em>else's</em> laughter. We can sometimes caricature, but not replicate intense laughter. </p> 
     
<p>Live action movies avoid asking their actors to do things they are incapable of doing&mdash;which leads to movies that are devoid of in-movie laughter. While we don't always notice this about movies, once it's pointed out it's hard to unsee!</p>
     
 
<!--
<div class="box">
   
<p><headline>Vividness.</headline> We often don't notice how flat humor is in movies until it's pointed out. Then it can be hard to unsee!</p>
   
<p>Often, we make judge humor in spectator entertainment relative to that piece of work. If we watch <book-title>Lord of the Rings</book-title>, the characters rarely feel humor&mdash;the series is coherent to this surreal premise.</p>
  
<p>That makes small smiles seem vivid <sem-weak>in that movie</sem-weak>&mdash;since they sharply contrast with the rest of the emotional premise:</p>
   
<div class="vignette"><p><narration>Trevor is watching <book-title>The Return of the King</book-title>.</narration></p>
    
     <p><speaker>Pippin:</speaker> <action>*leaning on balcony*</action> <internalaction>(worried)</internalaction> <speech>"Is there any hope for Frodo and Sam?"</speech></p>
      
      <p><speaker>Gandalf:</speaker> <action>*leans on balcony*</action> <speech>"There never was much hope."</speech> <action>*eyes twinkling*</action> <internalaction>(smiling)</internalaction> <speech>"Just a fool's hope."</speech></p>
           
    <p><speaker>Pippin</speaker>: <action>*small smile*</action> <notes>(&larr;Pippin feels low-intensity <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on)</notes>  </p>
            
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*thinking*</action> "God, I love Gandalf."</p>   
            </div> 
   
<p>Many of Trevor's favorite memories from that film are where Gandalf smiles or makes Trevor smile. This makes Trevor remember Gandalf as having vivid humor.</p>

<p>But it's worth seperating what's vivid <term>relative to the movie</term>&mdash;and how that actually compares relative <em>to our own lives</em>.</p>
