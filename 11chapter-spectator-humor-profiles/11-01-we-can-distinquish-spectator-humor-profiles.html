Pretend evaluations
</h1>

        <!--
<p>Last chapter, we tracked different evaluations for spectators, characters, and the actors playing those characters:</p>

   <p><narration>Jennifer and Sam concentrate on acting, as their characters act stand-offish. As Sam gets up on the table, the audience laughs.</narration></p>

<p>We can often easily distinquish between <term>pretended</term> humor  <callback>(spectator humor profile)</callback> and the actors own <em>feelings</em> of humor <callback>(personal humor profile)</callback>.</p>

<p>In part, that's because the humor we feel is so much more nuanced and vivid than the humor we can act out:</p>

<p>This isn't unique to humor. We can usually tell when someone is surprised by something or is just <sem-weak>pretending</sem-weak> to be surprised. It's the same for humor.</p>

<p>An actor is playing a bombastic, prejudicial character. The <term>character's</term> evaluations toward the world are supposed to be mistake-predominant, while the <em>actor's</em> evaluations toward the puns are supposed to be OK-predominant.</p> 
  
  <p>But in this case, the <term>actor</term> feels humor toward the puns, and his evaluations break through his <em>character's</em> acted evaluations.</p>
