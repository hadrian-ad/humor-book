11. Spectator humor profiles
</h1>


Last chapter we looked at spectator entertainment, and how we can think about our evaluations about surreal things. 

In this chapter, we’ll look at how spectator characters express humor—their “spectator humor profile.”

Consider:

We said before that each person has a humor profile. Our humor profile is how someone we express humor, specific to us. But if we act in a play, we won't transplant our actual humor profile to the stage wholesale—instead, we'll use a spectator humor profile. 

We can usually tell when it’s the character showing humor tells (spectator humor profile) and when it’s the actor showing humor tells (interpersonal humor profile)—in part because personal humor profiles are exponentially more vivid than spectator humor profiles:

Often, we don’t notice how artificial spectator humor profiles are until someone points them out—like how the actor above never tries to give his character realistic humor tells, even over a half-a-dozen films.

Actors and directors use spectator humor profiles for a few reasons:

Most actors can’t convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command. To accommodate this, movies will avoid scripting this intensity of humor

Actors and their characters are often in movies with a style of cinematography and editing that rarely let characters blink during a shot—let alone let them close their eyes when they smile. This is a choice to subordinates realism for a stylistic effect.

When we give genuine smiles, our faces crinkle, our lips rise toward our nose, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on. If filmmakers don’t want their actors to look like this, they can simply avoid real smiles and just use acted half-smiles instead.

In interpersonal interactions, everything feels better when someone is expressing intense humor tells. But in spectator entertainment, an intense smile can strike us as unusual or come off as unappealing. 

For instance, if we were talking to the actor below, we'd prefer he smile like he is on the right—since then we'd both be feeling connection, comfort, delight. But when we’re simply looking at a still picture, the broad smile looks a bit odd. We don't currently think characters should smile broadly in movies like this:

style="max-width: ; margin-left: "
>





(and so on)
For most movies, emotional realism isn't the goal. Instead, the goal is the emotional handling of the audience—not realism for realism's sake. 

We'll be talking more about spectator humor profiles throughout this chapter.
