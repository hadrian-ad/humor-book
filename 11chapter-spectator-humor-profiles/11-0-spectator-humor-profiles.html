11. Spectator humor profiles
</h1>


<p>Last chapter we looked at <a href="../10chapter-spectator-entertainment/10-0-spectator-entertainment.html#exclude-navigation">spectator entertainment</a>. In this chapter, we’ll look at how actors and characters depict humor in spectator entertainment. These are <vocab>spectator humor profiles</vocab>.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">We said before that each person has a <a href="../9chapter-humor-profile/9-0-humor-profile.html#exclude-navigation">humor profile</a>. Our humor profile is how we express humor tells, specific to ourselves.</p> 
   
<p class="considertext">But if we act in a play, we won't transplant our actual humor profile to the stage wholesale. Instead, we'll use a spectator humor profile.</p> 
    </div>

<p>   
    We can usually tell the difference between the actor <term>acting</term> humor tells <callback>(spectator humor profile)</callback> and the actor themselves <em>feeling</em> humor <callback>(personal humor profile)</callback>—in part because the humor we feel is exponentionally more nuanced and vivid than the humor we can act out:</p>

<p>We don’t always notice how artificial acted humor is until someone points it out—but then it's something that's hard to unsee.</p>


<p>We'll be talking more about spectator humor profiles throughout this chapter.</p>

    <div class="box">

   <p><headline>Purpose.</headline> There are a few reason spectator humor profiles exist for live actors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Most actors can’t convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command. We can watch a video of ourselves doubled over with laughter, and then try to do this perfectly on command—we can't, and actors can't either!</li>
    
    <li>Laughing can take a long time! In actual conversations with high-intensity humor, laughing takes up a substantial portion of the interaction—which most movies don't want for pacing reasons.</li>


    <button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Video example</button>
    
    <div class="content-example">
    
    <p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds long—10% of the scene!</p>
    
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/si7-GBpm1vU?si=na9oDKeH7bRVebC8&amp;start=72&amp;end=96;" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    
    <p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively <term>common</term> in our day-to-day lives, this scene is distinctive for many of us because long laughs are <em>uncommon</em> in television.</p>
  
         </div>

    <li>Our face changes when we give genuine smiles—our skin crinkles, our lips rise toward our nose, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on. Some movies have a style of cinematography and editing that rarely lets actors or characters blink, let along squint their eyes when they smile! They're making a choice to subordinate realism for a stylistic effect.</li>
    


    <li>In some kinds of spectator entertainment, an intense smile can strike us as unusual or come off as unappealing. In this case, what feels good in our lives doesn't feel as good on a screen.</li> 
    </ul>
    
    
<div class="for-instance">    
            <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
             
             <p class="for-instance-text">If we were <term>talking</term> to the actor below at a bus stop, we'd prefer he smile like he is on the right—since then we'd both be feeling <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>.</p> 
             
             <p class="for-instance-text">But when we’re simply <em>looking</em> at a still picture, the broad smile looks a bit odd. It's not how we're used to confident characters expressing humor.</p>
        
            <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-0-spectator-humor-profiles/11-0-3-han-solo-2.png"
        
        title=""
        alt=""
        style="max-width: ; margin-left: "
        >
        
        </div>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>All of these factors can lead to spectator humor profiles—like a smirk instead of a happy smile—a brief bark of laughter instead of a long trailing laugh—and so on.</p>

<p>For most movies, the emotional <term>handling</term> of the audience is the goal—not emotional <em>realism</em> for realism's sake. This includes how actors use humor tells.</p>
