11. Spectator humor profiles
</h1>


<p>Last chapter we looked at <a href="../10chapter-spectator-entertainment/10-0-spectator-entertainment.html#exclude-navigation"><strong>spectator entertainment</strong></a>. In this chapter, we’ll look at how characters in spectator entertainment <em>express</em> humor—their <term>spectator humor profile</term>.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">We said before that each person has a <a href="../9chapter-humor-profile/9-0-humor-profile.html#exclude-navigation"><strong>humor profile</strong></a>. Our humor profile is how we express humor tells, specific to that person.</p> 
   
<p class="considertext">But if we act in a play, we won't transplant our actual humor profile to the stage wholesale—instead, we'll use a <em>spectator</em> humor profile.</p> 
    </div>

<p>We can usually tell when it’s the <em>character</em> showing humor tells (<term>spectator</term> humor profile) and when it’s the <em>actor</em> showing humor tells (<term>personal</term> humor profile)—in part because personal humor profiles are exponentially more vivid than spectator humor profiles:</p>

<p>Often, we don’t notice how artificial spectator humor profiles are until someone points them out—like how the actor above never tries to give his character realistic humor tells, even over a half-a-dozen films.</p>

<p>We'll be talking more about spectator humor profiles throughout this chapter.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsibleBOX">Memorable laughs</button>
    
    <div class="contentBOX">

   <p>The humor tells we see in spectator entertainment is by-and-large artifical. There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Many actors can’t convincingly act medium-intensity or higher humor on command. <callback>("Now pretend it's the best day of your life!")</callback> To accommodate this, movies will avoid scripting this intensity of humor</li>
    
    <li>Laughing takes a long time! Having a realistic amount of it in a movie would mess with pacing. To accomodate this, spectator humor profiles often show intense humor in ways other than long moments of laughter. </li>

    <p>In the emotional climax of a series, two friends share a long laugh. The climactic scene is two minutes long, and their their shared laugh during it is 13 seconds long—10% of the scene!</p>
    
    <p>Even though long laughs like this are relatively common in our day-to-day lives, they're not in this show—because the show has no reason to have realistic duration humor just for realism's sake.</p>
    
    <p>This particular scene is distinctive not just for it's long laugh, but for sounding more like a real laugh at the end. The voice actor moves into a higher pitch of laughter at the end, with some audio distortion as if the actor is laughing in a way that moves him away from the mic.</p>

    <li>When we give genuine smiles, our faces crinkle, our lips rise toward our nose, our eyes change shape, dimples form, and so on. If filmmakers don’t want their actors to look like this, they can simply avoid real smiles and just use acted half-smiles instead.</li>
    
    <li>Movies often have a style of cinematography and editing that rarely let actors or characters blink during a shot—let alone let them realistically close their eyes when they smile. This is a stylistic choice to subordinate realism for a visual effect.</li>

    <li>In interpersonal interactions, everything feels better when someone is expressing intense humor tells. But in spectator entertainment, an intense smile can strike us as unusual or come off as unappealing.</li> 
    </ul>
    
<div class="for-instance">    
            <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
             
             <p class="for-instance-text">If we were talking to the actor below, we'd prefer he smile like he is on the right—since then we'd both be feeling <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>.</p> 
             
             <p class="for-instance-text">But when we’re simply looking at a still picture, the broad smile looks a bit odd. We don't currently think characters should smile broadly in movies like this:</p>

        </div>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>For most movies, emotional realism isn't the goal. Instead, the goal is the emotional handling of the <em>audience</em>—not realism for realism's sake. This includes how actors use humor tells.</p>
