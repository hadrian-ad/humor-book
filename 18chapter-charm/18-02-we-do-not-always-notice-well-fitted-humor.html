    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We don't always notice well-fitted humor</h1>   
    
   
<p>We don’t always notice fitted humor. For instance, we express humor tells when we:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>get really great hugs</li>
    <li>step into someone’s house to visit them</li>
    <li>are complimented on our outfit</li>
    <li>hear good news</li>
    <li>greet a friend</li>
    <li>step out from the cold</li>
    <li>get a text from a good friend</li>
    <li>are offered a glass of water</li>
    <li>open a perfect gift</li>
    <li>reconcile with someone after a disagreement</li>
    <li>are served delicious-looking food</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>These are all moments where we evaluate mistakes as OK. Once it’s pointed out, it’s obvious that we smile and laugh during these moments—even so, it’s often not until it’s pointed out that we think to notice the humor:</p>


<p><narration>Zoe comes in from the rain, and has to push against the door to close it against the wind. Inside, her apartment is calm and quiet, with the rain against the windows.</narration></p> 

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Phew!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe has survived a stressful situation, her tensions have eased, she has a new perspective, her negative emotions have changed into positive ones)</notes></p>

<p>Zoe won’t necessarily register this as humor—or even that she laughed. That’s because smiling when she comes home is so well-fitted that she just feels it as one moment unfolding easily into the next, a bit like how it feels to use stairs and not really notice them:</p>

<p>Often, we don't have a name for low-intensity, well-fitted humor—and we often aren't screening ourselves for humor anyway, outside of comedic spectator entertainment. This can make it hard to notice this humor in our lives:</p>

 

<p><narration>Zoe is waiting for the bus. It’s drizzly and grey. Then, the bus pulls around the corner, the headlights shining through the rain. Zoe steps out of the shelter to the edge of the curb in anticipation.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe experiences low-intensity humor tells like brightening, energy, loosening, smiling, focusing on present, raised spirits&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe feels comfort, release, relief, safety, welcome)</notes></p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: ">


<p><narration>Zoe lines up with everyone else to file into the bus. Zoe taps her phone at the farebox when it’s her turn. This always makes her a tiny bit anxious. Then it beeps and gives a green light, the driver waves her in, and she takes her seat.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels low-intensity relief, welcome, and so on)</notes></p> 



<p>Despite this humor being decent charm—since it’s relatively fitted—Zoe doesn’t really think to notice this humor until it’s pointed out.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think humor is comedy, and so we try to understand all humor in terms of being “comedic.” But that would be odd—a bit like thinking eating is restaurants, and then trying to understand all eating in terms of being “restaurantic.”</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">That would be taking something niche that came second (comedy/restaurants), and then trying to use it to back-explain the much wider thing that came first (humor/eating).</p>
    </div>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Importance.</headline> If we only measure humor by intensity, then any low-intensity humor seems “bad” compared to high-intensity humor. In which case, it might not seem worthwhile to register these moments of low-intensity humor—a bit like how we may feel it's not worth it to stop and pick up a penny.</p>
    
    <p>Things change when we have a second measure, like fittedness. This lets us think about how fitted humor can be worth paying attention too, even if the intensity of humor never crests into broad smiles and laughter.</p>
    
    <p>That’s because it’s worth noticing the presence or absence of acceptance, belonging, generosity, insight, and so on—whether they come intensely or not. Fittedness is part of how we us understand our emotional relation to the moment or the world around us—our changing sense of belonging or so on.</p>
