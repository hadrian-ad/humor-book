    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We don't always notice well-fitted humor</h1>   
    
   
<p>We don’t always notice fitted humor. For instance, we express humor tells when we:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>get really great hugs</li>
    <li>step into someone’s house to visit them</li>
    <li>are complimented on our outfit</li>
    <li>hear good news</li>
    <li>greet a friend</li>
    <li>step out from the cold</li>
    <li>get a text from a good friend</li>
    <li>are offered a glass of water</li>
    <li>open a perfect gift</li>
    <li>reconcile with someone after a disagreement</li>
    <li>are served delicious-looking food</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>These are all moments where we evaluate mistakes as OK. Even though it's obvious we <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seek</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increase energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>have active eyes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>become optimistic</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>move non-normatively</humor-tell>, and so on during these moments, it's often not until it's pointed out that we actually notice this humor <sem>as</sem> humor:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe comes in from the rain, and has to push against the door to close it against the wind. Inside, her apartment is calm and quiet, with the rain against the windows.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Phew!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe has survived a stressful situation, her tensions have eased, she has a new perspective, her negative emotions have changed into positive ones)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Zoe won’t necessarily register this as humor—or even that she laughed. That’s because smiling when she comes home is so well-fitted that she just feels it as one moment unfolding easily into the next, a bit like how it feels to use stairs and not really notice them:</p>

<p>Often, we don't have a name for well-fitted humor—and often we aren't screening ourselves for humor outside of comedic spectator entertainment. This lack of a name and lack of attention can make it hard to notice this humor in our lives:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is waiting for the bus. It’s drizzly and grey. Then, the bus pulls around the corner, the headlights shining through the rain. Zoe steps out of the shelter to the edge of the curb in anticipation.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe experiences low-intensity humor tells like brightening, energy, loosening, smiling, focusing on present, raised spirits&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe feels comfort, release, relief, safety, welcome)</notes></p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe lines up with everyone else to file into the bus. Zoe taps her phone at the farebox when it’s her turn. This always makes her a tiny bit anxious. Then it beeps and gives a green light, the driver waves her in, and she takes her seat.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels low-intensity relief, welcome, and so on)</notes></p>
</div> 



<p>Despite this humor being decent charm—since it’s relatively fitted—Zoe doesn’t really think to notice this humor until it’s pointed out.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think humor <sem>is</sem> comedy, and so we try to understand all humor in terms of being “comedic.” But that would be odd—a bit like thinking eating <sem>is</sem> restaurants, and then trying to understand all eating in terms of being “restaurantic.”</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">That would be taking something niche that came second <callback>(comedy/restaurants)</callback>, and then trying to use it to back-explain the much wider thing that came first <callback>(humor/eating)</callback>.</p>
    </div>
 
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Importance.</headline> If we <term>only</term> measure humor by intensity, then <em>any</em> low-intensity humor seems “bad” compared to high-intensity humor. This is like how a penny seems "bad" compared to a dollar&mdash;and so we may not stop and notice or curate low-intensity experience of humor, fitted or otherwise.</p>
    
<p>Money has <term>one</term> value of comparison, magnitude. But other things have <em>two</em> values of comparison. For instance, food has taste and size. 
     
<p>We <term>sometimes</term> care most about portion size&mdash;but not <em>always</em>. Sometimes we care more about how it tastes. And we can appreciate tiny portions of food if they taste really, really good.</p> 
      
<p>This is like humor. There are two comparable values: intensity and fittedness. How we prioritize these measures changes situation-by-situation, but fitted moments of humor are worth paying attention to&mdash;even if the intensity never crests into broad smiles and laughter.</p>
        
    <p>That’s because it’s worth noticing the presence or absence of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, and so on—whether those things come intensely or not. By paying attention to the amount of fittedness, we track our emotional relation to the world around us—our changing sense of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions> or so on.</p>
