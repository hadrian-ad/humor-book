   <p>A humor attempt can prioritize fittedness or intensity&mdash;and so a humor attempt can be a <vocab>comedy attempt</vocab> or a <vocab>charm attempt</vocab>:</p>

<p>If we're prioritizing fittedness, the humor above is good&mdash;and the intensity of humor is neither here nor there.</p>
   
<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
       <p class="considertext"> When we prioritizing or judging by fittedness, that doesn't mean there <term>isn't</term> intense humor. It just means the intensity doesn't <em>factor</em> much into whether we see the charm attempt as successful or not.</p>
       
       <p class="considertext">If we want to play a game with a good story, we'll judge the game by the story&mdash;and whether the graphics are good or bad are neither here nor there.</p>
   </div>
   
<p>It gives us a way of looking at moments of humor in a different way&mdash;including moments of humor that aren't particularly intense or not comedic, like waiting for a bus or being given a gglass of water.</p>


<div class="box">
  
    <p><headline>Restaurantic.</headline> Sometimes we think humor <sem>is</sem> comedy, and so we try to understand all humor in terms of being “comedic.” But that would be odd—a bit like thinking eating <sem>is</sem> restaurants, and then trying to understand all eating in terms of being “restaurantic.”</p>
    
    <p>That would be taking something niche that came second <callback>(comedy/restaurants)</callback>, and then trying to use it to back-explain the much wider thing that came first <callback>(humor/eating)</callback>.</p>
