    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We have a preference for charm over comedy</h1>   
    
   
<p>We have a long-term preference for charm. Comedy tends to be only transiently important to us.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We saw this in miniature with Brad and Zoe. When Zoe thinks back to her gallery opening years later, she probably won’t remember any puns that Brad made there (“got your oil shop up and running!”)—but she probably will remember him helping her feel accomplishment and achievement (“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”).</p>
</div>

<p>This long-term preference for charm is true for both our interpersonal lives and in spectator entertainment. </p>



<h2>We have a long-term preference for interpersonal charm.</h2>

<p>When we think about the people we felt the most connection with throughout our life, or wish we got to know better, it’s usually the people who have made us feel the most fitted humor.</p>

 

<p>By contrast, if we think back to the various social eras of our lives and try to remember the funny one of the group, we may realize we haven’t thought of them in a while:</p>



<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <narration>“Hey. Remember Josh B.?”</narration></p>
<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*puts down fork*</action> <action>*puts head in hand*</action> <narration>“Oh my god. Josh B.! I haven’t thought of him in ages.”</narration></p>
<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <narration>“Do you think he really drank that bottle of pee, or was he just joking?”</narration></p>
<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <narration>“I have no idea. I just remember him singing hundred bottles of beer in AP Lit. Mrs. Gardiner was pissed.”</narration> </p>

 

<p>At the time, Zoe and Emma may have giggled at Josh B. along with everyone else—but when they remember him years later, they forget the intensity and remember the unfittedness.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>
<p>Josh B. single-mindedly focused on intensity of humor, without any concern for fittedness. He made funny remarks at the serious parts of movies; undercut sincere moments with meta-commentary; only wanted to watch outrageous comedies; and so on. He fixated on using intensity as a measure of good humor, which was at odds with how people around him usually determined good humor.
    </p>
 

<p>Josh may have noticed that even though people laughed, he didn't really form lasting connection with them. That's because fittedness (charm) is involved with connection and cohesion—and so class clowns often only feel tenuously integrated with the people they make laugh, and tend to be forgotten relatively quickly.</p>

 

<p>By contrast, memories of achievement, belonging, generosity, realization, safety, and so on tend to persist, since we recall those experiences easily. Years later, Emma and Zoe probably fondly remember moments of kind smiles or unsolicited help.</p>



<p><narration>When Zoe was a freshmen, she dropped her notebook and someone swooped down and picked it up, handing it to her with a smile. Zoe smiles back. For some reason, it sticks with her, even now as a senior.</narration> <notes>(&larr;memories of connection, generosity, relief, welcome, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>



<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <narration>“Remember when you got ‘Best Foam Rollercoaster’ in sixth grade?”</narration></p>
<p>Emma: <action>*smiled*</action> <narration>“Proudest day of my life!”</narration> <notes>(&larr;memories of accomplishment, achievement, appreciation, success, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>



<p><narration>Emma wishes she had gotten to know her grandparents better. She remembers enjoying visiting them when she was very young.</narration> <notes>(&larr;memories of generosity, safety, welcome, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>



<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <narration>“Remember Sandra?”</narration></p>
<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <narration>“Of course! She was so nice.”</narration></p>
<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <narration>“She drew me a picture for my birthday in fifth grade! It was a chicken, I think.”</narration> <notes>(&larr;memories of appreciation, connection, generosity, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>



<p>Sandra’s charm attempts weren’t as flashy as Josh B.’s humor attempts. But Josh B.’s comedy attempts faded in importance over time, while Sandra’s charm attempts persisted as positive. Since humor family words and humor outcomes persist in our memories, in a way that intensity usually doesn't, we have a long-term preference for charm. </p>



<h2>We have a long-term preference for spectator charm.</h2>

<p>When we think back to our favorite entertainment over the years, the things that come to mind are usually things with lots of charm to them. It wasn’t that they weren’t comedic—it was instead that they could occasionally stop prioritizing intensity and take time to prioritize fittedness instead.</p>

 

<p>This entertainment struck a meaningful chord with us because they gave us feelings of acceptance, comfort, insight, and so on, and helped us reach humor outcomes. These might be stories about:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>sponges and squids that deal with work and boredom in different ways</li>
    <li>office workers who are dysfunctional but endearing families in a small town with a nuclear power plant</li>
    <li>doctors during a war</li>
    <li>a space crew of mercenaries and passengers</li>
    <li>washed up and depressed animals past the peak of their careers</li>
    <li>friends travelling between elemental nations</li>
    <li>a sad cop who lost his memory and talks to himself a lot</li>
    <li>puppets and people that live on the same block</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>



<p>We remember charm fondly in spectator entertainment for the same reason we remember charm from friends or strangers years later—it was the charm mixed into the comedy that kept these things meaningful to us over longer periods of time.</p> 



<p>By contrast, the things that were primarily comedic might take more effort to remember. We might have watched a show about talking cat butts years ago, and felt like we were about to die of laughter—but as we change, or the cultural milieu changes, we might forget about it, and our memory of it isn’t straightforwardly positive.</p>

 

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <narration>“Hey. Remember lil' bits?”</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*puts fork down*</action> <action>*puts hands on her head*</action> <narration>“Oh my god."</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe doesn't often remember humor that had low fittedness, and when she does it's not always a straightforwardly positive memory)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <narration>"Those skits were so weeeiiirrd.”</narration> </p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <narration>"Remember how we couldn't stop laughing?"</narration></p>

 





<p>Emma and Zoe found this memorable in part because of the humor family words they felt having watched it together. They have positive memories of connection (with each other), but their relation to the comedy attempt itself is more ambiguous. The show itself is relatively unimportant compared to their experience with each other.</p> 



<p>Similarly, If we try to show our romantic partner our favorite internet videos from when we were in high school, we may suddenly see them as mean, niche, nostalgic, old, random, pointless, weird, or so on—they don’t always hold up well as we change. But old videos that prioritize fittedness often hold up better than videos that don’t.</p>

<p>This long-term preference for charm isn’t surprising. We saw last chapter how fittedness was involved with group efficiency and cohesion—which means charm often marks constructive moments in our lives.</p>

<p>Beyond this, we can think of humor family words as the emotional orientation of our lives. We emotionally orient toward acceptance, achievement, appreciation, comfort, connection, delight, generosity, insight, joy, revelation, relief, safety, welcome, and so on.</p> 

<p>By extension, we orient toward the people, moments, things, and so on that we find charming—that help us feel humor family words.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <headline>Intensity.</headline> Between two equally intense moments of humor, we’ll usually remember the one with greater fittedness more fondly. That’s because—all things being equal—we’d rather feel intense humor we describe as closeness, joy, welcome, and so on than intense humor we don’t.
