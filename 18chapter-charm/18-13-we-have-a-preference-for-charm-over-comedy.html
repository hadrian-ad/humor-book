    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We have a preference for charm over comedy</h1>   
    
   
<p>We have a long-term preference for charm. Comedy tends to be only transiently important to us.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We saw this in miniature with Brad and Zoe. When Zoe thinks back to her gallery opening years later, she probably won’t remember any puns that Brad made there <callback>(“got your oil shop up and running!”)</callback>—but she probably <sem-weak>will</sem-weak> remember him helping her feel <emotions>accomplishment</emotions> and <emotions>achievement</emotions> <callback>(“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”)</callback>.</p>
</div>

<p>This long-term preference for charm is true for both our interpersonal lives and in spectator entertainment. </p>



<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We have a long-term preference for <outcome-contrast>interpersonal</outcome-contrast> charm.</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we think about the people we felt the most connection with throughout our life, or wish we had gotten to know better, it’s usually the people who have made us feel the most <sem>fitted</sem> humor.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>By contrast, if we think back to the various social eras of our lives and try to remember the funny one of the group, we may realize we haven’t thought of them in a while:</p>
    
    
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Hey. Remember Josh B.?”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*puts down fork*</action> <action>*puts head in hand*</action> <speech>“Oh my god. Josh B.! I haven’t thought of him in ages.”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Do you think he really drank that bottle of pee, or was he just joking?”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“I have no idea. I just remember him singing hundred bottles of beer in AP Lit. Mrs. Gardiner was pissed.”</speech> </p>
    </div>
    
     
    
    <p>At the time, Zoe and Emma may have giggled at Josh B. along with everyone else—but when they remember him years later, they forget the intensity and mainly remember the unfittedness.</p>
    
    <div class="consider">
        <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">Josh B. single-mindedly focused on intensity of humor, without any concern for fittedness. He made funny remarks at the serious parts of movies; undercut sincere moments with meta-commentary; only wanted to watch outrageous comedies; and so on.</p> 
           
           <p class="considertext">He fixated on using intensity as a measure of good humor, which was at odds with how people around him actually determine good humor.</p>
            
    </div>
     
    
    <p>Josh may have noticed that even though people laughed, he didn't really form lasting connection with them. That's because fittedness is involved with connection and cohesion—and so class clowns often only feel tenuously integrated with the people they make laugh, and tend to be forgotten relatively quickly.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>By contrast, memories of <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, and so on tend to persist, since we recall those experiences easily. Years later, Emma and Zoe probably fondly remember moments of kind smiles or unsolicited moments of help.</p>
    
    
    
    <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>When Zoe was a freshmen, she dropped her notebook and someone swooped down and picked it up, handing it to her with a smile. Zoe smiles back. For some reason, it sticks with her, even now as a senior.</narration> <notes>(&larr;memories of <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>

    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Remember when you got ‘Best Foam Rollercoaster’ in sixth grade?”</speech></p>
        <p>Emma: <action>*smiled*</action> <speech>“Proudest day of my life!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;memories of <emotions>accomplishment</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>success</emotions>, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>
    </div>

She remembers enjoying visiting them when she was very young.</narration> <notes>(&larr;memories of <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>

    <div class="vignette">
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Remember Sandra?”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Of course! She was so nice.”</speech></p>
        <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“She drew me a picture for my birthday in fifth grade! It was a chicken, I think.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;memories of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, and so on are durable and vivid)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
    
    
    <p>Sandra’s charm attempts weren’t as flashy as Josh B.’s humor attempts. But Josh B.’s comedy attempts faded in importance over time, while Sandra’s charm attempts persisted as positive. Since humor family words and humor outcomes persist in our memories, in a way that intensity usually doesn't, we have a long-term preference for charm. </p>
</div>



<h2 style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">We have a long-term preference for <outcome-contrast>spectator</outcome-contrast> charm.</h2>

<div class="h2">
    <p>When we think back to our favorite entertainment over the years, the things that come to mind are usually things with lots of charm to them. It wasn’t that they <term>weren’t</term> comedic—it was instead that they could <em>occasionally</em> stop prioritizing intensity and take time to prioritize fittedness instead.</p>
    
     
    
    <p>This entertainment struck a meaningful chord with us because they gave us feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, and so on, and helped us reach humor outcomes. These might be media about:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>sponges and squids that deal with work and boredom in different ways</li>
        <li>office workers who are dysfunctional but endearing</li> 
        
        <li>families in a small town with a nuclear power plant</li>
        <li>doctors during a war</li>
        <li>a space crew of mercenaries and passengers</li>
        <li>washed up and depressed animals past the peak of their careers</li>
        <li>friends travelling between elemental nations</li>
        <li>a sad cop who lost his memory and talks to himself a lot</li>
        <li>puppets and people that live on the same block</li>
        </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>
    
    
    
    <p>We remember charm fondly in spectator entertainment years later for the same reason we remember charm from friends or strangers years later—it was the charm mixed into the comedy that kept these things meaningful to us over longer periods of time!</p> 
    
    
    
    <p>By contrast, the things that were primarily comedic might take more effort to remember. We might have watched a show about talking cat butts years ago, and felt like we were about to die of laughter—but as we change, or the cultural milieu changes, we might forget about it, and our memory of it isn’t straightforwardly positive.</p>

            <p class="considertext">This is why it can be odd to show our romantic partner our favorite internet videos from when we were in high school&mdash;we may suddenly see them as mean, niche, nostalgic, old, random, pointless, weird, or so on. They don’t always hold up well as we change. But old videos that prioritize fittedness often hold up better than videos that don’t.</p>

    <p>This long-term preference for charm isn’t surprising. We saw last chapter how fittedness was involved with group efficiency and cohesion—which means charm often marks constructive moments in our lives.</p>


<p>Beyond this, we can think of humor family words as the emotional orientation of our lives. We emotionally orient toward <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>achievement</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>comfort</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p> 

<p>And by extension, we orient toward the people, moments, things, and so on that we find charming—that help us feel humor family words.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> Between two equally intense moments of humor, we’ll usually remember the one with greater fittedness more fondly. That’s because—all things being equal—we’d rather feel intense humor we describe as <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>joy</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on than intense humor we don’t.</p>

    A deeper look (Are women funny?)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">
    
     
<p>In places and times that low-ranked women, it was generally agreed that most women were inferior to most men in things like civic awareness, courage, intelligence, industry, morality, leadership, rationality—and to boot, women weren’t very funny either. </p>

<p>Of course, it wasn’t just that women weren’t funny—women were the <term>opposite</term> of funny: they were killjoys, nagging, shrewish, shrill, thin-skinned, vain, and so on. But to cover all the bases, women were also seen as the <em>opposite</em> <outcome-contrast>opposite</outcome-contrast> of funny too: too caring, delicate, empathetic, moral, nurturing, observant, sensitive, sentimental, thoughtful, virtuous, and so on. </p>

<p>In other words, those societies saw women as bad at humor from both ends, even in incoherent and contradictory ways.</p>

<p>Through a variety of mechanisms, women in these societies were excluded from major roles in for-profit comedy, including as actors, directors, columnists, comedians, comics, screenwriters, radio jockeys, and so on—which created feedback loops of superficial confirmation of prejudices about women and humor.</p>

<p>In addition, the spectator entertainment that was popular with women-majority demographics was belittled and trivialized, so that the period dramas, romantic comedies, romances, sitcoms, soap operas, and so on that were almost exclusively watched by women weren’t seen as having good or worthwhile humor attempts.</p>

<p>This was in contrast to the spectator entertainment that was also popular with men, which was seen as good&mdash;as having greater authenticity, civic-worth, cultural value, daring, status, vivacity, and so on.</p>

<p>These prejudices—excluding and belittling women—have had a long life. We can see the stereotypes that pretended to justify this exclusion being both mocked and winked at in a in a 2001 episode of <i>Futurama</i>:</p>

<p>In the scene, the men discuss what they use to assess how good humor attempts are. For them, good humor was <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> boring and <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> primarily based on character or realistic situations. In this book, this is loosely similar to a preference for intensity, instead of fittedness.</p> 

<p>Without really ever thinking about it, many of us have absorbed the idea that intensity is the only important&mdash;or even the only possible&mdash;measure of humor. This is why we sometimes think that “good” humor is either gloriously stupid <callback>(“ice to see you”)</callback>, or something that pushes the envelope. <callback>(“I know I’m not supposed to say it, but…”)</callback> We sometimes don’t think there <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> be any other kind of good humor.</p>

<p>There’s obviously nothing wrong with enjoying and celebrating things that prioritize intensity of humor. Instead, the problem comes when we lose the ability to see that other measures of humor exist concurrently. We can maybe feel this ourselves in this chapter, where “charm” is something that’s both incredibly obvious and also hard to wrap our heads around.</p>

<p>All throughout our day-to-day lives, charm has been common, effective, enjoyable, familiar, memorable, normal, nice, powerful, versatile, and so on. Even so, we’ve often never really had a name for it—and it’s frequently been invisible because of it!</p>

<p>But as we start seeing fittedness as existing concurrently with intensity, our ability to use humor will become more capable and in accord to the world around us.</p>

    <div class="content">

<p>Our model of humor has two quantitative values: fittedness and intensity. We can weight these values in different ways when qualifying humor. When we give more weight to intensity than fittedness, we'll call it comedy. When we give more weight to fittedness that intensity, we'll call it charm.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
For people who don't think a measure of humor exists other than intensity, intensity is then given highest weight by default. But when we know we can give<a href="18-01-we-can-prioritize-different-measures-of-humor.html"> more weight to fittedness</a>, we can see a different set humor experiences become "good." This includes low-intensity humor that we <a href="18-03-we-often-feel-low-intensity-humor-but-don't-notice.html">don't always notice</a> as humor until it's pointed out.</li>
    
    <li>Fitted humor is an <a href="18-06-charm-is-an-outcome-not-method.html">outcome</a>, not a method. There are many methods to create fitted humor.
    </li>
    
    <li>We <a href="18-13-we-have-a-preference-for-charm-over-comedy.html">emotionally orient toward fitted humor</a>. For instance, we'll be drawn toward things that make us feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and other humor family words. Over time, this orientation gives us a long-term preference for charm over comedy.</li>
