    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">A case study of charm</h1>   
    
    <p>We can put everything together to see how we can  describe a scene that includes humor and a humor attempt:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe is watching a comedy show.</narration> </p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>Fleabag is stressed from a family reunion. She steps outside the restaurant to smoke. Hot Priest, one of the dinner guests, steps outside as well.</narration></p> 
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>"Fellow smoker. Have a spare one?"</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <speech>"Sure."</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <action>*hands him cigarette and lights it*</action></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*takes a drag*</action> <internalaction>(conversationally)</internalaction> <speech>"So does your family get together much, or&mdash;?"</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><narration>To destroy the possibility of small talk, Fleabag brusquely heads back inside.</narration></p> 
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <speech>"Fuck you, then."</speech></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <internalaction>(shocked)</internalaction> <action>*turns to stare at him*</action></p> 
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <action>*smiles broadly*</action>  <action>*heads inside*</action></p>
    
    
    <p><narration>Zoe smiles as she watches. They have good chemistry, and she can't wait to see what horrible things befall them this season.</narration></p>

<p>We can assemble a description of Hot Priest's comment. <callback>("Fuck you, then.")</callback></p>

<p>First, was it a humor attempt, or a mistake-predominant attempt? <callback>(Did he want her to smile or become angry?)</callback> It was a humor attempt.   

<p>Once we identify it as a humor attempt, we decide whether it was a charm attempt or a comedy attempt. <callback>(Was he prioritizing fittedness, or intensity?)</callback> It was prioritizing fittedness.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We know the priest's goal was to prioritize fittedness, not intensity. He foremost wanted to reach humor outcomes&mdash;like for her to think he <humor-outcome>supported an argument (that her action wasn't worthwhile)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport (with her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>became accepted (by her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduced (both of their) defensiveness, revealed a personality trait</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled (her) complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized (her actions)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolized ties (between them)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Whether she laughs or just smiles <callback>(intensity)</callback> isn't as relevant as whether or not she reaches these humor outcomes on relevant topics <callback>(fittedness)</callback>.</p>
</div>
 
<p>Finally, we ask if this was a low- or high-velocity charm attempt. <callback>(Was the priest ambling toward humor outcomes, or rushing for them?)</callback> It was high-velocity.</p>

<!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">The woman was guarding against humor outcomes. It took something with high velocity to break through these guards. <callback>("Fuck you, then.")</callback></p>
</div>
-->

<p>This lets us assemble a description of the priest's action in this scene: it was a <sem>successful high-velocity charm attempt</sem>:</p>

    alt="This flow chart shows how to describe comments. It says 'was it...' 1) humor attempt or anger attempt? (humor attempt.) 2) Was it comedy attempt or charm attempt? (charm attempt.) Was it low-velocity or high-velocity? (high velocity.) An arrow leads to the result, which is a small circle representing the comment or situation, which has a small line underneath for low-intensity, many integration lines behind for fittedness, and a large vector arrow for high-velocity. This is labeled 'it was a high-velocity charm attempt.'";
    title="Descriptive flow chart";
    style="max-width: 25rem ; margin-left: ">

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This describes the comment's relation to the emotional situation, without getting distracted by surface descriptions of content, like "insult."</p>
    </div>
<!--

<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">We might be tempted to first describe the priest's comment <callback>("fuck you, then")</callback> as an insult, something rude, teasing, and so on. The problem is that these words that don't always specificy an intention. <callback>("Is a ha-ha insult or a mean insult?")</callback></p>
        
        <p class="considertext">We can understand comments by instead focusing first on their intention and to what actually happens in an emotional situation. <callback>("No matter how else we might describe it, at base it was a high-velocity charm attempt that was successful.")</callback></p>
       </div>
-->
<!--

<p>We said before that high-velocity can get past defenses to reach humor tripwires. But that the same thing that makes high-velocity comments <term>effective</term> makes the consequences of <sem>not</sem> reaching humor tripwires <em>worse</em>.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
<p class="for-instance-text">If Hot Priest had just said <callback>"sorry, just trying to make conversation"</callback>, he probably wouldn't have made the woman smile&mdash;but he probably wouldn't create irreparable social damage either. By contrast, <callback>"fuck you"</callback> <term>may</term> make the woman smile&mdash;but may cause social damage if it <em>doesn't</em>.</p>
</div>
 
<p>How risky was this comment by the priest? Not particularly&mdash;the priest already has a good idea of what the emotional outcome will be: he has the competence to emotionally forecast that the woman will eventually feel he <humor-outcome>handled her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome> her&mdash;and not that he was <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>disgruntled</outcome-contrast> by her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized her</humor-outcome>. The priest had gained this competence through experience and practice.</p>
