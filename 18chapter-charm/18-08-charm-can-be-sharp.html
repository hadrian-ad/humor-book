<p>The word “charm” sometimes makes us think of things that are anodyne, artificial, bland, insincere, saccharine, soft, or so on. But fitted humor attempts (charm) occur in all kinds of ways—many of which don’t strike us saccharine or soft at all:</p> 


<p><speaker>Tutor:</speaker> <action>*finishes reading Zoe’s grad school application essay*</action> <action>*sighs*</action> <speech>“This is pretty terrible.”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*cathartic laugh*</action> <notes>(&larr;tutor charms Zoe with well-fitted humor)</notes> “Really? Oh no.”</p>



<p>At first, the tutor seems abrasive or rude—but the tutor was making a charm attempt. Since Zoe felt fitted humor, the charm attempt was successful too—she felt humor in ways she thought prioritized efficiency and cohesion:</p>





<p>To observers, the content and tone of charm can sometimes seem aggressive, direct, blunt, teasing, and so on—and it’s not until we check intentions and outcomes that we see them as charm attempts:</p>

 

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*to waiter*</action> <speech>“I’ll have the Spicy Tongue-Death Big Noodle Extreme, please.”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Waiter:</speaker> <action>*writing on pad*</action> <internalaction>(already decided)</internalaction> <internalaction>(condescendingly)</internalaction> <speech>“How about Mild String Bean Chicken instead?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;waiter prioritizes fittedness)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(surprised)</internalaction> <speech>“Uh, sure.”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Waiter:</speaker> <speech>“It’ll be right out.”</speech> <action>*leaves*</action></p>

<p><narration>Owen and Zoe look at each other and laugh.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen and Zoe feel the waiter controlled the situation, avoided conflict, supported an argument, circumvented (Owen’s) defensiveness, and so on)</notes></p>

 

<p><narration>Zoe knows Sara’s still upset with Emma, but she doesn’t know how to bring up the elephant in the room.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(casually)</internalaction> <speech>“So you still thinking about beheading Emma these days?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe prioritizes fittedness)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Sara is dealing with taboo topics, new topics of conversation are being opened)</notes> “Nah. More trouble than it’s worth, you know?”</p>

 

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*to Emma*</action> <speech>“I dunno. I’m embarrassed. I once had this awkward experience in middle school…”</speech>
    </p>
    
<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(incredulous)</internalaction> <speech>“You once had an awkward experience in middle school?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“I guess it is kinda silly.”</speech> <action>*laughs nervously*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“So was it something unforgivably awkward? Did you ask someone’s dad to marry you or vice versa?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma prioritizes fittedness)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“What! Jesus, no! I mean, it wasn’t such a big deal I guess.”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe achieves catharsis, gains a new perspective, feels Emma is supporting an argument, and so on)</notes></p>

 

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*hands back an essay*</action> <speech>“Not up to your usual standards, Emma.”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(irritated)</internalaction> <internalaction>(tired)</internalaction> <speech>“Yeah? Well I have a life.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma prioritizes fittedness)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Justin:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Fair enough. I’ll look forward to your final essay.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Justin feels Emma has handled criticism, controlled a situation, been acceptably criticized, gained a new perspective)</notes></p>

 

<p><narration>Minh matches with Amaya on a dating app.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Amaya:</speaker> <action>*texting*</action> <speech>“Gosh you’re cute.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Amaya prioritizes fittedness)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Minh:</speaker> <action>*flushes*</action> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Minh feels Amaya reveals a personal view)</notes></p>


<p>Charm doesn’t mean “bland kindness with all sharp edges rubbed off.” It just means someone is giving more weight to the fittedness of someone's humor, not the intensity. This can be done softly or sharply.</p>
