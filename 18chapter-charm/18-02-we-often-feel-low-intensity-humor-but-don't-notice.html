    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We don't always notice low-intensity humor. </h1>   
    
<p>Sometimes we don't notice our humor. To think about this, we can imagine walking on the road in the photo below:</p>

            <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-03-we-often-feel-low-intensity-humor-but-do-not-notice-that-we-do/18-03-0-gloomy-walk.jpg

<p>This photo is almost gloomy&mdash;not what we conventionally associate with humor. But can we imagine feeling humor while we walk here?</p>

<p>To catch this humor, we can imagine we're:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>feeling the briskness of late fall air</li>
    <li>smelling wet leaves and pines</li>
    <li>enjoying the use of our legs</li>
    <li>exploring somewhere new</li>
    <li>feeling light mist on our face</li>
    <li>hearing forest birds</li>
    <li>knowing we’ll be able to return to comfort</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>

<p>With those in mind, would we be showing any humor tells, reaching any humor outcomes, or feeling any humor family words?</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>humor tells</strong> (<humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reduce physical tension</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focus on the present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increase agency</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>feel optimism</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raise our spirits</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reduce stress</humor-tell>, and so on)</li>
    
    <li><strong>humor outcomes</strong> (<humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>control (our own) situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>create rapport (with ourselves or the world)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>change negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>, and so on)</li>
    
    <li><strong>humor family words</strong> (<emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once it's pointed out, it's obvious we could feel humor on this walk. We might <humor-tell>focus on the present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>feel optimistic</humor-tell> with <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell>, have <humor-tell>reduced stress</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We'll feel this humor even if nothing about the place, photo, or walk strikes us as stereotypically comedic. That's because we feel humor from mistakes and OKs balancing. This happens from a walk just like it does from a show.</p>
</div>

<p>This may be low-intensity, high-fittedness humor. So is this humor good or bad? The answer changes depending on what we're prioritizing:</p>

    title="";
    style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left: 1rem;">
    

<p>In this case, even if it’s an unremarkable experience of <term>comedy</term>, the walk would be a good experience of <em>charm</em>.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
            <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            <p class="considertext">The point of all this isn't to say one measure is "better" than another. Instead, the point is to notice that two points of comparison lets us think multi-dimensionally about humor&mdash;including the humor that happens all across our lives.

<p>We can think about charm in other photos too. If we imagine <term>being</term> at these places—not just <em>looking</em> at them—we can think about whether or not we'd show humor tells, reach humor outcomes, or feel humor family words:</p>

<p>None of these places were designed to make people chuckle and laugh the entire time. Most of our experiences in these places or moments would be with low-intensity of humor.</p> 

<p>If we’re judging humor by intensity, the humor we’d feel from being in these pictures would be “bad.” But if we judge by fittedness, we’d see this humor as “good”—and so would be worth noticing and self-monitoring for.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Limits.</headline> We sometimes only notice humor where we expect to find it. The humor outside those moments is invisible to us&mdash;like how it's not always obvious that we feel humor on nice walks until it's ponited out&mdash;and then it's very obvious.</p> 
    
    <p>Often, this is because we're used to looking for and valuing <term>intense</term> humor. By contrast, we don't always think of <em>fitted</em> humor <sem>as</sem> humor unless it's also intense. We do this because we often default to prioritizing intensity as "good" humor.</p>
    
    <p>Walks can generate well-fitted, low-intensity humor&mdash;just like ballet, buildings, clothes, sounds, speech, walks, and so on do all the time. We can learn to pay attention to this low-intensity humor&mdash;and even have reasons to think of this low-intensity humor as good humor by some measures:</p>
