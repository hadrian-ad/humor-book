<p>We improve at charm through small adjustments here and there—and by being more careful about our observations of others:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*to drama team*</action> <speech>“I remember when I was cast as the slug in my fifth grade play about compost…”</speech> <action>*crowd chuckles*</action></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*to drama team*</action> <speech>“You guys are lucky you have so much talent—I remember when I was cast as the slug in our fifth grade play about compost…”</speech> <action>*crowd laughs*</action></p>
</div>

<p>Sam increase his charm by a small adjustment&mdash;not by suddenly switching to an entirely different persona. He didn’t have to imitate someone he wasn’t like, or substantially change what he was saying.</p>

<p>Instead, he just made small changes—which made a big difference.</p>

<p>We don’t improve our charm through an impossible metamorphosis of our personality. Instead, most of the time, we improve our charm attempts through small adjustments in our day-to-day interactions with others.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">We’re used to these small changes being important all across our lives. A millimeter here and there isn’t trivial to screw sizes, and even in a six foot window pane a half-an-inch isn't trivial to whether something fits or not. These things fit or don’t fit on this kind of precision!</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">It's the same for our interactions with others. Sam’s comment will be fitted or not based on small things like eye-contact or a brief prelude. These "interaction millimeters" are often how we improve our charm attempts—that is, we improve through attention to small details, not dramatic changes.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This can seem unbearably finicky at the beginning. But this isn't unique to humor. Baking, building, drumming, gaming, painting, and so on are also all based on the importance of small things. These seem finicky at first, but that feeling went away as we got more familiar with it.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Eventually, the importance of small things becomes something normal and even empowering, and the skill revolves around mastery and exploration of these small things&mdash;in humor as in anything else.</p>
    
    </div>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Personality.</headline> When we don’t know much about charm or what controls fittedness, we sometimes focus on the wrong thing. Instead of thinking that charm is about small adjustments toward efficiency, cohesion, relevance, humor family words, humor outcomes, and so on—we wrongly think charm is only about macro elements of personality.</p>
    
    <div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
        <p class="for-instance-text">We may know someone who is both gregarious and charming. We may then link them: to be good at charm, we <sem>have</sem> to be gregarious—or at least <sem-weak>pretend</sem-weak> to be. But this often confuses a means <callback>(gregariousness)</callback> with the ends <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>.</p>
        
        <p class="for-instance-text">It’s obvious that being gregarious isn’t the same thing as being charming—since we know gregarious people who <sem>aren’t</sem> charming, but annoying to people! The gregariousness is neither here nor there—what matters is whether or not they generate fitted humor.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>When we look for it, we’ll notice that we know charming people with a wide variety of personalities. The people we know who make us feel fitted humor may be any combination of awkward, direct, brusque, careful, flamboyant, focused, forward, generous, impulsive, gruff, kind, loud, premeditative, quiet, sincere, shy, thoughtful, and so on.</p>
    
    <p>As before, we can avoid confusing a means <callback>(gruffness)</callback> to an ends <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>—since we also know gruff people who aren’t charming. What matters is the fitted humor.</p>
    
    <p>This is why becoming more charming isn’t an impossible matter of changing our personality, where we somehow become charming all at once. Instead, how charming we are or aren't depends on our ability to observe emotional situations and make small adjustments accordingly.</p>
