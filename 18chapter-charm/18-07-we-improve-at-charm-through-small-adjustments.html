<p>We improve at charm through small adjustments here and there—and by being more careful about our observations of others:</p>

<p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*to drama team*</action> <speech>“I remember when I was cast as the slug in my fifth grade play about compost…”</speech> <action>*crowd chuckles*</action></p>

<p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>

<p><speaker>Sam:</speaker> <action>*to drama team*</action> <speech>“You guys are lucky you have so much talent—I remember when I was cast as the slug in our fifth grade play about compost…”</speech> <action>*crowd laughs*</action></p>

<p>Sam didn’t increase his charm by suddenly switching to an entirely different persona. He also didn’t try to imitate someone he wasn’t like. He didn’t even have to substantially change what he was saying.</p>

<p>Instead, he just made small changes—which made a big difference.</p>

 

<p>We don’t improve our charm through an unobtainable metamorphosis of our personality. Instead, most of the time, we improve our charm attempts through small adjustments. This happens within how we normally interact with others.</p>

   <div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p>We’re used to these small changes being important all across our lives. A millimeter here and there isn’t trivial to screw sizes—just like half-an-inch here and there isn’t trivial to whether a new window pane fits. These things fit or don’t fit on this kind of precision!</p>
    
    <p>It's the same for our interactions with others. A screw will often fit or not based on millimeters—just like Sam’s comment will be fitted or not based on eye-contact or a small prelude. These "conversational millimeters" are often how we improve our charm attempt—attention to small details, not dramatic changes.</p>
    
    <p>This can seem unbearably finicky at the beginning. But we can compare it to other skills which also seemed finicky at the beginning, but lost that feeling as we improved at it—like in baking, building, drumming, gaming, painting, and so on. Eventually, the importance of small things becomes something normal and even empowering.</p>

<p><headline>Personality.</headline> When we don’t know much about charm or what controls fittedness, we sometimes focus on the wrong thing. Instead of thinking that charm is about small adjustments toward efficiency, cohesion, relevance, humor family words, humor outcomes, and so on—we wrongly think charm is only about macro elements of personality.</p>

<p>For instance, we may know someone who is both gregarious and charming. We may then link them: to be good at charm, we have to be gregarious—or at least pretend to be. But this often confuses a means (gregariousness) with the ends (fitted humor).</p>

<p>It’s obvious that being gregarious isn’t the same thing as being charming—since we know gregarious people who aren’t charming, but annoying! The gregariousness is neither here nor there—what matters is whether or not they generate fitted humor.</p>

<p>When we look for it, we’ll notice that we know charming people with a wide variety of personalities. The people who make us feel fitted humor may be any combination of awkward, direct, brusque, careful, flamboyant, focused, forward, generous, impulsive, gruff, kind, loud, premeditative, quiet, sincere, shy, thoughtful, and so on.</p>

<p>As before, we can avoid confusing a means (gruffness) to an ends (fitted humor)—since we also know gruff people who aren’t charming. What matters is the fitted humor.</p>

<p>This is why becoming more charming isn’t an impossible matter of changing our personality, where we become charming all at once. Instead, how charming we are or aren't depends on our ability to observe emotional situations and make small adjustments accordingly.</p>
