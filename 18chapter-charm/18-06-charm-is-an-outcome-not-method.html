    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charm is an outcome not method</h1>   
    
   
  
<p>Charm (fitted humor) is an outcome, not a method. There are many methods to reach the same outcome.</p>

    <div class="consider"> 
     <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
     <p class="considertext">There isn't one way of reaching the post office for everyone. Instead, we adjust how we get there depending on the circumstances and preferences. The best route and means changes person-by-person, even if we end up at the same place.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">In the same way, there isn't one way people are charming. It changes all the time—what's shared between instances of charm is the outcome (fitted humor), not the method.</p>
     </div>

<p>This is why charm attempts aren’t all the same—some charm attempts are abrasive, brusque, conventional, kind, rude, teasing, and so on. That’s because there are many ways reach a particular humor outcome:</p>

<p>For instance, Emma and Zoe are both charming with each other, but the way they go about it is distinctive to them:
    </p>
    
Emma is direct (and uses charm)

<p><narration>Emma knocks on the door of Zoe’s apartment, a coffee cup in either hand.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Hey Zoe! I got you that disgusting tea you like.”</speech> <action>*offers cup*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*eyes light up*</action> <action>*takes it*</action> <speech>“That’s so nice of you!”</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels Emma reveals a personal view, acceptably criticizes, symbolizes close ties, creates rapport, controls a situation, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;Zoe feels acceptance, appreciation, connection, comfort, delight, generosity, joy, release, relief, safety, welcome, and so on)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“I know!”</speech></p>

Zoe is tactful (and uses charm)

<p><narration>Zoe knocks on the door of Emma’s apartment, a coffee cup in either hand.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Hey Emma! I got you that, uh, very interesting iced drink you like.”</speech> *offers cup*</p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*eyes light up* *hand snakes out*</action> <action>*takes it carefully*</action> <speech>“I hate you.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma feels Zoe reveals a personal view, acceptably criticizes, symbolizes close ties, creates rapport, controls a situation, and so on&harr;&#xFE0E;Emma feels acceptance, appreciation, connection, comfort, delight, generosity, joy, release, relief, safety, welcome, and so on)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“I know!”</speech></p>

<p>Even though Emma and Zoe have different tonal methods, they both experience each other’s humor attempt similarly—as charm.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Methods.</headline> We often see charming people who aren’t like us. If we imagine trying to be charming the way those people are charming, we may feel stress or worry about being artificial. But we don’t have to try to be charming the way they are charming—since there are many ways to be charming.</p> 
    
    <p>If a thousand people become better at fitted humor, they’re not all converging toward the same style of being charming. Instead, they’d each be refining their own styles in a way that feels very comfortable to each them.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, if Zoe and Emma both got better at charm, they wouldn’t be converging toward the same methods—just the same outcomes. They’d both end up seeming more like themselves, in a way that felt more comfortable to themselves, not more stressful.</p>
    
    <p>We already know this feeling. When we’re in an unusually good mood, we’re better at generating fitted humor in ourselves or other. We don’t feel like someone else in these moments—we still feel comfortably like ourselves, and it's not stressful. This is what improving our skill at charm feels like—something that isn't stressful and that feels like ourselves.</p>
