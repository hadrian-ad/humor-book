    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charm is an outcome, not a method</h1>   
    
   
  
<p>Charm<callback> (fitted humor)</callback> is an specific <term>outcome</term>, not a specific <em>method</em>. There are many methods to reach the same outcome.</p>

    <div class="for-instance"> 
     <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
     <p class="for-instance-text">If people from across the city come to a venue for a concert, people will arrive at the venue by different routes and different methods of travel. What's shared isn't the route or method, but the destination <callback>(the venue)</callback>.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">In the same way, if different people prioritize fittedness, they'll generate fitted humor by different approaches and methods. What's shared isn't a single approach or method, but the destination <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>.
     </div>

<p>This is why charm attempts aren’t all the same. Since there are many ways to reach a particular humor outcome,
charm attempts can be abrasive, brusque, conventional, generous, kind, rude, teasing, withholding, and so on.</p>

<p>Even though Emma and Zoe have different tonal methods, they both experience each other’s humor attempt similarly—as charm.</p>
