    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charm is an outcome not method</h1>   
    
   
  
<p>Charm<callback> (fitted humor)</callback> is an specific <term>outcome</term>, not a specific <em>method</em>. There are many methods to reach the same outcome.</p>

    <div class="for-instance"> 
     <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
     <p class="for-instance-text">If people from across the city come to a park for a concert, people will arrive at the park by different routes and different methods of travel. What's shared isn't the route or method, by the destination <callback>(the park)</callback>.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">In the same way, if different people prioritize fittedness, they'll generate fitted humor by different approaches and methods. What's shared isn't a single approach or method, but the destination <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>.
     </div>

<p>This is why charm attempts aren’t all the same. Since there are many ways to reach a particular humor outcome,
charm attempts can be abrasive, brusque, conventional, generous, kind, rude, teasing, withholding, and so on.</p>

<p>Even though Emma and Zoe have different tonal methods, they both experience each other’s humor attempt similarly—as charm.</p>

    <p><headline>Comparisons.</headline> If we have a charming friend, it can be exhausting to imagine trying to be charming like they are. But we <term>don't</term> have to try to be charming like they are&mdash;since there are <em>many</em> ways to be charming.</p>
    
    <p>When a thousand people become better at fitted humor, they’re not all converging toward the same style of being charming. Instead, they’d each be refining their own styles in a way that feels very comfortable to each them.</p>

</div>
    
    <p>We already know this feeling. When we’re in an unusually good mood, we’re better at generating fitted humor in ourselves or others. This experience usually feels less like becoming more like someone <term>else</term>, and more like <em>ourselves</em>&mdash;and feels good, not stressful.</p>
