    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charm is an outcome not method</h1>   
    
   
  
<p>Charm <callback>(fitted humor)</callback> is an specific <term>outcome</term>, not a specific <em>method</em>. There are many methods to reach the same outcome.</p>

    <div class="for-instance"> 
     <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
     <p class="for-instance-text">There isn't one way of reaching the post office for everyone. Instead, we adjust how we get there depending on the circumstances and preferences. The exact route and means of travel changes person-by-person, but even so we all still end up at the same place.</p> 
     
     <p class="considertext">In the same way, there isn't one way people are charming. It changes all the time—what's shared between instances of charm is the outcome <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>, not the method.</p>
     </div>

<p>This is why charm attempts aren’t all the same—some charm attempts are abrasive, brusque, conventional, kind, rude, teasing, and so on. That’s because there are many ways reach a particular humor outcome:</p>

<p>For instance, Emma and Zoe are both charming with each other, but the way they go about it is distinctive to them. Emma is <term>direct</term> and Zoe is <em>tactful</em>&mdash;but <sem>both</sem> are prioritizing fittedness <callback>(charm)</callback>:

<p>Even though Emma and Zoe have different tonal methods, they both experience each other’s humor attempt similarly—as charm.</p>

    <p><headline>Comparisons.</headline> If we have a charming friend, it can be exhausting to imagine trying to be charming like they are. But we <term>don't</term> have to try to be charming like they are&mdash;since there are <em>many</em> ways to be charming.</p>
    
    <p>When a thousand people become better at fitted humor, they’re not all converging toward the same style of being charming. Instead, they’d each be refining their own styles in a way that feels very comfortable to each them.</p>

    <p>We already know this feeling. When we’re in an unusually good mood, we’re better at generating fitted humor in ourselves or others. We don’t feel like someone <term>else</term> in these moments—we still feel comfortably like <em>ourselves</em>, and it's not stressful.</p>
