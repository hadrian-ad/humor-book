    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can prioritize fittedness while still not being above dress code</h1>   
    
   

<p>We can make humor attempts that prioritize fittedness&mdash;but that doesn't mean our humor attempts will be above the <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-01-humor-dress-code-marks-when-humor-is-seen-as-justified.html">humor dress code</a>:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to stranger*</action> <speech>“Wow, you’re beautiful. Message me, okay?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Stranger:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“You know I won’t.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“I know. But message me.”</speech></p>
</div>


<p>Elias' humor attempt isn’t focused on intensity—it’s not <term>comedy</term>. Instead, his goal is to reach humor outcomes—it’s <em>charm</em>. Elias wants to <humor-outcome>help himself become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce her defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize himself</humor-outcome>, and so on.
    </p>
    
<p>But even though Elias was prioritizing fittedness, his humor attempt was still below the situation’s humor dress code—since the topics were irrelevant and there’s a high dress code with strangers:</p>

        A laugh doesn’t mean the humor is fitted—it just means the humor was relatively intense. We can’t use the intensity of humor tells to straightforwardly think humor was fitted.
