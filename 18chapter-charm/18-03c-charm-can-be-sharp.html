<p>The word “charm” sometimes makes us think of things that are anodyne, artificial, bland, insincere, saccharine, soft, or so on. But charm attempts occur in all kinds of ways—many of which don’t strike us as saccharine or soft:</p>

    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*cathartic laugh*</action> “Really? Oh no.” <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>

<p>To observers, the content and tone of charm can sometimes seem aggressive, direct, blunt, teasing, and so on—and it’s not until we check intentions and outcomes that we see them as charm attempts:</p>
