    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Making sense of charm</h1>   

  <p>The example with the woman and the priest was an example from spectator entertainment <callback>(a romantic comedy)</callback>&mdash;so we can't take it too straightforwardly as a template for our real-life interactions.</p>
     
<p>At the same time, the scene does capture something we see all across our lives. For instance, we can look at a story someone posted in a forum:<p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma is browsing a forum. One of the topics is a call for strong sexual memories that didn't involve any physical contact.</narration></p>
     
    <p><narration>One catches her eye:</narration></p>
      
       <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Poster:</speaker> I (male) was taking a scuba diving class in my university. There was a stunning redhead with a amazing body. We never spoke in class. Fast forward to the end of the school year. We are diving for 2 days at a lake doing the checkout dives. One day 1 as I am exiting the water she is entering the water and said something to like “hurry up you are holding me up” I have no idea why but my response was “Fuck you” in a playful tone. She smiles and responds “OK”. My mind is blown. Class ends and she said. I’ll see you tomorrow. The next day she did not make it to class because she was involved in a car accident. She had injuries that kept her from diving. So yeah. Never saw her again. It’s been 23 years and I still remember that sexy redhead in the white two piece.
        </p>
</div>
<p>We can relate the diving student's comment to the emotional sitution. He was trying to reach humor outcomes&mdash;to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle her complaint</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on. Since these outcomes were his <sem>priority</sem>, it was a charm attempt&mdash;he wasn't trying to make her laugh for laughter's sake.</p> 

<p>This example is similar to the scene with Fleabag and Hot Priest: both men in these examples made a high-velocity charm attempt <callback>("fuck you")</callback>&mdash;which followed a sentiment of <callback>"don't hold me up."</callback></p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Charm references an outcome <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>, not a way of getting there. Even though "fuck you" reached this outcome in this case, that's no guarantee it would.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">And other actions <callback>(a laugh, wink, gift, and so on)</callback> are all potentially different paths to the same outcome&mdash;all mistakes that could be seen as OK.</p> 
    </div>


<p>And also like with the scene between Fleabag and Hot Priest, we can use humor outcomes and humor family words to make sense of how the people involved saw the situation&mdash;her smile showed <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on, and their <sem-weak>mutual</sem-weak> humor <humor-outcome>created (mutual) rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed (mutual) personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>(mutually) symbolized ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The diving student remembers this high-velocity charm attempt as successful&mdash;which may or may not be how the woman remembers it.</p>
</div>

<p>We don't always have a way of talking or thinking about these moments of humor in our day-to-day life. The poster doesn't say <callback>"something funny happened"</callback> or <callback>"I made a joke"</callback>&mdash;even though the hinge of the story was that she smiled.</p>
  
<p>This happens all across our lives. We notice and talk about humor and humor attempts when the intention is laughter for laughter's sake&mdash;but more complex emotional actions involving humor are ignored. Charm helps us think about all this in a unified way.</p>
      
   <div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">The term the man used was a "playful tone." In this book, "play" is another word for a humor attempt&mdash;when we play, we're trying to intentionally shift mistakes and Oks into balance.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">One problem with the word play is the same with the term "humor attempt"&mdash;they don't indicate anything how one is prioritizing fittedness. We can use words like charm or comedy to formally include this part of a humor attempt. </p>
    </div> 


   

<div class="box">
     <p><headline>Troubleshooting.</headline>     <term>If</term> the diving student's high-velocity charm attempt had been unsuccessful, we could use our components of humor to think about <em>why</em> it was unsuccessful.</p>
    
<p>This involves thinking about the relevancy of the active topics, and whether rushing toward humor outcomes are actually on those topics <callback>(fittedness)</callback>&mdash;relation to efficiency and cohesion <callback>(dress code)</callback>&mdash;and about mistakes and OKs.</p> 
    
    <p>If someone feels a deviation from the expected has risk of negative personal consequences, they'll feel <emotions>danger</emotions> instead of <emotions>safety</emotions>, <emotions>distance</emotions> instead of <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>frustration</emotions> instead of <emotions>delight</emotions>.</p> 
    
    <p>Negative outcomes can help us work backwards to understand starting evaluations and how our actions in context shifted those evaluations. Over time, this develops greater intuitive sensitivity within an emotional situation.</p>

<p>In places and times that low-ranked women, it was generally agreed that most women were inferior to most men in things like civic awareness, courage, intelligence, industry, morality, leadership, rationality—and to boot, women weren’t very funny either. </p>

<p>Of course, it wasn’t just that women weren’t funny—women were the <term>opposite</term> of funny: they were killjoys, nagging, shrewish, shrill, thin-skinned, vain, and so on. But to cover all the bases, women were also seen as the <em>opposite</em> <outcome-contrast>opposite</outcome-contrast> of funny too: too caring, delicate, empathetic, moral, nurturing, observant, sensitive, sentimental, thoughtful, virtuous, and so on. </p>

<p>In other words, those societies saw women as bad at humor from both ends, even in incoherent and contradictory ways.</p>

<p>Through a variety of mechanisms, women in these societies were excluded from major roles in for-profit comedy, including as actors, directors, columnists, comedians, comics, screenwriters, radio jockeys, and so on—which created feedback loops of superficial confirmation of prejudices about women and humor.</p>

<p>In addition, the spectator entertainment that was popular with women-majority demographics was belittled and trivialized, so that the period dramas, romantic comedies, romances, sitcoms, soap operas, and so on that were almost exclusively watched by women weren’t seen as having good or worthwhile humor attempts.</p>

<p>This was in contrast to the spectator entertainment that was also popular with men, which was seen as good&mdash;as having greater authenticity, civic-worth, cultural value, daring, status, vivacity, and so on.</p>

<p>These prejudices—excluding and belittling women—have had a long life. We can see the stereotypes that pretended to justify this exclusion being both mocked and winked at in a in a 2001 episode of <i>Futurama</i>:</p>

<p>In the scene, the men discuss what they use to assess how good humor attempts are. For them, good humor was <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> boring and <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> primarily based on character or realistic situations. In this book, this is loosely similar to a preference for intensity, instead of fittedness.</p> 

<p>Without really ever thinking about it, many of us have absorbed the idea that intensity is the only important&mdash;or even the only possible&mdash;measure of humor. This is why we sometimes think that “good” humor is either gloriously stupid <callback>(“ice to see you”)</callback>, or something that pushes the envelope. <callback>(“I know I’m not supposed to say it, but…”)</callback> We sometimes don’t think there <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> be any other kind of good humor.</p>

<p>There’s obviously nothing wrong with enjoying and celebrating things that prioritize intensity of humor. Instead, the problem comes when we lose the ability to see that other measures of humor exist concurrently. We can maybe feel this ourselves in this chapter, where “charm” is something that’s both incredibly obvious and also hard to wrap our heads around.</p>

<p>All throughout our day-to-day lives, charm has been common, effective, enjoyable, familiar, memorable, normal, nice, powerful, versatile, and so on. Even so, we’ve often never really had a name for it—and it’s frequently been invisible because of it!</p>

<p>But as we start seeing fittedness as existing concurrently with intensity, our ability to use humor will become more capable and in accord to the world around us.</p>

    <div class="content">

<p>Our model of humor has two quantitative values: fittedness and intensity. We can weight these values in different ways when qualifying humor. When we give more weight to intensity than fittedness, we'll call it comedy. When we give more weight to fittedness that intensity, we'll call it charm.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
For people who don't think a measure of humor exists other than intensity, intensity is then given highest weight by default. But when we know we can give<a href="18-01-we-can-prioritize-different-measures-of-humor.html"> more weight to fittedness</a>, we can see a different set humor experiences become "good." This includes low-intensity humor that we <a href="18-03-we-often-feel-low-intensity-humor-but-don't-notice.html">don't always notice</a> as humor until it's pointed out.</li>
    
    <li>Fitted humor is an <a href="18-06-charm-is-an-outcome-not-method.html">outcome</a>, not a method. There are many methods to create fitted humor.
    </li>
    
    <li>We <a href="18-13-we-have-a-preference-for-charm-over-comedy.html">emotionally orient toward fitted humor</a>. For instance, we'll be drawn toward things that make us feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and other humor family words. Over time, this orientation gives us a long-term preference for charm over comedy.</li>
