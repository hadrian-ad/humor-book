    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can prioritize fittedness while still not being above dress code</h1>   
    
   

<p>Even if someone is prioritizing fittedness, that doesn’t mean their humor attempt will be above the <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-01-humor-dress-code-marks-when-humor-is-seen-as-justified.html">humor dress code</a>:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Elias is ordering coffee.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to barista*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“If I could see the clearest skies or your eyes—damn! I’d choose your eyes every time.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Barista:</speaker> <action>*pursing lips*</action> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Here’s your coffee.”</speech></p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to stranger*</action> <speech>“Wow, you’re beautiful. Message me, okay?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Stranger:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“You know I won’t.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“I know. But message me.”</speech></p>
</div>


<p>Elias isn’t focused on intensity—it’s not comedy. Instead, his goal is to reach humor outcomes—it’s charm. Elias wants to <humor-outcome>help himself become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce her defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize himself</humor-outcome>, and so on.
    </p>
    
<p>But even though Elias was prioritizing fittedness, his humor attempt was still below the situation’s humor dress code—since the topics were irrelevant and there’s a high dress code with strangers:</p>

<p>Being unfitted doesn’t mean someone <term>will</term> <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-06-we-feel-itss-justified-to-censure-unfitted-humor.html">censure</a> Elias. It just means that <em>if</em> someone does, people will see the justification for the censure as greater than the justification for the charm.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Someone can <term>feel</term> humor and <em>also</em> justifiably censure us—since intensity and fittedness are two different things.

    <p>We've seen high-velocity humor attempts before, like in the clip from a comedy show:</p> 

<div class="vignette">

<p>We can assemble a description of Hot Priest's comment. <callback>("Fuck you, then.")</callback></p>

<p>First, was it a humor attempt, or a mistake-predominant attempt? <callback>(Did he want her to smile or become angry?)</callback> It was a humor attempt.   

<p>Once we identify it as a humor attempt, we decide whether it was a charm attempt or a comedy attempt. <callback>(Was he prioritizing fittedness, or intensity?)</callback> It was prioritizing fittedness.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Hot Priest's goal wasn't intensity, since how hard Fleabag laughed was less important to him than that she thought he <humor-outcome>supported an argument (that her action wasn't worthwhile to her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport (with her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>became accepted (by her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduced (both of their) defensiveness, revealed a personality trait</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled (her) complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized (her actions)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolized ties (between them)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Because of how clear these descriptions apply to the situation, we can call this humor attempt more specifically a charm attempt.</p>
</div>
 
<p>Finally, we ask if this was a low- or high-velocity charm attempt. <callback>(Was it ambling toward humor outcomes, or rushing for them?)</callback> It was high-velocity.</p>

        <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-10-we-can-prioritize-fittedness-below-dress-code/18-10-1.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 25rem ; margin-left: ">


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">The woman was guarding against humor outcomes, and it took something with high velocity to break through these guards. <callback>("Fuck you, then")</callback></p>
    
    <p class="considertext">These high-velocity comments don't always strike us as humor attempts, since we're used to describing them as something else—as insults, rudeness, teasing, or so on. But we can clarify those descriptions by grounding them to what's actually happening in the emotional situation. <callback>("No matter what else we call it, it was a high-velocity charm attempt.")</callback></p>
</div>

<p>A "high-velocity charm attempt" is the comment's relation to the emotional situation. This is an improvement over descriptions like "joke" or "insult" which are words that don't always relate comments to the emotional situation very well. <callback>("Is a ha-ha insult or a mean insult?")</callback></p>

<p>We said before that high-velocity can get past defenses to reach humor tripwires. But that the same thing that makes high-velocity comments <term>effective</term> makes the consequences of <sem>not</sem> reaching humor tripwires <em>worse</em>.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
<p class="for-instance-text">If Hot Priest had just said <callback>"sorry, just trying to make conversation"</callback>, he probably wouldn't have made the woman smile—but he probably wouldn't create irreparable social damage either. By contrast, <callback>"fuck you"</callback> <term>may</term> make the woman smile—but may cause social damage if it <em>doesn't</em>.</p>
</div>
 
<p>How risky was this comment by the priest? Not particularly&mdash;the priest already has a good idea of what the emotional outcome will be: he has the competence to emotionally forecast that the woman will eventually feel he <humor-outcome>handled her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome> her—and not that he was <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>disgruntled</outcome-contrast> by her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized her</humor-outcome>. The priest had gained this competence through experience and practice.</p>
 
<p>Since this is an example from spectator entertainment <callback>(a romantic comedy)</callback>, we can't take it too straightforwardly as a template for our real-life interactions.</p> 

<p>But at the same time, the clip <sem-weak>does</sem-weak> capture something that we see all across our lives once we know what to look for—moments in our day-to-day life that aren't always easy to record or convey, but are often important to being socially comfortable and effective.</p>

<p>For instance, we can look at a story someone posted in a forum. This story was in response to a call on the forum for strongly sexual memories of people they had never had any physical contact with. He wrote:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>I (male) was taking a scuba diving class in my university. There was a stunning redhead with a amazing body. We never spoke in class. Fast forward to the end of the school year. We are diving for 2 days at a lake doing the checkout dives. One day 1 as I am exiting the water she is entering the water and said something to like “hurry up you are holding me up” I have no idea why but my response was “Fuck you” in a playful tone. She smiles and responds “OK”. My mind is blown. Class ends and she said. I’ll see you tomorrow. The next day she did not make it to class because she was involved in a car accident. She had injuries that kept her from diving. So yeah. Never saw her again. It’s been 23 years and I still remember that sexy redhead in the white two piece.</narration>
        </p>
</div>

<p>We see something similar in this story as in the show. His <callback>"fuck you"</callback> was a high-velocity charm attempt in response to a <callback>"you are holding me up"</callback> sentiment. Like the priest, the diver was trying to reach humor outcomes: <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle her complaint</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">The man said fuck you in a "playful tone." In this book, playful is another word for a humor attempt. When we play, we're trying to intentionally shift mistakes and OKs into balance.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">In this case, the man doesn't sound like he had practice with this kind of comment, but felt a momentary, intuitive understanding of what the outcome would be.</p>
    </div> 
 
<p>Like with the scene between Fleabag and Hot Priest, we can use humor outcomes and humor family words to make sense of how the man saw the situation. He felt her smile showed <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on—and that their <sem-weak>mutual</sem-weak> humor <humor-outcome>created rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolized ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
   
<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">Note that this is how the writer of this anecdote recalls and interpreted the experience, which may or may not be accurate or similar to how the woman remembers it.</p>
