    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Prioritize fittedness doesn't mean we're above dress code</h1>   
    
   

<p>Just because we prioritize fittedness doesn't mean our humor attempts will be above the <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-01-humor-dress-code-marks-when-humor-is-seen-as-justified.html">humor dress code</a>:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Elias is ordering coffee.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to barista*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“If I could see the clearest skies or your eyes&mdash;damn! I’d choose your eyes every time.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Barista:</speaker> <action>*pursing lips*</action> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Here’s your coffee.”</speech></p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to stranger*</action> <speech>“Wow, you’re beautiful. Message me, okay?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Stranger:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“You know I won’t.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“I know. But message me.”</speech></p>
</div>


<p>Elias' humor attempt isn’t focused on intensity&mdash;it’s not a <term>comedy attempt</term>. Instead, his goal is to reach humor outcomes&mdash;it’s a  <em>charm attempt</em>. </p> 
   
   
  <div class="consider"> 
  <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
  <p class="considertext">Elias wants to <humor-outcome>help himself become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce her defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize himself</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p></div>
   
    
<p>But even though Elias was prioritizing fittedness, his humor attempt was still below the situation’s humor dress code&mdash;since the topics were irrelevant and there’s a high dress code with strangers:</p>

<p>Being unfitted doesn’t mean someone <term>will</term> <a href="../17chapter-dress-codes/17-06-we-feel-itss-justified-to-censure-unfitted-humor.html">censure</a> Elias. It just means that <em>if</em> someone does, people will see the justification for the censure as greater than the justification for the charm.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Someone can <term>feel</term> humor and <em>also</em> justifiably <sem>censure</sem> us&mdash;since intensity and fittedness are two different things.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">
        A laugh doesn’t mean the humor is fitted&mdash;it just means the humor was relatively intense. We can’t use the intensity of humor tells by themselves to decide if their humor was fitted.
