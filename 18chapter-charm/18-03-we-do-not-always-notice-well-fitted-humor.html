    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We don't always notice well-fitted humor</h1>   
    
<p>In the same way we don't notice humor on a walk, we don't always notice the fitted humor we feel all across our life, like when we:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>get really great hugs</li>
    <li>step into someone’s house to visit them</li>
    <li>are complimented on our outfit</li>
    <li>hear good news</li>
    <li>greet a friend</li>
    <li>step out from the cold</li>
    <li>get a text from a good friend</li>
    <li>are offered a glass of water</li>
    <li>open a perfect gift</li>
    <li>reconcile with someone after a disagreement</li>
    <li>are served delicious-looking food</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>These are all moments where we evaluate mistakes as OK. Even though it's obvious these are all moments where we <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seek</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increase energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>have active eyes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>become optimistic</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>move non-normatively</humor-tell>, and so on it's often not until it's pointed out that we actually notice this humor <sem>as</sem> humor:</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>Zoe won’t necessarily register this as humor—or even that she laughed. That’s because the humor she feels when she comes home is so well-fitted that she just feels it as one moment unfolding easily into the next&mdash;a bit like how it feels to use stairs and not really notice them:</p>

<p>Often, we don't have a name for well-fitted humor, which makes it hard to talk about. We see that people smile when complimented or laugh at good news.</p>

    <p><narration>Zoe lines up with everyone else to file into the bus. Zoe taps her phone at the farebox when it’s her turn. This always makes her a tiny bit anxious.

</div> 



<p>Despite this humor being decent charm—since it’s relatively fitted—Zoe doesn’t really think to notice this humor until it’s pointed out.</p> 

<p>Low-intensity humor can simultaneously be both there and not noticed&mdash;but once this humor is pointed out, we can't stop noticing this it.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think humor <sem>is</sem> comedy, and so we try to understand all humor in terms of being “comedic.” But that would be odd—a bit like thinking eating <sem>is</sem> restaurants, and then trying to understand all eating in terms of being “restaurantic.”</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">That would be taking something niche that came second <callback>(comedy/restaurants)</callback>, and then trying to use it to back-explain the much wider thing that came first <callback>(humor/eating)</callback>.</p>

<p>If we're prioritizing fittedness, the humor above is good&mdash;and the intensity of humor is neither here nor there.</p>
    
<p>We're often used to only having <term>one</term> measure for humor <callback>(intensity)</callback>. Having only one measure can make discussions of humor seem dimensionless and flat.</p> 

<p>When we add in a <em>second</em> measure <callback>(fittedness)</callback> we create some  depth perception to how we think about humor.</p>


 
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Importance.</headline> We often think of money as having only quantity and no quality. So if we think a pennies and nickles are always "bad" compared to dollars, we'd simply screen out pennies and nickles&mdash;they wouldn't be worth noticing, let alone bending down to pick up.</p>
    
    <p>We sometimes do something similar with humor. We assume a light smile is "bad" compared to a loud laugh&mdash;and so at some point, we stop paying attention to them. Sometimes, we even stop pursuing them, too.</p> 
    
    <p>But humor isn't like money. When we pay attention to the fittedness of our humor, we can track our emotional relation to the world around us—our changing sense of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, and so on. Those experiences and variations are worth noticing and keeping track of, at any intensity.</p>
    

</div>

<!--
    <p>Money has <term>one</term> value of comparison, magnitude. But other things have <em>two</em> values of comparison. For instance, food has taste and size. 
     
<p>We <term>sometimes</term> care most about portion size&mdash;but not <em>always</em>. Sometimes we care more about how it tastes. And we can appreciate tiny portions of food if they taste really, really good.</p> 
      
<p>This is like humor. There are two comparable values: intensity and fittedness. How we prioritize these measures changes situation-by-situation, but fitted moments of humor are worth paying attention to&mdash;even if the intensity never crests into broad smiles and laughter.
