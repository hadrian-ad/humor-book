    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We don't always notice low-intensity humor</h1>   
    
   

<p>To think about how well-fitted humor can be “good” even at a low-intensity, we can imagine walking on the road in the photo below:</p>

            <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-03-we-often-feel-low-intensity-humor-but-do-not-notice-that-we-do/18-03-0-gloomy-walk.jpg

<p>This photo is almost gloomy—it’s not what we’d conventionally think of as relating to humor. At the same time, if we imagine walking there, we may also imagine feeling humor.</p>

<p>To catch this feeling of humor, we can imagine:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>feeling the briskness of late fall air</li>
    <li>smelling wet leaves and pines</li>
    <li>enjoying the use of our legs</li>
    <li>exploring somewhere new</li>
    <li>feeling light mist on our face</li>
    <li>hearing forest birds</li>
    <li>knowing we’ll be able to return to comfort</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>

<p>As we imagine this, we can think about whether we’d:</p>

<div class="list-in-text">
  
   <p class="vig-indent">
       <strong>show humor tells</strong> <callback>(loosening, reducing physical tension, smiling, focus on present, increased agency, optimism, raised spirits, reduction of stress, and so on)</callback>
   </p>

   <p class="vig-indent">
       <strong>reach humor outcomes</strong> <callback>(eased tension, reduced defensiveness, controlled (our own) situation, created rapport (with ourselves or the world), changed negative emotions into positive ones, and so on)</callback>
   </p>

<p class="vig-indent">
    <strong>feel humor family words</strong> <callback>(acceptance, appreciation, connection, delight, insight, release, relief, welcome, and so on)</callback>
</p>

      </div>

<p>We can feel humor while walking there, even if nothing about the place, photo, or walk strikes us as comedic.</p>

<p>While we probably wouldn’t be laughing non-stop <callback>(humor is low-intensity)</callback>, we could describe our humor with humor family words and humor outcomes <callback>(humor has high-fittedness)</callback>.</p>

<p>In this case, the walk would be a good instance of charm, even if it’s an unremarkable instance of comedy.</p>

<p>We can think about charm in other photos too. If we imagine <term>being</term> at these places—not just <em>looking</em> at them—we can think about whether or not we'd feel humor family words or reach humor outcomes:</p>

<p>None of these places were designed to make people chuckle and laugh the entire time. Most of our experiences in these places or moments would be of having low-intensity of humor.</p> 

<p>If we’re judging humor by intensity, the humor we’d feel from being in these pictures would be “bad.” But if we judge by fittedness, we’d see this humor as “good”—and so would be worth noticing and self-monitoring for.</p>

</div>
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Limits.</headline> Sometimes we put arbitrary limits on where we look for humor. We may be used to self-monitoring for humor when we watch a funny reviewer, stand-up artist, slapstick performance, and so on. But we may <sem>not</sem> check ourselves for humor tells when watching dance performances or taking walks—even though dances or walks make us feel humor too.</p>
    
    <p>One of the differences between performed slapstick and a walk is the intensity of humor: we often feel more intense humor at a good comedy routine than we do at a good walk. But this only makes the routine "better" if we're prioritizing intensity.</p>
    
    <p>Walks generate well-fitted, low-intensity humor&mdash;just like ballet, buildings, clothes, sounds, speech, walks, and so on can. If we prioritize fittedness, this humor can be "better."</p>
    
    <p>When we pay attention to  multiple measures of humor, we'll be able to think multi-dimensionally about humor and have multiple methods of comparison. But to do this, we have to think beyond intensity as the only possible measure of "good" humor.</p>
