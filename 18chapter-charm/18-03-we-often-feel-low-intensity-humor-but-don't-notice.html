    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We don't always notice charm</h1>   
    
<p>When we're used to paying attention to intense humor, we don't always notice the fitted humor we feel.</p> 
            
            <p>To think about this, we can imagine walking on the road in the photo below:</p>

            <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-03-we-often-feel-low-intensity-humor-but-do-not-notice-that-we-do/18-03-0-gloomy-walk.jpg

    alt="This photo shows a pleasantly curving road through a fall wood, with forest close on etiher side. There are no leaves on the trees, only bright orange leaves everywhere, and pine trees. The sky is overcast, and the road is lightly wet from rain. The effect is gloomy and beautiful.";
    title="Fall walk";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: 1rem; ">



<p>This photo is almost gloomy&mdash;not what we conventionally associate with humor. But we can imagine feeling humor while we walk here. To catch this humor, we can imagine we're:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>feeling the briskness of late fall air</li>
    <li>smelling wet leaves and pines</li>
    <li>enjoying the use of our legs</li>
    <li>exploring somewhere new</li>
    <li>feeling light mist on our face</li>
    <li>hearing forest birds</li>
    <li>knowing we’ll be able to return to comfort</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>

<p>As all that's happening, can we imagine ourselves:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>showing humor tells?</strong> (<humor-tell>loosening</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reducing physical tension</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>focusing on the present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increasing agency</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>feeling optimism</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>raising our spirits</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>reducing stress</humor-tell>, and so on)</li>
    
    <li><strong>reaching humor outcomes?</strong> (<humor-outcome>easing tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reducing defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>controling (our own) situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport (with ourselves or the world)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>changing negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>, and so on)</li>
    
    <li><strong>feeling humor family words?</strong> (<emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on)</li>
</ul>

<p>Once it's pointed out, it's obvious we could feel humor on this walk!</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We'll feel humor from mistakes and OKs balancing, which happens from a walk just like it does from watching a show. Our evaluations can balance, even if nothing about the place, photo, or walk, strikes us as stereotypically comedic.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">As we feel humor as we walk, we might <humor-tell>focus on the present</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>feel optimistic</humor-tell> with <humor-tell>increased agency</humor-tell>, have <humor-tell>reduced stress</humor-tell>, and so on&mdash;and might <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome> and feel <emotions>release</emotions> and <emotions>relief</emotions>.</p>

</div>

<p>If we feel low-intensity, highly-fitted humor on a walk, is that humor good or bad? The answer changes depending on what we're prioritizing:</p>

    <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-03-we-often-feel-low-intensity-humor-but-do-not-notice-that-we-do/walk-humor.sketchpad.png

    alt="This priorities figure is labeled 'humor on a walk' and has 'good' for fittedness and 'bad' for intensity. An annotation notes that we'll call this humor good or bad depending on the weight we give to either fittedness or intensity.";
    title="Priorities figure";
    style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left: 1rem;">
    

<p>In this case, even if it’s an unremarkable experience of <term>comedy</term>, the walk would be a good experience of <em>charm</em>.</p>

     <p class="considertext">It's the same in our examples. If someone's trying to reach humor outcomes, they may prefer they also laugh and smile broadly. At the same time, that intensity is a bit meaningless if  the humor isn't also fitted. The priority is fittedness&mdash;they're focused on charm.

<p>None of these places were designed to make people chuckle and laugh the entire time. Most of our experiences in these places or moments would be with low-intensity of humor.</p> 

<p>If we’re judging humor by intensity, the humor we’d feel from being in these pictures would be “bad.” But if we judge by fittedness, we’d see this humor as “good”—and so would be worth noticing and self-monitoring for.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Limits.</headline> We sometimes only notice the things we expect to find. So if we only expect to feel humor while watching funny videos, we won't notice the humor we feel while taking nice walks. Of course, once the humor on walks is pointed out, it's obvious!</p> 
    
    <p>One reason we don't notice all the humor we feel is that we're so used to looking for and valuing <sem>intense</sem> humor&mdash;and we don't always even think of low-intensity humor <sem-weak>as</sem-weak> humor.</p>
    
    
<p>But we can learn to pay attention to low-intensity humor&mdash;and realize that some measures can make this low-intensity humor not just present, but also "good."</p>
