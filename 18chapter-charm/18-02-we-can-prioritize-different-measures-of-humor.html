    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can prioritize different measuers of humor</h1>   


<p>Having two measures for humor lets us compare humor or humor attempts in different ways:</p>

    
<ol>
   <li>Since <strong>comedy</strong> prioritizes a measure of <term>intensity</term>, the more intense the humor, the better the comedy. So if we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more intensity is better comedy.</li>

    style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left: 1rem;">
    
    <li>Since <strong>charm</strong> prioritizes a measure <em>fittedness</em>, the more fitted the humor, the better the charm. So if we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more fittedness is better charm.</li>
    </ol>

<p>This lets us take two different humor attempts and compare them:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe gets a few paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“So you finally got your oil shop up and running, hey?”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;<outcome-contrast>higher</outcome-contrast> intensity, <outcome-contrast>lower</outcome-contrast> fittedness compared to next example)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>Zoe gets a few oil paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Thanks Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;<outcome-contrast>lower</outcome-contrast> intensity, <outcome-contrast>higher</outcome-contrast> fittedness compared to previous example)</notes></p>
</div>

<p>Zoe felt humor in both examples above—so which humor attempt was “better?” There’s no single answer! It depends on whether we’re prioritizing fittedness or intensity.</p>

    style="max-width: 19rem; margin-left: 1rem ">

<p>If we’re focusing on the <term>intensity</term> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s <outcome-contrast>pun</outcome-contrast> was better. If we’re instead focusing on the <em>fittedness</em> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s <outcome-contrast>affirmation</outcome-contrast> was better.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Since Brad values being able to make his daughter feel humor, it's helpful for him to recognize that prioritizing <sem-weak>either</sem-weak> intensity or fittedness can lead to humor.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">By realizing that an affirmation can lead to humor, just like a pun, he has more options to make Zoe smile or laugh.</p>

        </div>
            
        
        <p>Sam's small adjustment had higher fittedness <sem>and</sem> higher intensity of humor:</p>

        <p>In this case, whether we were prioritizing fittedness or intensity, one option was better. One was better comedy <sem>and</sem> better charm.</p>

<p>We often feel humor at Aesop fables, but not usually <sem-weak>intense</sem-weak> humor.

<p>To decide on whether these fables are "good," we could focus on how much we laugh <callback>(comedy)</callback>. This is how we might judge puns, burping contests, knock, knock jokes, and so on.</p>

<p>But instead we'll focus on how fitted our humor is <callback>(charm)</callback>. That's because what makes fables good are how fitted we find them&mdash;our favorite fabel is the one that helps us reach humor outcomes and feel humor family words.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">
    What makes a fable different than other kinds of behavioral instruction is a threshold of fitted humor. Fitted humor is one part of how we intuitively  recognize something as a "fable" or not.
    </p>
</div>

  <p>This is different than a joke, where a better delivered joke is one that foremost generates more intense humor <callback>(comedy)</callback>, with the fittedness of secondary importance.</p>
