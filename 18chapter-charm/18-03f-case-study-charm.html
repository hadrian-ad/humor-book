    <p>We've seen high-velocity humor attempts before, like in the clip from a comedy show:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe is watching a comedy show.</narration> </p>
    
    <p><narration>Fleabag is stressed from a family reunion. She steps outside the restaurant to smoke. Hot Priest, one of the dinner guests, steps outside as well.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>"Fellow smoker. Have a spare one?"</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <speech>"Sure."</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <action>*hands him cigarette and lights it*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*takes a drag*</action> <internalaction>(conversationally)</internalaction> <speech>"So does your family get together much, or—?"</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>To destroy the possibility of small talk, Fleabag brusquely heads back inside.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <speech>"Fuck you, then."</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <internalaction>(shocked)</internalaction> <action>*turns to stare at him*</action></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <action>*smiles broadly*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor that seems to defy social physics)</notes> <action>*heads inside*</action></p>
    
    
    <p><narration>Zoe smiles as she watches. They have good chemistry, and she can't wait to see what horrible things befall them this season.</narration></p>

<p>We can assemble a description of Hot Priest's comment. <callback>("Fuck you, then.")</callback></p>

<p>First, was it a humor attempt, or a mistake-predominant attempt? <callback>(Did he want her to smile or become angry?)</callback> It was a humor attempt.   

<p>Once we identify it as a humor attempt, we decide whether it was a charm attempt or a comedy attempt. <callback>(Was he prioritizing fittedness, or intensity?)</callback> It was prioritizing fittedness.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">Hot Priest's goal wasn't intensity, since how hard Fleabag laughed was less important to him than that she thought he <humor-outcome>supported an argument (that her action wasn't worthwhile to her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport (with her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>became accepted (by her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduced (both of their) defensiveness, revealed a personality trait</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled (her) complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized (her actions)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolized ties (between them)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Because of how clear these descriptions apply to the situation, we can call this humor attempt more specifically a charm attempt.</p>
</div>
 
<p>Finally, we ask if this was a low- or high-velocity charm attempt. <callback>(Was it ambling toward humor outcomes, or rushing for them?)</callback> It was high-velocity.</p>

        <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-10-we-can-prioritize-fittedness-below-dress-code/18-10-1.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 25rem ; margin-left: ">


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">The woman was guarding against humor outcomes, and it took something with high velocity to break through these guards. <callback>("Fuck you, then")</callback></p>
    
    <p class="considertext">These high-velocity comments don't always strike us as humor attempts, since we're used to describing them as something else—as insults, rudeness, teasing, or so on. But we can clarify those descriptions by grounding them to what's actually happening in the emotional situation. <callback>("No matter what else we call it, it was a high-velocity charm attempt.")</callback></p>
</div>

<p>A "high-velocity charm attempt" is the comment's relation to the emotional situation. This is an improvement over descriptions like "joke" or "insult" which are words that don't always relate comments to the emotional situation very well. <callback>("Is a ha-ha insult or a mean insult?")</callback></p>

<p>We said before that high-velocity can get past defenses to reach humor tripwires. But that the same thing that makes high-velocity comments <term>effective</term> makes the consequences of <sem>not</sem> reaching humor tripwires <em>worse</em>.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
<p class="for-instance-text">If Hot Priest had just said <callback>"sorry, just trying to make conversation"</callback>, he probably wouldn't have made the woman smile—but he probably wouldn't create irreparable social damage either. By contrast, <callback>"fuck you"</callback> <term>may</term> make the woman smile—but may cause social damage if it <em>doesn't</em>.</p>
</div>
 
<p>How risky was this comment by the priest? Not particularly&mdash;the priest already has a good idea of what the emotional outcome will be: he has the competence to emotionally forecast that the woman will eventually feel he <humor-outcome>handled her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome> her—and not that he was <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>disgruntled</outcome-contrast> by her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized her</humor-outcome>. The priest had gained this competence through experience and practice.</p>
 
<p>Since this is an example from spectator entertainment <callback>(a romantic comedy)</callback>, we can't take it too straightforwardly as a template for our real-life interactions.</p> 

<p>But at the same time, the clip <sem-weak>does</sem-weak> capture something that we see all across our lives once we know what to look for—moments in our day-to-day life that aren't always easy to record or convey, but are often important to being socially comfortable and effective.</p>

<p>For instance, we can look at a story someone posted in a forum. This story was in response to a call on the forum for strongly sexual memories of people they had never had any physical contact with. He wrote:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>I (male) was taking a scuba diving class in my university. There was a stunning redhead with a amazing body. We never spoke in class. Fast forward to the end of the school year. We are diving for 2 days at a lake doing the checkout dives. One day 1 as I am exiting the water she is entering the water and said something to like “hurry up you are holding me up” I have no idea why but my response was “Fuck you” in a playful tone. She smiles and responds “OK”. My mind is blown. Class ends and she said. I’ll see you tomorrow. The next day she did not make it to class because she was involved in a car accident. She had injuries that kept her from diving. So yeah. Never saw her again. It’s been 23 years and I still remember that sexy redhead in the white two piece.</narration>
        </p>
</div>

<p>We see something similar in this story as in the show. His <callback>"fuck you"</callback> was a high-velocity charm attempt in response to a <callback>"you are holding me up"</callback> sentiment. Like the priest, the diver was trying to reach humor outcomes: <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle her complaint</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">The man said fuck you in a "playful tone." In this book, playful is another word for a humor attempt. When we play, we're trying to intentionally shift mistakes and OKs into balance.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">In this case, the man doesn't sound like he had practice with this kind of comment, but felt a momentary, intuitive understanding of what the outcome would be.</p>
    </div> 
 
<p>Like with the scene between Fleabag and Hot Priest, we can use humor outcomes and humor family words to make sense of how the man saw the situation. He felt her smile showed <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on—and that their <sem-weak>mutual</sem-weak> humor <humor-outcome>created rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolized ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
   
<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       <p class="considertext">Note that this is how the writer of this anecdote recalls and interpreted the experience, which may or may not be accurate or similar to how the woman remembers it.</p>

    A deeper look (Are women funny?)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">
    
     
<p>In places and times that low-ranked women, it was generally agreed that most women were inferior to most men in things like civic awareness, courage, intelligence, industry, morality, leadership, rationality—and to boot, women weren’t very funny either. </p>

<p>Of course, it wasn’t just that women weren’t funny—women were the <term>opposite</term> of funny: they were killjoys, nagging, shrewish, shrill, thin-skinned, vain, and so on. But to cover all the bases, women were also seen as the <em>opposite</em> <outcome-contrast>opposite</outcome-contrast> of funny too: too caring, delicate, empathetic, moral, nurturing, observant, sensitive, sentimental, thoughtful, virtuous, and so on. </p>

<p>In other words, those societies saw women as bad at humor from both ends, even in incoherent and contradictory ways.</p>

<p>Through a variety of mechanisms, women in these societies were excluded from major roles in for-profit comedy, including as actors, directors, columnists, comedians, comics, screenwriters, radio jockeys, and so on—which created feedback loops of superficial confirmation of prejudices about women and humor.</p>

<p>In addition, the spectator entertainment that was popular with women-majority demographics was belittled and trivialized, so that the period dramas, romantic comedies, romances, sitcoms, soap operas, and so on that were almost exclusively watched by women weren’t seen as having good or worthwhile humor attempts.</p>

<p>This was in contrast to the spectator entertainment that was also popular with men, which was seen as good&mdash;as having greater authenticity, civic-worth, cultural value, daring, status, vivacity, and so on.</p>

<p>These prejudices—excluding and belittling women—have had a long life. We can see the stereotypes that pretended to justify this exclusion being both mocked and winked at in a in a 2001 episode of <i>Futurama</i>:</p>

<p>In the scene, the men discuss what they use to assess how good humor attempts are. For them, good humor was <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> boring and <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> primarily based on character or realistic situations. In this book, this is loosely similar to a preference for intensity, instead of fittedness.</p> 

<p>Without really ever thinking about it, many of us have absorbed the idea that intensity is the only important&mdash;or even the only possible&mdash;measure of humor. This is why we sometimes think that “good” humor is either gloriously stupid <callback>(“ice to see you”)</callback>, or something that pushes the envelope. <callback>(“I know I’m not supposed to say it, but…”)</callback> We sometimes don’t think there <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> be any other kind of good humor.</p>

<p>There’s obviously nothing wrong with enjoying and celebrating things that prioritize intensity of humor. Instead, the problem comes when we lose the ability to see that other measures of humor exist concurrently. We can maybe feel this ourselves in this chapter, where “charm” is something that’s both incredibly obvious and also hard to wrap our heads around.</p>

<p>All throughout our day-to-day lives, charm has been common, effective, enjoyable, familiar, memorable, normal, nice, powerful, versatile, and so on. Even so, we’ve often never really had a name for it—and it’s frequently been invisible because of it!</p>

<p>But as we start seeing fittedness as existing concurrently with intensity, our ability to use humor will become more capable and in accord to the world around us.</p>

    <div class="content">

<p>Our model of humor has two quantitative values: fittedness and intensity. We can weight these values in different ways when qualifying humor. When we give more weight to intensity than fittedness, we'll call it comedy. When we give more weight to fittedness that intensity, we'll call it charm.
</p>


<ul>
    <li>
For people who don't think a measure of humor exists other than intensity, intensity is then given highest weight by default. But when we know we can give<a href="18-01-we-can-prioritize-different-measures-of-humor.html"> more weight to fittedness</a>, we can see a different set humor experiences become "good." This includes low-intensity humor that we <a href="18-03-we-often-feel-low-intensity-humor-but-don't-notice.html">don't always notice</a> as humor until it's pointed out.</li>
    
    <li>Fitted humor is an <a href="18-06-charm-is-an-outcome-not-method.html">outcome</a>, not a method. There are many methods to create fitted humor.
    </li>
    
    <li>We <a href="18-13-we-have-a-preference-for-charm-over-comedy.html">emotionally orient toward fitted humor</a>. For instance, we'll be drawn toward things that make us feel <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and other humor family words. Over time, this orientation gives us a long-term preference for charm over comedy.</li>
