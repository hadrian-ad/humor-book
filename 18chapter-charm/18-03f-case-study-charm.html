    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Case study of charm</h1>   
    
    <p>We can put everything together to see how we can  describe a scene that includes humor and a humor attempt:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe is watching a comedy show.</narration> </p>
    
    <p><narration>Fleabag is stressed from a family reunion. She steps outside the restaurant to smoke. Hot Priest, one of the dinner guests, steps outside as well.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>"Fellow smoker. Have a spare one?"</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <speech>"Sure."</speech> <action>*smiles*</action> <action>*hands him cigarette and lights it*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*takes a drag*</action> <internalaction>(conversationally)</internalaction> <speech>"So does your family get together much, or—?"</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>To destroy the possibility of small talk, Fleabag brusquely heads back inside.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <speech>"Fuck you, then."</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <internalaction>(shocked)</internalaction> <action>*turns to stare at him*</action></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> <action>*smiles broadly*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor that seems to defy social physics)</notes> <action>*heads inside*</action></p>
    
    
    <p><narration>Zoe smiles as she watches. They have good chemistry, and she can't wait to see what horrible things befall them this season.</narration></p>
    </div>

<p>We can assemble a description of Hot Priest's comment. <callback>("Fuck you, then.")</callback></p>

<p>First, was it a humor attempt, or a mistake-predominant attempt? <callback>(Did he want her to smile or become angry?)</callback> It was a humor attempt.   

<p>Once we identify it as a humor attempt, we decide whether it was a charm attempt or a comedy attempt. <callback>(Was he prioritizing fittedness, or intensity?)</callback> It was prioritizing fittedness.</p>
 
<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We know the priest's goal was to prioritize fittedness, not intensity. He foremost wanted to reach humor outcomes, like for her to think he <humor-outcome>supported an argument (that her action wasn't worthwhile)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport (with her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>became accepted (by her)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduced (both of their) defensiveness, revealed a personality trait</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled (her) complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized (her actions)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolized ties (between them)</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">Whether she laughs or just smiles isn't as relevant as whether or not she reaches these humor outcomes on relevant topics.</p>
</div>
 
<p>Finally, we ask if this was a low- or high-velocity charm attempt. <callback>(Was the priest ambling toward humor outcomes, or rushing for them?)</callback> It was high-velocity.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">The woman was guarding against humor outcomes. It took something with high velocity to break through these guards. <callback>("Fuck you, then.")</callback></p>
</div>

<p>This lets us assemble a description of the priest's action in this scene: it was a successful <sem>high-velocity charm attempt</sem>:</p>

        <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-10-we-can-prioritize-fittedness-below-dress-code/18-10-1.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 25rem ; margin-left: ">

<p>This describes the comment's relation to the emotional situation, without getting distracted by surface descriptions of content.</p>



<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">We often describe high-velocity charm attempts as insults, rudeness, teasing, and so on&mdash;words that don't always specificy an intention. <callback>("Is a ha-ha insult or a mean insult?")</callback></p>
        
        <p class="considertext">These words aren't always as necessary as they seem at first. We can ground comments to both their intention and to what actually happens in an emotional situation. <callback>("No matter what else we call it, it was a high-velocity charm attempt&mdash;and it was successful.")</callback></p>
       </div>
<!--

<p>We said before that high-velocity can get past defenses to reach humor tripwires. But that the same thing that makes high-velocity comments <term>effective</term> makes the consequences of <sem>not</sem> reaching humor tripwires <em>worse</em>.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
<p class="for-instance-text">If Hot Priest had just said <callback>"sorry, just trying to make conversation"</callback>, he probably wouldn't have made the woman smile—but he probably wouldn't create irreparable social damage either. By contrast, <callback>"fuck you"</callback> <term>may</term> make the woman smile—but may cause social damage if it <em>doesn't</em>.</p>
</div>
 
<p>How risky was this comment by the priest? Not particularly&mdash;the priest already has a good idea of what the emotional outcome will be: he has the competence to emotionally forecast that the woman will eventually feel he <humor-outcome>handled her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome> her—and not that he was <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>disgruntled</outcome-contrast> by her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized her</humor-outcome>. The priest had gained this competence through experience and practice.</p>
