    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">A second case study of charm</h2>   

  <p>We can look at another, similar instance&mdash;this time from a memory, not from a romantic comedy:<p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Emma is browsing a forum. One of the topics is a call for strong sexual memories of someone you never had any physical contact with.</narration></p>
     
    <p><narration>She reads one of the most popular ones:</narration></p>
      
       <p class="bookquote"><speaker>Poster:</speaker> I (male) was taking a scuba diving class in my university. There was a stunning redhead with a amazing body. We never spoke in class. Fast forward to the end of the school year. We are diving for 2 days at a lake doing the checkout dives. One day 1 as I am exiting the water she is entering the water and said something to like “hurry up you are holding me up” I have no idea why but my response was “Fuck you” in a playful tone. She smiles and responds “OK”. My mind is blown. Class ends and she said. I’ll see you tomorrow. The next day she did not make it to class because she was involved in a car accident. She had injuries that kept her from diving. So yeah. Never saw her again. It’s been 23 years and I still remember that sexy redhead in the white two piece.
        </p>
</div>

<p>This example is similar to the scene with the priest: both women in these examples had a similar sentiment <callback>("don't hold me up")</callback>, which was followed by a high-velocity charm attempt. <callback>("Fuck you")</callback></p> 

<p>As before, we can relate the diving student's comment to the emotional sitution. He wasn't trying to make her laugh for laughter's sake&mdash;it was to reach humor outcomes. He wanted to <humor-outcome>create rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handle her complaint</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, and so on. Since these outcomes were his <sem-weak>priority</sem-weak>, it was a charm attempt.</p> 



<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>Charm references an outcome <callback>(fitted humor)</callback>, not a way of getting there. So even though this specific delivery of "fuck you" generated fitted humor in <sem-weak>this</sem-weak> case, that's no guarantee it would in others.</p> 
    
    <p>Moreover, a sharp comment isn't the only possible thing that would generate humor. We could imagine a laugh, wink, gift, and so on as all potentially being different paths to the same outcome&mdash;since all those things could lead to moments where evaluations were balanced.</p> 
    </div>


<p>And also like with the spectator entertainment scene, we can use humor outcomes and humor family words to make sense of how the the diving students saw the situation&mdash;her smile showed <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on, and their <sem-weak>mutual</sem-weak> humor <humor-outcome>created (mutual) rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed (mutual) personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>(mutually) symbolized ties</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider: </p>
    
    <p>The diving student remembers this high-velocity charm attempt as successful&mdash;which may or may not be how the woman remembers it.</p>
</div>

<p>We don't always have a way of talking or thinking about these moments of humor in our day-to-day life. The poster doesn't say <callback>"something funny happened"</callback> or <callback>"I made a joke"</callback>&mdash;even though the hinge of the story was that she smiled.</p>
  
<p>All across our lives, we tend to talk about humor and humor attempts when the intention is laughter for laughter's sake&mdash;even as we ignore or don't know how to talk about more complex emotional actions that involve humor. Charm helps us expand where and how we think about humor.</p>
      
   <div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>
    <p>The man indicated a humor attempt in his story by describing his "playful tone." In this book, "play" is another way of indicating a humor attempt, since when we play, we're trying to intentionally shift mistakes and Oks into balance.</p> 
    
    <p>But this gives play the same problem as "humor attempt"&mdash;it doesn't indicate priorities. To formally specify, we can characterize these humor attempts with words like charm or comedy.</p>
    </div> 


   
<aside class="box">
    <p><headline>Troubleshooting.</headline>     <term>If</term> the diving student's high-velocity charm attempt had been unsuccessful, we could use our components of humor to think about <term2>why</term2> it was unsuccessful. This involves thinking about:</p>
        
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>the relevancy of the active topics</li>
      
        <li>whether the humor outcome being rushed was actually on a relevant topics</li>
      
        <li>how rushing those topics relates  to efficiency and cohesion</li>
    </ul>
      
      <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
       
    <p>We can also just think about mistakes and OKs. If someone feels a deviation from the expected <callback>(mistake)</callback> has risk of negative personal consequences <callback>(not OK)</callback>, they'll feel:</p>
       
    <ul class="close-list">
        <li>
            <emotions>danger</emotions> instead of <emotions>safety</emotions>
        </li>
            <li>
           <emotions>distance</emotions> instead of <emotions>closeness</emotions>
            </li>
        <li><emotions>frustration</emotions> instead of <emotions>delight</emotions> </li>
    </ul>
        
        <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
        
        <p>Negative outcomes can help us work backwards to understand starting evaluations, and how our actions in context shifted those evaluations. If someone felt <emotions>danger</emotions>, how could that have been reduced? If someone felt <emotions>distance</emotions>, how could other parts of the humor attempt have indicated <emotions>closeness</emotions>? And so on.</p>
        
        <p>Over time, this develops greater intuitive sensitivity in different emotional situations.</p>

<div class="content-example">
    
     
<p>In places and times that low-ranked women, it was generally agreed that most women were inferior to most men in things like civic awareness, courage, intelligence, industry, morality, leadership, rationality&mdash;and to boot, women weren’t very funny either. </p>

<p>Of course, it wasn’t just that women weren’t funny&mdash;women were the <term>opposite</term> of funny: they were killjoys, nagging, shrewish, shrill, thin-skinned, vain, and so on. But to cover all the bases, women were also seen as the <term2>opposite</term2> <outcome-contrast>opposite</outcome-contrast> of funny too: too caring, delicate, empathetic, moral, nurturing, observant, sensitive, sentimental, thoughtful, virtuous, and so on. </p>

<p>In other words, those societies saw women as bad at humor from both ends, even in incoherent and contradictory ways.</p>

<p>Through a variety of mechanisms, women in these societies were excluded from major roles in for-profit spectator entertainment, including as actors, directors, columnists, comedians, comics, screenwriters, radio jockeys, and so on&mdash;which created feedback loops of superficial confirmation of prejudices about women and humor.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <consider>Consider:</consider>
    
    <p>In addition, the spectator entertainment that was popular with women-majority demographics was belittled and trivialized, so that the period dramas, romantic comedies, romances, sitcoms, soap operas, and so on that were almost exclusively watched by women weren’t seen as having good or worthwhile humor attempts.</p>
    
    <p>This was in contrast to the spectator entertainment that was also popular with men, which was seen as good&mdash;as having greater authenticity, civic-worth, cultural value, daring, status, vivacity, and so on.</p>
</div>

<p>The prejudices that led to excluding and belittling women have had a long life. We can see the stereotypes that pretended to justify this exclusion being both mocked and winked at in a in a 2001 episode of <i>Futurama</i>:</p>

<p>In the scene, the men discuss what they use to assess how good humor attempts are. For them, good humor was <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> boring and <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> primarily based on character or realistic situations. In this book, this is loosely similar to a preference for intensity, instead of fittedness.</p> 

<p>Without really ever thinking about it, many of us have absorbed the idea that intensity is the only important&mdash;or even the only possible&mdash;measure of humor. This is why we sometimes think that “good” humor is either gloriously stupid <callback>(“ice to see you”)</callback>, or something that pushes the envelope. <callback>(“I know I’m not supposed to say it, but…”)</callback> We sometimes don’t think there <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> be any other kind of good humor.</p>

<p>There’s obviously nothing wrong with enjoying and celebrating things that prioritize intensity of humor. Instead, the problem comes when we lose the ability to see that other measures of humor exist&mdash;and can exist concurrently. We can maybe feel this ourselves in this chapter, where “charm” is something that’s both incredibly obvious and also hard to wrap our heads around.</p>

<p>All throughout our day-to-day lives, charm has been common, effective, enjoyable, familiar, memorable, normal, nice, powerful, versatile, and so on. Even so, we’ve often never really had a name for it&mdash;and it’s frequently been invisible because of it!</p>

<p>But as we start seeing fittedness as existing concurrently with intensity, our ability to use humor will become more capable and more in accord to the world around us.</p>

    <div class="content">

<p>Humor and humor attempts have two values: intensity and fittedness. We can weight these values in different ways. This gives us a variety of ways to judge and compare humor and humor attempts. 
</p>


<ul>
<li>We can give more weight to intensity <callback>(comedy)</callback> or to fittedness <callback>(charm)</callback>.</li>
   
    <li>
    We often ignore low-intensity humor. But if we weight fittedness highly, low-intensity humor can become more significant.</li>
    
    <li>Fitted humor is an <a href="18-06-charm-is-an-outcome-not-method.html">outcome</a>, not a method. There are many methods to create fitted humor.
