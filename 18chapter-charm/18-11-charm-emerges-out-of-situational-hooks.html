    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Charm emerges out of situational hooks</h1>   
      
 <p>Charm unfolds easily out of situational hooks. If someone feels nervous, we can try to make them feel comfort or safety—if someone mentions an achievement, we help them feel achievement—and so on. This can guide our charm.</p>

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">We saw hooks used this way in a previous chapter, when Sam gave his long speech to the drama team. When Sam talked about an accomplishment, he wanted them to feel an accomplishment; when he’d noticed a moment where reconciliation would be appropriate, he’d apologize. These hooks cued him where and how to generate fitted humor, which led to one version of his speech being more charming than the other.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>We can see Zoe do this when an old friend comes to visit her. Zoe will keep an eye out for hooks throughout the conversation. She’ll then try to press toward the most relevant humor family word. So Zoe might:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>welcome Sara when she arrives</li>
    <li>appreciate that she’s come</li>
    <li>ask about what she’s done and react to it as an accomplishment</li>
    <li>reframe what she learns from Sara as insight or realization</li>
    <li>help her get comfortable</li>
    <li>show acceptance or forgiveness to anything she brings up</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>When Zoe is consistently charming, their interactions will be filled with humor—even if Zoe doesn’t use a single joke:</p>

 

<p><narration>Zoe gets a text from Sara and runs down to the apartment lobby to meet her.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Sara! You’re here!”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <internalaction>(awkwardly)</internalaction> <speech>“I am here!”</speech></p>

<p><narration>Zoe and Sara have pre-hug confusion.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(pushing forward)</internalaction> <speech>“Hugs!”</speech> <action>*hugs Sara*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <internalaction>(awkwardly)</internalaction> <action>*small smile*</action> <speech>“Yes!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Sara feels closeness&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*leading her to elevator*</action> <narration>“Come on up, my apartment is your apartment—I want you to be as comfortable as possible while you’re here.”</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe tries to make Sara feel welcome)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <narration>“Thanks, I really appreciate it. Thanks for letting me spend the night.”</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sara doesn’t feel welcome&harr;&#xFE0E;no humor)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <narration>“No, it’s my pleasure. It’s just so good to see you again!”</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;Sara feels welcome&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> “It’s good to see you too!”</p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <narration>“I see your videos all the time, but it’s just not the same! Even though your comedy’s as perfect as ever.”</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe tries to make Sara feel appreciation and accomplishment)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <narration>“Well. Thanks.”</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sara feels appreciated&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <narration>“So what’s Maryland like? You settling in there?”</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <narration>“Yeah, I think so. I’m running afterschool programs there.”</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <narration>“Oh! I didn’t know that!”</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels realization&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <narration>“Yeah. It’s… less bad than I thought it would be.”</narration> <action>*laughs*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels insight&harr;&#xFE0E;humor)</notes> <narration>“Hence that bit about the playground antics of the bread-eaters!”</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <narration>“Oh yeah!”</narration></p>

<p>Zoe’s goal is for Sara to experience welcome—not just feel that she’s “technically” welcome. That means Zoe has to keep an eye out for humor tells. The humor tells will let Zoe know if her welcomes are helping Sara feel welcome.</p>
