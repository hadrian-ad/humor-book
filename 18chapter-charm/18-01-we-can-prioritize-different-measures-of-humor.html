    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can prioritize different measuers of humor</h1>   
    
   

<p>What makes humor “good?” This depends on whether we’re prioritizing intensity or fittedness:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>intensity</strong>, humor is better the more intense it is.</li>
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>fittedness</strong>, humor is better the more it fits the emotional situation.</li> 
    </ul>

<p>In this book, when we prioritize <term>intensity</term>, we'll call it <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;when we prioritizing <em>fittedness</em> we'll call it <vocab>charm</vocab>:</p>


<ol>
   <li><strong>Comedy</strong> prioritizes a measure of <term>intensity</term>—the more intense the humor, the better the comedy. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more intensity is better comedy.</li>

    <li><strong>Charm</strong> prioritizes a measure <em>fittedness</em>—the more fitted the humor, the better the charm. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more fittedness is better charm.</li>

<p>Having two measures for humor lets us think about instances of humor in different ways:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe gets a few paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“So you finally got your oil shop up and running, hey?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel intense humor&harr;&#xFE0E;<term>comedy</term>)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>Zoe gets a few oil paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel accomplishment&harr;&#xFE0E;<em>charm</em>)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Thanks Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>

<p>Zoe felt humor in both examples above—so which humor attempt was “better?” There’s no single answer! It depends on whether we’re prioritizing fittedness or intensity.</p>

<p>If we’re focusing on the <term>intensity</term> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s pun was better. If we’re instead focusing on the <em>fittedness</em> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s affirmation was better.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Since Brad values making his daughter feel humor, it’s helpful for him to recognize that both charm and comedy lead to humor. This gives him more options to reach the same outcome—making Zoe smile or laugh.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Better.</headline> Sometimes, humor attempts are better at <sem-weak>both</sem-weak> measures. We saw this with Sam’s prelude to the drama team. <callback>(“you guys are lucky to have so much talent…”)</callback> A small adjustment had both higher fittedness <sem>and</sem> led to higher intensity of humor:</p>

    <p>In this case, one of Sam’s humor attempts was better comedy <sem-weak>and</sem-weak> better charm. One option was better no matter which measure we prioritized.</p>

<p>We often feel humor at Aesop fables, but not usually <sem-weak>intense</sem-weak> humor. In that sense, these fables are "bad" at generating humor if we're prioritizing intensity <callback>(comedy)</callback> but "good" at generating humor if we're prioritizing fittedness <callback>(charm)</callback>:

<p>If we feel the fables  <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gave new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>dealt with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, and so on&mdash;we'll feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on&mdash;and so we'll <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>feel optimism</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>have active eyes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>want to seek others</humor-tell>, and so on.</p>

<p>To decide on whether these fables are "good," we could focus on how much we laugh <callback>(comedy)</callback>. This is how we might judge puns, burping contests, knock, knock jokes, and so on.</p>

<p>But instead we'll focus on how fitted our humor is <callback>(charm)</callback>. That's because what makes fables good are how fitted we find them&mdash;our favorite fabel is the one that helps us reach humor outcomes and feel humor family words.</p>

<!--
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">
    What makes a fable different than other kinds of behavioral instruction is a threshold of fitted humor. Fitted humor is one part of how we intuitively  recognize something as a "fable" or not.
    </p>
</div>

  <p>This is different than a joke, where a better delivered joke is one that foremost generates more intense humor <callback>(comedy)</callback>, with the fittedness of secondary importance.</p>
