<p>What makes humor “good?” This depends on whether we’re prioritizing intensity or fittedness:</p>

<ul>
    <li>If we prioritize intensity, then the more intensely we feel humor, the better the humor.</li>
    <li>If we prioritize fittedness, then the more the humor fits the moment, the better the humor.</li> 
    </ul>

<p>In this book, we’re callling prioritizing intensity “comedy,” and prioritizing fittedness “charm:”</p>


<ol>
   <li>Comedy prioritizes a measure of intensity—the more intense the humor, the better the comedy. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more intensity is better comedy.</li>
    
    <li>Charm prioritizes a measure fittedness—the more fitted the humor, the better the charm. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more fittedness is better charm.</li>
    </ol>


<p>Having two measures for humor lets us think about instances of humor in different ways:</p>

Comedy (priority is intensity)

<p><narration>Zoe gets a few paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“So you finally got your oil shop up and running, hey?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel intense humor)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>

<p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>

<p>Charm (priority is fittedness)
    <narration>Zoe gets a few oil paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel accomplishment)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Thanks Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>



<p>Zoe felt humor in both examples above—so which humor attempt was “better?” There’s no single answer—it depends on whether we’re prioritizing fittedness or intensity.</p>

<p>If we’re focusing on the intensity of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s pun was better. If we’re instead focusing on the fittedness of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s affirmation was better.</p>

<p class="consider">Consider:</p>

<p class="considertext">Since Brad values making his daughter feel humor, it’s helpful for him to recognize that both charm and comedy lead to humor. This gives him more options to reach the same outcome—making Zoe smile or laugh.</p>



 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Better.</headline> Sometimes, humor attempts are better at both measures. We saw this with Sam’s prelude to the drama team (“you guys are lucky to have so much talent…”), which had both higher fittedness and higher intensity of humor:</p> 
    
    
    <p>In this case, one of Sam’s humor attempts was better comedy and better charm than another. One option was better no matter which measure we prioritized.</p>
