    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can prioritize different measuers of humor</h1>   
    
   

<p>What makes humor “good?” This depends on whether we’re prioritizing intensity or fittedness:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>intensity</strong>, humor is better the more intense it is.</li>
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>fittedness</strong>, humor is better the more it fits the emotional situation.</li> 
    </ul>

<p>In this book, when we prioritize <term>intensity</term>, we'll call it <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;when we prioritizing <em>fittedness</em> we'll call it <vocab>charm</vocab>:</p>


<ol>
   <li><strong>Comedy</strong> prioritizes a measure of <term>intensity</term>—the more intense the humor, the better the comedy. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more intensity is better comedy.</li>

    <li><strong>Charm</strong> prioritizes a measure <em>fittedness</em>—the more fitted the humor, the better the charm. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more fittedness is better charm.</li>

<p>Having two measures for humor lets us think about instances of humor in different ways:</p>

    <p><narration>Zoe gets a few paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“So you finally got your oil shop up and running, hey?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel intense humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>

<p>Zoe felt humor in both examples above—so which humor attempt was “better?” There’s no single answer! It depends on whether we’re prioritizing fittedness or intensity.</p>

<p>If we’re focusing on the <term>intensity</term> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s pun was better. If we’re instead focusing on the <em>fittedness</em> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s affirmation was better.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Since Brad values making his daughter feel humor, it’s helpful for him to recognize that both charm and comedy lead to humor. This gives him more options to reach the same outcome—making Zoe smile or laugh.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Better.</headline> Sometimes, humor attempts are better at <sem-weak>both</sem-weak> measures. We saw this with Sam’s prelude to the drama team <callback>(“you guys are lucky to have so much talent…”)</callback>, which had both higher fittedness <sem>and</sem> higher intensity of humor:</p>

    <p>In this case, one of Sam’s humor attempts was better comedy <sem-weak>and</sem-weak> better charm. One option was better no matter which measure we prioritized.</p>

<p>We often feel humor when we come across Aesop fables. But what makes a "good" experience reading a fable: <term>intensity</term> of humor <callback>(comedy)</callback>, or <em>fittedness</em> of that humor <callback>(charm)</callback>? It's fittedness!</p>

<p>Fittedness is what makes a fable a fable. We compare how "good" fables are to each other by whether we feel a fable <humor-outcome>supports an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gives new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deals with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizes</humor-outcome>:</p>

    <strong>The Wolf and the Lamb</strong>

        <narration>A wolf came upon a lamb and wanted to eat it, but felt he should give an excuse first.</narration>
    </p> 
    
     <p><speaker>Wolf:</speaker> <speech>"Why, last year you grossly insulted me."</speech></p> 
    <p><speaker>Lamb:</speaker> <speech>"That's impossible, sir, for I wasn't born then."</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Wolf:</speaker> <speech>"Well, you continually feed in my pastures and steel my fodder."</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Lamb:</speaker> <speech>"That can't be, sir, for I haven't yet drunk anything but my mother's milk."</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Wolf:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>"Look, I'm not going without my dinner"</speech></p>
    <p><narration>And so the wolf sprang upon the lamb and devoured it without more ado.</narration></p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
     <p>
        <strong>The Wolf and the Lion</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>A wolf stole a lamb from the flock, and carried it off to devour it at his leisure. But along the way, the wolf met a lion.</narration> <speech>"I'll take that lamb,"</speech> <narration>the lion said. The wolf didn't dare to resist, but as the lion was walking away, the wolf spoke his frustration.</narration>
    </p>
    <p><speaker>Wolf:</speaker> <internalaction>(frustrated)</internalaction> <speech>"It's most unjust of you to take what's mine away from me like that."</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Lion:</speaker> <action>.*laughing*</action> <speech>"It was justly yours, no doubt! The gift of a friend, perhaps, eh?"</speech></p></div>

<p>People find Aesop fables meaningful when they feel low-intensity humor from them. The humor is often the critical element to them, and what makes fables different from other kinds of instructions.</p>

<p>If we read several fables, we'd pick our favorite by which generated the most fitted humor. We used fittedness to assign preference. <callback>(Charm.)</callback>


<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We want fables to be  used in moments that maximize how much it <humor-outcome>supports an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>gives new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deals with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizes</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>helps us achieve catharsis</humor-outcome>, and so on—as well as on maximizing feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on.</p>

  <p>This is different than a joke, where a better delivered joke is one that foremost generates more intense humor <callback>(comedy)</callback>, with the fittedness of secondary importance.</p>
