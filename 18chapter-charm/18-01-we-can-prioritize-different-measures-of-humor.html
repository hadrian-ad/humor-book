    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can prioritize different measuers of humor</h1>   
    
   

<p>What makes humor “good?” This depends on whether we’re prioritizing intensity or fittedness:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>intensity</strong>, then the more intensely we feel humor, the better the humor.</li>
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>fittedness</strong>, then the more the humor fits the moment, the better the humor.</li> 
    </ul>

<p>In this book, we’re callling prioritizing <term>intensity</term> <vocab>comedy</vocab>, and prioritizing <em>fittedness</em> <vocab>charm</vocab>:</p>


<ol>
   <li><term>Comedy</term> prioritizes a measure of <em>intensity</em>—the more intense the humor, the better the comedy. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more intensity is better comedy.</li>

    <li><term>Charm</term> prioritizes a measure <em>fittedness</em>—the more fitted the humor, the better the charm. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more fittedness is better charm.</li>

<p>Having two measures for humor lets us think about instances of humor in different ways:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe gets a few paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“So you finally got your oil shop up and running, hey?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel intense humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p>Charm (priority is fittedness)
        <narration>Zoe gets a few oil paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel accomplishment)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Thanks Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
</div>

    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: 1rem ">

<p>Zoe felt humor in both examples above—so which humor attempt was “better?” There’s no single answer—it depends on whether we’re prioritizing fittedness or intensity.</p>

<p>If we’re focusing on the <term>intensity</term> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s pun was better. If we’re instead focusing on the <em>fittedness</em> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s affirmation was better.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Since Brad values making his daughter feel humor, it’s helpful for him to recognize that both charm and comedy lead to humor. This gives him more options to reach the same outcome—making Zoe smile or laugh.</p>
</div>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Better.</headline> Sometimes, humor attempts are better at both measures. We saw this with Sam’s prelude to the drama team <callback>(“you guys are lucky to have so much talent…”)</callback>, which had both higher fittedness <sem>and</sem> higher intensity of humor:</p> 
    
                <img src=../images/18c-images-charm/18-01-we-can-prioritize-different-measures/18-01-3-better-better-comedy-charm.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: ">
    
    <p>In this case, one of Sam’s humor attempts was better comedy <sem-weak>and</sem-weak> better charm than another. One option was better no matter which measure we prioritized.</p>

<p>We can use Aesop fables to think about charm. We often feel humor when we read these fables—but when judging this humor as good or bad, we focus on the <term>fittedness</term> of humor, not the <em>intensity</em> of it.</p>

<p>We can see this in some fables. If we feel they <humor-outcome>support an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>give new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, and so on—we should feel some humor:</p>

    <strong>The Wolf and the Lamb</strong>
</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>A wolf came upon a lamb and wanted to eat it, but felt he should give an excuse first.</narration>
    </p> 
    
     <p><speaker>Wolf:</speaker> <speech>"Why, last year you grossly insulted me."</speech></p> 
    <p><speaker>Lamb:</speaker> <speech>"That's impossible, sir, for I wasn't born then."</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Wolf:</speaker> <speech>"Well, you continually feed in my pastures and steel my fodder."</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Lamb:</speaker> <speech>"That can't be, sir, for I haven't yet drunk anything but my mother's milk."</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Wolf:</speaker> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>"Look, I'm not going without my dinner"</speech></p>
    <p><narration>And so the wolf sprang upon the lamb and devoured it without more ado.</narration></p>
</div>

<div class="vignette">
       <p>
        <strong>The Wolf and the Lion</strong>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>A wolf stole a lamb from the flock, and carried it off to devour it at his leisure. But along the way, the wolf met a lion.</narration> <speaker>"I'll take that lamb,"</speaker> <narration>the lion said. The wolf didn't dare to resist, but as the lion was walking away, the wolf spoke his frustration.</narration>
    </p>
    <p><speaker>Wolf:</speaker> <internalaction>(frustrated)</internalaction> <speech>"It's most unjust of you to take what's mine away from me like that."</speech></p>
    <p><speaker>Lion:</speaker> <action>.*laughing*</action> <speech>"It was justly yours, no doubt! The gift of a friend, perhaps, eh?"</speech></p></div>



<p>Many people feel low-intensity humor at Aesop fables&mdash;the humor is often the critical element to them, and what distingishes them from other kinds of instructions.</p>

<p>However, the focus in a fable isn't the <term>intensity</term> of the humor it generates. Instead, we'd think it should be on <em>fittedness</em> of the humor.</p> 

<div class="for-instance-text">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We think the better a fable is, the more we feel it's <humor-outcome>supporting an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>giving new perspectives</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>dealing with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>achieving catharsis</humor-outcome>, and so on—as well as on generating feelings of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, <emotions>realization</emotions>, <emotions>release</emotions>, <emotions>revelation</emotions>, and so on.</p>
    
    </div>

   A great fable may make us laugh. But that's less important than that it's well-fitted. What makes a joke by joke is comedy <callback>(priority is intensity)</callback>—but what makes a fable a fable is charm <callback>(priority is fittedness)</callback>.
