    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can prioritize different measuers of humor</h1>   
    
   

<p>What makes humor “good?” This depends on whether we’re prioritizing intensity or fittedness:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>intensity</strong>, then the more intensely we feel humor, the better the humor.</li>
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>fittedness</strong>, then the more the humor fits the moment, the better the humor.</li> 
    </ul>

<p>In this book, we’re callling prioritizing <term>intensity</term> <em>“comedy,”</em> and prioritizing <term>fittedness</term> <em>“charm:”</em></p>


<ol>
   <li><term>Comedy</term> prioritizes a measure of <em>intensity</em>—the more intense the humor, the better the comedy. If we’re comparing two instances of humor, the one with more intensity is better comedy.</li>

<p>Having two measures for humor lets us think about instances of humor in different ways:</p>

Comedy (priority is intensity)

    <p><narration>Zoe gets a few paintings in a student gallery. Her parents come by to see.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“So you finally got your oil shop up and running, hey?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel intense humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Dad!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- OR -</p>
    
    <p>Charm (priority is fittedness)

    <p><speaker>Brad:</speaker> <speech>“I’m so proud of you, Zo!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Brad’s goal is to make Zoe feel accomplishment)</notes></p>

<p>Zoe felt humor in both examples above—so which humor attempt was “better?” There’s no single answer—it depends on whether we’re prioritizing fittedness or intensity.</p>

<p>If we’re focusing on the <term>intensity</term> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s pun was better. If we’re instead focusing on the <em>fittedness</em> of Zoe’s humor, Brad’s affirmation was better.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Since Brad values making his daughter feel humor, it’s helpful for him to recognize that both charm and comedy lead to humor. This gives him more options to reach the same outcome—making Zoe smile or laugh.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Better.</headline> Sometimes, humor attempts are better at both measures. We saw this with Sam’s prelude to the drama team <callback>(“you guys are lucky to have so much talent…”)</callback>, which had both higher fittedness <sem>and</sem> higher intensity of humor:</p>

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: ">
    
    <p>In this case, one of Sam’s humor attempts was better comedy <sem>and</sem> better charm than another. One option was better no matter which measure we prioritized.</p>
