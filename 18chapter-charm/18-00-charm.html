<p>In previous chapters, we’ve looked at both the <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a> and the <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a> of humor or humor attempts.</p>  

<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at prioritizing <term>fittedness</term> over <em>intensity</em>. We’ll call this <vocab>charm</vocab>:</p>

</div> 


<p>In these examples, people were prioritizing the <sem>fittedness</sem> of their humor attempt—the intensity was neither here nor there.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">When Yasmin’s mother gives Trevor water, she’s wants him to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. Whether he laughs hard or just smiles isn't much of a concern. She cares more about the <term>fittedness</term> of Trevor's humor than the <em>intensity</em>.</p>
    </div>

<p>Sometimes, we think the intensity of humor is the only measure that matters. But having only <term>one</term> measure for humor can make things seem <em>dimensionless</em> and <em>flat</em>.</p>

<p>When we add in a <term>second</term> measure <callback>(fittedness)</callback> we create some helpful <em>depth perception</em> to how we think about humor.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> More intensity isn’t always better&mdash;in fact, we don’t usually care much about intensity. This is obvious with other emotions besides humor—we don’t think anger or sadness is better the more intense it is.</p>
    
     <p>We often think an explosive temper involves “bad” anger, despite the high intensity of it—just like someone who cries and cries at minor inconveniences has “bad” sadness, despite the high intensity of it.</p>
    
    <p>That’s because we usually use <term>fittedness</term>, not <em>intensity</em>, to judge whether anger or sadness is good or not. Anger is seen as good when justified <callback>(fitted)</callback>, just like sadness is seen as good when justified <callback>(fitted)</callback>. The intensity is usually much less important.</p>
    
    <p>It’s the same for humor. At first, we tend to think humor always gets better the more intense the humor is, but that’s not really accurate to our experiences. If we imagine a <term>coworker</term> who laughs long and loudly <sem>all the time</sem>, they'd get on our nerves.</p>
    
    <p>Similarly, if <em>we</em> laughed loudly <sem>all the time</sem>: when getting on the bus; interviewing for employment; talking to coworkers; hanging out with our partner; and so on—we’d be exausted and exhaust other people.</p> 
    
    <p>We'd generally prefer more <term>fitted</term> humor than more <em>intense</em> humor. It's only in relatively niche things&mdash;like comedies&mdash;that we tend to greater weight to the intensity of humor.</p>
