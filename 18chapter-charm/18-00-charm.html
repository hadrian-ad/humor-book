    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">13. Evaluatory information</h1>   
    

<p>In previous chapters, we’ve looked at both the intensity and the fittedness of humor or humor attempts. In this chapter, we’ll look at prioritizing fittedness over intensity.</p> 

<p>We’ll call this “charm”:</p>

 

<p><speaker>Jessica:</speaker> <action>*to a customer*</action> <action>*setting down condiments*</action> <speech>“Oh, I love your style!”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*turns red*</action> <action>*brightens*</action> <action>*beams*</action> <speech>“Oh. Thanks!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Jessica’s humor attempt prioritizes fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;charm)</notes></p>

 

<p><narration>Tucker pokes his head into Amber’s office unannounced.</narration></p> 

<p><speaker>Tucker:</speaker> <speech>“Amber, great work with setting up that meeting today. It was flawless. I don’t know what we’d do without you.”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Amber:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Thank you!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Tucker’s humor attempt prioritizes fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;charm)</notes></p>

 

<p><speaker>Riley:</speaker> <action>*upset*</action> <speech>“Mom? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to break it. Maybe I can make a new one.”</speech></p>  

<p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <speech>“Aw Riley. It’s okay.”</speech> *hugs her* <notes>(&larr;Riley’s humor attempt prioritizes fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;charm)</notes> “Let’s just be more careful next time, okay?”</p>

 

<p><narration>Sam is examining his balding head in the mirror. He rubs it thoughtfully. Jennifer sees him do this, and she grabs him by the arm.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Jennifer:</speaker> <action>*squeezing him*</action> <speech>“You look so handsome.”</speech></p> 

 <p>
     <narration>Sam gives a releasing series of small laughs, and leans against her affectionately.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam’s humor attempt prioritizes fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;charm)</notes>
 </p>

 

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*red-eyed*</action></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“What’s wrong, Em?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“Nothing. I’ve just realized I’m older now than my brother was when h-he died…”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Aw. Emma.”</speech> <action>*hugs*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe’s humor attempt prioritizes fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;charm)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*cries*</action> <action>*laughs*</action></p>

 

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*shopping online*</action> <speech>“Should we order it or not?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <speech>“I just can’t decide! I just love StormConQuest, but the reviews on the expansion are just so mixed. They say StormConQuest: Seas of Drake and Myrrh really simplifies the resource management. What if that ruins it?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*out of the blue*</action> <speech>“What do you think about having a kid?”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*puts hand on face*</action> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Oh god, Trevor. That’s not StormConQuest!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor’s humor attempt prioritizes fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;charm)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Not now obviously. Just spitballing here, random talk.”</speech></p>

 

<p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> <action>*sets down a glass of water*</action> <speech>“Here, I got you some water!”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <speech>“Thank you.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin’s mother’s humor attempt prioritizes fittedness&harr;&#xFE0E;charm)</notes></p> 

<p>In these examples, people were prioritizing the fittedness of their humor attempt—the intensity was neither here nor there.</p>

<div class="for-instance-text">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">When Yasmin’s mother gives Trevor water, she’s wants him to feel acceptance, connection, welcome, and so on—she’s not trying to make Trevor to chuckle for twenty minutes. She cares more about the fittedness of the humor than the intensity.</p>
    </div>

<p>Sometimes, we think the intensity of humor is the only measure that matters. But having only one measure for humor can make things seem dimensionless and flat.</p>

<p>When we add in a second measure (fittedness) we create some helpful depth perception to how we think about humor.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> More intensity isn’t always better. In fact, we don’t usually care much about intensity. Sometimes we think about comedians, where intensity of humor often does matter. But that's exceptional—most of the time in our lives we don't care.</p>
     
    <p>This is obvious with other emotions besides humor—we don’t think anger or sadness is better the more intense it is. We often think an explosive temper involves “bad” anger, despite the high intensity of it—just like someone who cries and cries at minor inconveniences has “bad” sadness, despite the high intensity of it.</p>
    
    <p>That’s because we usually use fittedness, not intensity, to judge whether anger or sadness is good or not. Anger is seen as good when justified (fitted), just like sadness is seen as good when justified (fitted). The intensity is neither here nor there.</p>
    
    <p>It’s the same for humor. At first, we tend to think humor always gets better the more intense the humor is, but that’s not really accurate to our experiences. If we laughed long and loudly all the time—when getting on the bus; interviewing for employment; talking to coworkers; hanging out with our partner; and so on—we’d get on other people’s nerves and exhaust ourselves.</p>
    
    <p>We'd want fitted humor in those circumstances, which is the priority over intensity. It's only in things like comedic videos that we give greater weight to the intensity of humor.</p>
