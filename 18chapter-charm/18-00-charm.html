<p>What makes humor “good?” This is often obvious when watching a funny scene: if we laugh hard, the humor is "good." We're using <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a> to judge humor.</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        Owen and Emma are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title>.
    </p> 
    
    <p><narration>Chief starts hiccuping as he goes up to the witness stand for cross-examination. He can't stop, even as he's cross-examined by the high-powered lawyer.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>The timing is perfect. Emma and Owen are howling with laughter.</narration></p> 
    
    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> *breathless from laughing* <speech>"This scene is <sem-weak>so good</sem-weak>!"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma judges scene by the <outcome-contrast>intensity</outcome-contrast> of her humor)</notes>
    </p>
</div>

<p>But what about all the times when intensity of humor is neither here nor there? How do we judge humor in these cases? We judge by <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a>:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> <action>*sets down a glass of water*</action> <speech>“Here, I got you some water!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <action>*takes glass*</action> <speech>“Thank you.”</speech></p>

<p class="vig-or-indent">-LATER- </p>

<p>
    <Speaker>Trevor:</Speaker> <action>*to Yasmin*</action> <speech>"Your mom is pretty nice."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor judges interaction by the <outcome-contrast>fittedness</outcome-contrast> of his humor)</notes>
</p>
</div> 

<p>We can judge humor by prioritizing intensity <sem>or</sem> by prioritizing fittedness.<p></p> 

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>

   <p class="considertext">If we paused time right before Yasmin's mother handed Trevor some water, and said: "choose one: either Trevor laughs long and loudly, or he feels <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>"&mdash;she'd choose <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>.
        
    <p class="considertext">That's because fittedness is her first consideration in this moment. Intensity is the second consideration. The <sem>priority</sem> was on fittedness.</p>
    </div>

<p>These are two different priorities we can use to judge humor. We'll call prioritizing <term>intensity</term> <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;we'll call prioritizing <em>fittedness</em> <vocab>charm</vocab>.</p>

<p>When judging humor, we choose which measure of humor to prioritize. We'll call prioritizing <term>intensity</term> <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;we'll call prioritizing <em>fittedness</em> <vocab>charm</vocab>.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Priority.</headline> When Yasmin’s mother gives Trevor water, she cares more about the <term>fittedness</term> of Trevor's humor than she does the <em>intensity</em>.</p>
 
   <p>If we paused time right before Yasmin's mother handed Trevor some water, and said: "choose one: either Trevor laughs long and loudly, or he feels <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>"&mdash;she'd choose <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>.
        
    <p>That's because fittedness is her first consideration in this moment. Intensity is the second consideration. When our goals are arranged this way, we're engaged in charm.</p>

    <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> Without really thinking about it, we sometimes assume that more intensity of an emotion is always better. But in fact, more intensity is usually worse. This is obvious with <emotions>anger</emotions> or <emotions>sadness</emotions>&mdash;we think someone with an explosive temper has "bad" anger, despite that anger being intense.</p>
        
    <p>That's because we usually judge <emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>boredom</emotions> <emotions>sadness</emotions>, and so on by <sem>fittedness</sem>, not intensity. We consider anger from others to be "good" when it's justified&mdash;not simply by being intense.</p> 
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. If a coworker had giggling fits anytime we said hi or asked them a question, we'd become exhausted. Similarly, if our classmate laughed uproariously at his own <sem-weak>"that's what she said,"</sem-weak>no matter how it related to the room&mdash;eventually they'd get on our nerves. That's because the general rule of thumb is that we prefer fittedness to intensity for <term>all</term> emotions&mdash;<em>including</em> humor.</p>
          
    <p>It's only in rare cases we see emotional intensity as good for its own sake. If we work out against a heavy bag because we're pissed and have to vent, or are drinking and hanging out with our good friends, we may judge our emotions by intensity more than fittedness. But these are <sem-weak>exceptions</sem-weak> to our standards of emotional judgement, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> the standard itself.
