<p>What makes humor “good?” When we watch a funny scene, we usually think that the harder we laugh, the better the humor. In these cases, we're using <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a> to judge humor.</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        Owen and Emma are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title>.
    </p> 
    
    <p><narration>Chief starts hiccuping as he goes up to the witness stand for cross-examination. He can't stop, even as he's cross-examined by the high-powered lawyer.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>The timing is perfect. Emma and Owen are howling with laughter.</narration></p>

    </p>
</div>

<p>But we don't <sem>always</sem> judge by intensity of humor. Sometimes, the humor is neither here nor there:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> <action>*sets down a glass of water*</action> <speech>“Here, I got you some water!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes> <action>*takes glass*</action> <speech>“Thank you.”</speech></p>

</p>
</div> 

<p>Above, Trevor wasn't going <callback>"hm, I didn't guffaw and chortle, so this humor was bad."</callback> Instead, he thought it was <sem-weak>good</sem-weak> humor&mdash;because Trevor was judging by <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a>. <callback>("Hm, I felt belonging and welcome, so this humor was good.")</callback></p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>

    <p class="considertext">Yasmin's mother would prefer fitted humor over intense humor. If we paused time right before Yasmin's mother handed Trevor some water, and said: <callback>"choose one: either Trevor laughs long and loudly, or he feels <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>"</callback>&mdash;she'd choose <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>e</p>

<p>When judging humor, we can judge mostly by intensity <sem>or</sem>  mostly by fittedness. We'll call judging by <term>intensity</term> <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;and judging by <em>fittedness</em> <vocab>charm</vocab>.</p>

<p>When judging humor, we choose which measure of humor to prioritize. We'll call prioritizing <term>intensity</term> <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;we'll call prioritizing <em>fittedness</em> <vocab>charm</vocab>.</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Priority.</headline> When Yasmin’s mother gives Trevor water, she cares more about the <term>fittedness</term> of Trevor's humor than she does the <em>intensity</em>.</p>
 
   <p>If we paused time right before Yasmin's mother handed Trevor some water, and said: "choose one: either Trevor laughs long and loudly, or he feels <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>"&mdash;she'd choose <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>.
        
    <p>That's because fittedness is her first consideration in this moment. Intensity is the second consideration. When our goals are arranged this way, we're engaged in charm.</p>

    <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> We sometimes assume that <term>more intensity</term> of an emotion is always <term>better</term>. But when we think about it, we'll see that <em>more intensity</em> is usually <em>worse</em>.</p> 
       
    <p>This is obvious with <emotions>anger</emotions> or <emotions>sadness</emotions>&mdash;we think someone with an explosive temper has "bad" anger, despite that anger being intense. That's because we usually judge <emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>boredom</emotions> <emotions>sadness</emotions>, and so on by <sem-weak>fittedness</sem-weak>, not intensity. We consider anger and sadness to be "good" when their justified&mdash;not simply by being intense.</p> 
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. If our coworker had giggling fits for minutes whenever we said hi or asked them a question&mdash;or a classmate laughed so hard at his own jokes that snot came out of his nose <sem-weak>every</sem-weak> time&mdash;we'd become exhausted and avoid them.</p>
         
    <p>That's because the general rule of thumb, with plenty of exceptions, is that we prefer fittedness to intensity for <term>all</term> emotions&mdash;<em>including</em> humor.</p>
