<p>What makes humor “good?” This depends on whether we’re prioritizing <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a> or <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a>:</p>

<!--

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>intensity</strong>, humor is better the more intense it is.</li>
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>fittedness</strong>, humor is better the more it fits the emotional situation.</li> 
    </ul>


What makes humor "good"? This is often obvious when we watch a funny skit. If we laugh hard, the humor attempt is "good" 

Rolling on the floor, laughing? 

It's less obvious in other places though. All across our lives, we give light smiles. 

Trevor.

Is Trevor's humor good or bad? It's not intense, like the skit. On the other hand, it's fitted humor -- he feels lots of humor family words and reaches humor outcomes.
 
We have two measures of humor: intensity and fittedness. And at different times, we prioritize different measures. When we watch a skit, we care most about intensity. When we give someone water, we care most about fittedness. 

In this chapter, we'll ignoring intensity as a measure of "good" humor, and focusing instead of fittedness--what we call charm.


Consider: 
It's not that intensity doesn't matter. It's instead that intensity takes second seat.

<p>When judging humor, we choose which measure of humor to prioritize. We'll call prioritizing <term>intensity</term> <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;we'll call prioritizing <em>fittedness</em> <vocab>charm</vocab>.</p>

<p>We'll be talking about charm throughout this chapter.</p>
 

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Priority.</headline> When Yasmin’s mother gives Trevor water, she cares more about the <term>fittedness</term> of Trevor's humor than she does the <em>intensity</em>.</p>
 
   <p>If we paused time right before Yasmin's mother handed Trevor some water, and said: "choose one: either Trevor laughs long and loudly, or he feels <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>"&mdash;she'd choose <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>.
        
    <p>That's because fittedness is her first consideration in this moment. Intensity is the second consideration. When our goals are arranged this way, we're engaged in charm.</p>
