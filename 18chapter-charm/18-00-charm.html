<p>What makes humor “good?” This depends on whether we’re prioritizing <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a> or <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a>:</p>

<!--

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>intensity</strong>, humor is better the more intense it is.</li>
    <li>If we prioritize <strong>fittedness</strong>, humor is better the more it fits the emotional situation.</li> 
    </ul>

<p>When judging humor, we choose which measure of humor to prioritize. We'll call prioritizing <term>intensity</term> <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;we'll call prioritizing <em>fittedness</em> <vocab>charm</vocab>.</p>


<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">When Yasmin’s mother gives Trevor water, she cares more about the <term>fittedness</term> of Trevor's humor than she does the <em>intensity</em>.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text"> That's because she foremost wants him to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. Whether he laughs hard or just smiles neither here nor there.</p> 
    
    </div>

<p>We're often used to only having <term>one</term> measure for humor <callback>(intensity)</callback>. Having only one measure can make discussions of humor seem dimensionless and flat.</p>

<p>When we add in a <em>second</em> measure <callback>(fittedness)</callback> we create some depth perception to how we think about humor.</p>

<p>We'll be talking about charm throughout this chapter.</p>
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> For emotions, more intensity isn't always better&mdash;in fact, more intensity is usually worse. We don't always think <emotions>anger</emotions> or <emotions>sadness</emotions> always gets "better" as they get more intense. Despite its intensity, we think someone with an explosive temper has "bad" anger.</p>
    
    <p>That's because we usually judge <emotions>anger</emotions>&mdash;or <emotions>boredom</emotions> or <emotions>sadness</emotions>&mdash;by fittedness, not intensity. We consider anger from others to be "good" when it's justified, not simply by being intense.</p> 
    
    <p>It's the same for humor. If our coworker fell over anytime we talked to them, even if we were just saying hi or asking a work question, they'd exhaust us. That's because for all emotions, the general rule is that we prefer fittedness to intensity.</p>
    
    <p>It's only in rare cases we see emotional intensity as good for its own sake. If we work out against a heavy bag  because we're pissed and have to vent, we'll judge our anger by intensity more so than fittedness. If we hang out with friends and get drunk, we'll judge our humor by intensity more so than fittedness. But these are exceptions to standards of judgement, not the standard itself.
