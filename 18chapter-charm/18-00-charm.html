<p>In previous chapters, we’ve looked at both the <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a> and the <a href="../16chapter-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a> of humor or humor attempts.</p>  

<p>In this chapter, we’ll look at prioritizing <term>fittedness</term> over <em>intensity</em>. We’ll call this <vocab>charm</vocab>:</p>

<p>In these examples, people were prioritizing the <term>fittedness</term> of their humor attempt—the <em>
intensity</em> was neither here nor there.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">When Yasmin’s mother gives Trevor water, she foremost wants him to feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on. Whether he laughs hard or just smiles isn't much of a concern. She cares more about the <term>fittedness</term> of Trevor's humor than the <em>intensity</em>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Having only <term>one</term> measure for humor can make things seem dimensionless and flat. But when we add in a <em>second</em> measure <callback>(fittedness)</callback> we create some helpful depth perception to how we think about humor.</p>

<p>We'll be going over this in the rest of the chapter.</p>
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> When we watch comedies, we often think more intensity is better. And so we sometimes think more intense humor is <sem-weak>always</sem-weak> better. But in most of our lives, we don't usually think this. This is obvious with other emotions besides humor—we don’t think <emotions>anger</emotions> or <emotions>sadness</emotions> is better the more intense it is.</p>
    
     <p>We often think an explosive temper involves “bad” anger, despite the high intensity of it. Similarly, we think someone who weeps at minor slights has “bad” sadness, despite the high intensity of it.</p>
    
    <p>That’s because we usually use <term>fittedness</term>, not <em>intensity</em>, to judge whether anger or sadness is good or not. Anger is seen as good when justified <callback>(fitted)</callback>, just like sadness is seen as good when justified <callback>(fitted)</callback>. The intensity is usually much less important.</p>
    
    <p>It’s the same for humor.  If we imagine a coworker who laughs long and loudly <sem>all the time</sem>, they'd get on our nerves. Similarly, if we laughed long and loud at <sem>everything</sem>&mdash;minor jokes, unlocking the car, getting a pat on the back, and so on&mdash;we'd exhaust ourselves and other people. </p> 
    
    <p>That's because we generally prefer more <term>fitted</term> humor than more <em>intense</em> humor. It's only in relatively niche things&mdash;like comedies&mdash;that we tend to greater weight to the intensity of humor.</p>
