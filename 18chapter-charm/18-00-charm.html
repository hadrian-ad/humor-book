<p>In this chapter, we'll look at what we'll call <vocab>charm</vocab>&mdash;which is judging humor by <a href="../16chapter-a-fittedness/16-00-fittedness.html">fittedness</a>.</p> 

<p>We often judge humor by <a href="../3chapter-intensity-of-humor/3-0-intensity-of-humor.html">intensity</a>, not fittedness. When Owen and Emma watch a scene from a comedy, they judge how good it is by how hard they laugh:</p>



<div class="vignette">
    <p>
        Owen and Emma are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman</book-title>.
    </p> 
    
    <p><narration>Chief starts hiccuping as he goes up to the witness stand for cross-examination. He can't stop, even as he's cross-examined by the high-powered lawyer.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>The timing is perfect. Emma and Owen are howling with laughter.</narration></p> 
    
    <p>
        <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*breathless from laughing*</action> <speech>"This scene is <sem-weak>so good!</sem-weak>"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma judges scene by the <outcome-contrast>intensity</outcome-contrast> of her humor)</notes>
    </p>
</div>

<!--
Zoe doesn't laugh. "This movie isn't very good.
-->

<p>But we don't <em>always</em> judge by intensity of humor. Sometimes, the intensity of humor is neither here nor there:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Yasmin’s mother:</speaker> <action>*sets down a glass of water*</action> <speech>“Here, I got you some water!”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*takes glass*</action> <action>*smiles*</action> <notes>(&larr;humor)</notes>  <speech>“Thank you.”</speech></p>

<p class="vig-or-indent">-LATER- </p>

<p>
   <narration>Trevor thinks meeting Yasmin's family went pretty well. Her mom made him feel right at home.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor judges interaction by the <outcome-contrast>fittedness</outcome-contrast> of his humor)</notes>
</p>
</div> 


<p>Above, it was more important to Trevor that he felt <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions> than that he laugh hard. So he thought his smile was good humor&mdash;because he was judging by fittedness, not intensity.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <consider>Consider:</consider>

    <p>Yasmin's mother would prefer fitted humor over intense humor too. Given the choice between making Trevor laugh hard or making Trevor feel <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>&mdash;she'd choose <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions></p>

<p>When judging humor, we choose which measure of humor to prioritize. We'll call prioritizing <term>intensity</term> <vocab>comedy</vocab>&mdash;we'll call prioritizing <term2>fittedness</term2> <vocab>charm</vocab>.</p>

<p>We'll be talking about charm throughout this chapter.</p>
 

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Priority.</headline> When Yasmin’s mother gives Trevor water, she cares more about the <term>fittedness</term> of Trevor's humor than she does the <term2>intensity</term2>.</p>
 
   <p>If we paused time right before Yasmin's mother handed Trevor some water, and said: "choose one: either Trevor laughs long and loudly, or he feels <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>"&mdash;she'd choose <emotions>belonging</emotions> and <emotions>welcome</emotions>.
        
    <p>That's because fittedness is her first consideration in this moment. Intensity is the second consideration. When our goals are arranged this way, we're engaged in charm.</p>

   <aside class="box"> <p><headline>Intensity.</headline> Without thinking about it, we sometimes think that <term>more intensity</term> of an emotion is always <term>better</term>. But when we give it some thought, we'll notice that <term2>more intensity</term2> is usually <term2>worse</term2> without correspondingly more fittedness.</p> 
        
        <p>This is obvious with <emotions>anger</emotions> or <emotions>sadness</emotions>. We consider <emotions>anger</emotions> and <emotions>sadness</emotions> to be "good" when they're <term>justified</term>&mdash;not simply by being <term2>intense</term2>. Someone with an explosive temper has "bad" anger, despite that anger being intense&mdash;since we usually judge <emotions>anger</emotions>, <emotions>boredom</emotions> <emotions>sadness</emotions>, and so on by <sem-weak>fittedness</sem-weak>, not intensity.</p> 
        
        
        
        <p>It's the same for humor. If our coworker had long giggling fits whenever we said hi&mdash;or a classmate always laughed so hard at his own jokes that snot came out of his nose&mdash;we'd become exhausted and avoid them.</p>
             
        <p>That's because the general rule of thumb is that we usually prefer fittedness foremost for <term>all</term> emotions&mdash;<term2>including</term2> humor.</p>  </aside>
