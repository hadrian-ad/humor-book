    <h2 id="exclude-navigation">Charm is felt all across our life</h2>   
    
<p>In the same way we don't notice humor on a walk, we don't always notice the fitted humor we feel all across our life&mdash;like when we:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>get really great hugs</li>
    <li>step into someone’s house to visit them</li>
    <li>are complimented on our outfit</li>
    <li>hear good news</li>
    <li>greet a friend</li>
    <li>step out from the cold</li>
    <li>get a text from a good friend</li>
    <li>are offered a glass of water</li>
    <li>open a perfect gift</li>
    <li>reconcile with someone after a disagreement</li>
    <li>are served delicious-looking food</li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>These are all moments where our mistakes and OKs are evaluated as balancing.</p> 

<p>Even though it's obvious these are all moments where we <humor-tell>laugh</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>smile</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>social seek</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>loosen</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>increase energy</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>have active eyes</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>become optimistic</humor-tell>, <humor-tell>move non-normatively</humor-tell>, and so on&mdash;it's often not until it's pointed out that we actually notice this humor <em>as</em> humor:</p>
 
 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe comes in from the rain, and has to push against the door to close it against the wind. Inside, her apartment is calm and quiet, with the rain against the windows.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Phew!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe has <humor-outcome>survived a stressful situation</humor-outcome>, her <humor-outcome>tensions have eased</humor-outcome>, she <humor-outcome>has a new perspective</humor-outcome>, her <humor-outcome>negative emotions have changed into positive ones</humor-outcome>)</notes></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Zoe won’t necessarily register this as humor&mdash;or even that she laughed. That’s because the humor she feels when she comes home is so well-fitted that she just feels it as one moment unfolding easily into the next:</p>

    alt="This image takes our integration figure of a circle with lines that integrate it to the situation and expands it by having the lines going out left and right of the circle, instead of just left. The lines connect to two boxes labeled 'moment A' and 'moment B.' The image looks a bit like tendons around a joint. An annotation says 'fitted humor helps moments flow together.' ";

<p>Low-intensity humor shows up all across our lives&mdash;and much more frequently than intense humor. It even shows up where it isn't "supposed" to, like when waiting for a bus:</p> 
  

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe is waiting for the bus. It’s drizzly and grey. Then, the bus pulls around the corner, the headlights shining through the rain.</narration> </p>

    alt="This evaluation graph shows intensity of humor. It has two humps, one when the bus pulls into view, and another when the farebox beeps.";
    title="Evaluation graph";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: ;margin-top: 1rem;">


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Zoe lines up with everyone else to file into the bus. Zoe taps her phone at the farebox when it’s her turn. This always makes her a tiny bit anxious.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Then it beeps and gives a green light, the driver waves her in, and she takes her seat.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Zoe feels low-intensity <emotions>relief</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on)</notes></p>
</div> 

<p>Zoe's low-intensity humor can simultaneously be both there and not noticed&mdash;but once pointed out, this humor can be hard <sem-weak>not</sem-weak> to notice.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">When thinking about charm, it's important to be able to notice low-intensity humor by noticing <a href="../9chapter-humor-profile/9-8-to-see-low-intensity-humor-we-learn-to-see-low-intensity-humor-tells.html">low-intensity humor tells</a>.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext"> We saw these before&mdash;in the same way a small smile is a low-intensity variation of <humor-tell>smiling</humor-tell>, a quick shared glance is a low-intensity variation of <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>.</p>  
    
</div>

 
 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Importance.</headline> Sometimes we see stray pennies and nickels as "low-intensity" forms of money&mdash;and so don't really think they're worth noticing or bending down to pick up.</p>
    
    <p>We sometimes implicitly do something similar with humor. We may think a light smile isn't that important, like a penny&mdash;and so maybe not worth paying attention to. If people boarding busses have very faint smiles&mdash;so what?</p> 
    
    <p>These small smiles become important when we can pay attention to fittedness. Fittedness tracks our emotional relation to the world around us&mdash;our changing sense of <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>insight</emotions>, and so on. The presence or absence of those experiences are worth noticing and keeping track of, at any intensity.</p>
    

</div>

<!--
    <p>Money has <term>one</term> value of comparison, magnitude. But other things have <term2>two</term2> values of comparison. For instance, food has taste and size. 
     
<p>We <term>sometimes</term> care most about portion size&mdash;but not <term2>always</term2>. Sometimes we care more about how it tastes. And we can appreciate tiny portions of food if they taste really, really good.</p> 
      
<p>This is like humor. There are two comparable values: intensity and fittedness. How we prioritize these measures changes situation-by-situation, but fitted moments of humor are worth paying attention to&mdash;even if the intensity never crests into broad smiles and laughter.
