<p>In every example above, there was humor. But at the same time, it wasn't particularly intense humor. So should we call this humor good or bad?</p> 

<p>It depends on which measure we're judging by! </p> 



<ul class="close-list">
   <li>If we judge first by <term>intensity</term>, then these would be bad to okay moments of humor.</li>
    
    <li>If we judge first by <em>fittedness</em>, these would all be okay to good moments humor.</li>
    </ul> 

  

  
<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
<p class="considertext">The point here isn't that we have to pick just one measure. The point is instead to notice that there <sem-weak>are</sem-weak> multiple measures to humor&mdash;which allows for multiple kinds of judgement.</p>
       
               <p class="considertext">Discussions of humor can seem dimensionless and flat if we only have <term>one</term> measure for humor <callback>(intensity)</callback>. We can create some depth perception to how we think about humor by adding in a <em>second</em> measure <callback>(fittedness)</callback>.</p>
        
        
        
        
</div>


 
 <div class="box">
     <p><headline>Nameless.</headline> In the examples above, people cared about fittedness first, and intensity second.</p> 
      
     <ul class="close-list">
           <li>Lina <sem>foremost</sem> was hoping the fable would make her feel wiser <callback>(which was why she was reading fables and not an anthology of Sunday comics)</callback></li>
            
            <li>Cyrus was <sem>foremost</sem> hoping his soldiers would feel convinced and satisfied <callback>(which was why he argued with and flattered them, instead of just drinking merrily with them)</callback></li>
            
            <li>Trevor was <sem>foremost</sem> hoping to feel some kind of catharsis or relief by talking with Minh <callback>(which was why he hoped Minh would take him seriously, not joke about being bored)</callback></li>
            
            <li>Zoe <sem>foremost</sem> wanted Trevor to feel included <callback>(which was why she brought him the burrito, instead of teasing him for his bad luck not having a burrito)</callback></li>
             </ul>
             
             <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
     <p>In all of these cases, success is marked <sem-weak>by humor</sem-weak>. The absence of humor tells would show failure. At the same time, it's the fittedness of the humor that matters most, not intensity. </p>
