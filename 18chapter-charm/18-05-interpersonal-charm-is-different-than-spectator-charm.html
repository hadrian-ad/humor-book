    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Interpersonal charm is different than spectator charm</h1>   
    


<p>Sometimes, the word <term>“charm”</term> makes us think about <em>spectator charm</em>—which makes us think of a certain kind of affectation, background, confidence, glamour, grooming, wit, and so on. We often associate spectator charm with flirtatiousness and seduction.</p>

<p>But here we’re talking about real-life charm, <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> spectator charm—and compared to what we see in movies, real-life charm is much more accessible, benign, familiar, and so on.</p>

<p>For instance, under our definition of charm, we can imagine meeting two cats: a “charming” cat and an “uncharming” cat.</p>

   <ul class="close-list">
    <li>The <term>charming</term> cat would quickly <humor-outcome>become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>ease tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>change our negative emotions into positive ones</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li> 
    
<li>The <em>uncharming</em> cat would <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>resist</outcome-contrast> becoming accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>raise</outcome-contrast> tension</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>change positive emotions into <outcome-contrast>negative</outcome-contrast> ones</humor-outcome>, and so on.</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>The cats would be charming or not depending on the ease and frequency that they reach humor outcomes. This doesn’t have anything to do with the cats being flirtatious and seductive!</p>

<p>We can make this comparison between anything. We can imagine:</p>

   <ul class="close-list">
    <li>two parents, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
    <li>two middle school basketball coaches, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
    <li>two guest speakers, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
    <li>two houses, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
    <li>two walks, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This doesn’t mean one pair is flirtatious and seductive the other isn’t! It just means one of the two can more easily reach humor outcomes and make people feel humor family words than the other. Their ability to frequently generate fitted humor makes them charming.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Spectator charm.</headline> In our chapter on <a href="../10chapter-spectator-entertainment/10-0-spectator-entertainment.html">spectator entertainment</a>, we saw how watching <term>characters</term> insult each other or be run over by busses can generate humor for <em>us</em>.</p> 
    
    <p>But that doesn't mean we can straightforwardly use that as a template for generating humor in interpersonal interactions&mdash;we can't hit people with busses or insult someone and expect nothing but humor.</p>
    
    <p>The same thing is true of spectator charm. We often see characters referred to as "charming" with ambiguous or impossible personal backgrounds; dark, antiheroic aesthetics; utter confidence; wealth; or so on.</p>
    
    <div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
        <p class="for-instance-text">Readers or watchers of <book-title>Gone with the Wind</book-title> may see Rhett as <humor-outcome>controlling the situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticizing</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>sharing personal views</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>creating rapport (with the readers or other characters)</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handling (Scarlett or other people's) complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>able support his arguments</humor-outcome>, and so on.</p> 
        
        <p class="for-instance-text">This makes readers see him as a "charming" character.</p> </div> 
    
    <p>But similar to hitting someone with a bus, it would be odd to think that spectator charm <callback>("utter confidence")</callback> would be something we'd want to straightforwardly aspire to in our day-to-day lives to generate humor.</p>
    
<div class="for-instance">
        <p class="for-instance">For instance</p>
        <p class="for-instance-text">When Rhett talks to Scarlett, the <term>audience</term> feels he's charming&mdash;but the <em>character</em> (Scarlett) feels he's repulsive and infuriating. So we wouldn't want to be exactly like Rhett in real life and be seen as repulsive.</p> 
        
    <p class="considertext">Rhett may be a great example of how <term>characters</term> can be seen as charming&mdash;not a great example of how <em>we</em> can be seen as charming.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>For the same reason generating intense humor in interpersonal situations is a bit different than how movies generate intense humur in audiences, how we generate fitted humor is a bit different than how movies generate fitted humor.</p>
    
    <p>This is a freeing observation. In the same way it would be weird to think we were supposed to be like characters who:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>spontaneously dance 
            have swordfights </li>
        <li>defeated illness with only the strength of vengeance</li>
        <li>held long witty conversations</li> </ul>
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
    <p>it would <sem-weak>also</sem-weak> be weird to think we were supposed to imitate characters who were scripted to be charming for a spectator template.</p>
     
     <p>Instead, we can look around and see who we actually find charming&mdash;which may be teachers, coaches, cashiers, friends, uncles, and so on who aren't movie characters but help us reach humor outcomes easily anyway.</p>

    
<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
            <p class="considertext">
    Movies often have large OKs. That means they need large mistakes to generate humor. This is why movies go to anti-heroes or rogueish characters. These characters generating large mistakes for these large OKs&mdash;and audiences will see them as charming.</p>
                
    <p class="considertext">These surreal attributes work well in spectator templates, but don't straightforwardly transplant to interpersonal templates.</p> 
            
            
    <p class="considertext">This is similar to how heavy stage makeup works well under bright lights from a distance. But just because it looks good to audiences for a staged production doesn't mean it would look good if we wore it to work.</p>
