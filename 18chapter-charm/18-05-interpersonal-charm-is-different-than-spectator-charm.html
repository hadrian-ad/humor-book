<p>Sometimes, the word “charm” makes us think about spectator charm—which makes us think of a certain kind of affectation, background, confidence, glamour, grooming, wit, and so on. We often associate spectator charm with flirtatiousness and seduction.</p>

<p>But we’re talking about real-life charm, not spectator charm—and compared to what we see in movies, this charm is much more accessible, benign, normal, and so on.</p>

<p>For instance, under our definition of charm, we can imagine meeting two cats: a “charming” cat and an “uncharming” cat.</p>

   <ul class="close-list">
    <li>The charming cat would quickly become accepted, ease tension, change our negative emotions into positive ones, and so on.</li> 
    
<li>The uncharming cat would resist becoming accepted, raise tension, change positive emotions into negative ones, and so on.</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <p>The cats would be charming or not depending on the ease and frequency that they reach humor outcomes. This doesn’t have anything to do with the cats being flirtatious and seductive!</p>

<p>We can make this comparison between anything. We can imagine:</p>

   <ul class="close-list">
    <li>two parents, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
    <li>two middle school basketball coaches, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
    <li>two guest speakers, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
    <li>two houses, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
    <li>two walks, one “charming” and the other “uncharming”</li>
        </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This doesn’t mean one pair is flirtatious and seductive the other isn’t! It just means one of the two can easily reach humor outcomes and make people feel humor family words. Their ability to frequently generate fitted humor makes them charming.</p>

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Spectator charm.</headline> Spectator charm often involves people with ambiguous or impossible personal backgrounds; dark, antiheroic aesthetics; utter confidence; wealth; or so on. These surreal attributes work well in movies, since spectator entertainment has large OKs that need large mistakes to generate humor.</p>
    
    <p>This is similar to how heavy stage makeup works well under bright lights from a distance. But just because it looks good for a staged production doesn't mean it would look good in other situations. For the same reason, it would be odd to think that spectator charm would be something we'd want to straightforwardly aspire to in our day-to-day lives.</p>
