    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can prioritize fittedness while still not being abdove dress code</h1>   
    
   

<p>Even if someone is prioritizing fittedness, that doesn’t mean their humor attempt will be above the humor dress code:</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Elias is ordering coffee.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to barista*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“If I could see the clearest skies or your eyes—damn! I’d choose your eyes every time.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Barista:</speaker> <action>*pursing lips*</action> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Here’s your coffee.”</speech></p>
</div>

 

<div class="vignette">
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to stranger*</action> <speech>“Wow, you’re beautiful. Message me, okay?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Stranger:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“You know I won’t.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“I know. But message me.”</speech></p>
</div>


<p>Elias isn’t focused on intensity—it’s not comedy. Instead, his goal is to reach humor outcomes—it’s charm. Elias wants to <humor-outcome>help himself become accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>open a new topic of conversation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduce her defensiveness</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reveal a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>deal with taboo topics</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>control a situation</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticize himself</humor-outcome>, and so on.
    </p>
    
<p>But even though Elias was prioritizing fittedness, his humor attempt was still below the situation’s humor dress code—since the topics were irrelevant and there’s a high dress code with strangers:</p>

    style="max-width: 20rem ; margin-left: ">


<p>Being unfitted doesn’t mean someone <term>will</term> censure Elias. It just means that <em>if</em> someone does, people will see the justification for the censure as greater than the justification for the charm.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Someone can feel humor and also justifiably censure us—since intensity and fittedness are two different things. A laugh doesn’t mean the humor is fitted—it just means the humor was relatively intense. We can’t use the intensity of humor tells to straightforwardly think <callback>“it must have been fitted.”</callback></p>

    <p>We've seen high-velocity humor attempts before, like in the clip from a comedy show:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe is watching a comedy show.</narration> </p>
    
    <p><narration>Fleabag is stressed from a family reunion. She steps outside the restaurant to smoke. Hot Priest, one of the dinner guests, steps outside as well.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> *smiles* "Fellow smoker. Have a spare one?"</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> "Sure." *smiles* *hands him cigarette and lights it*</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> *takes a drag* (conversationally) "So does your family get together much, or—?"</p>
    
    <p><narration>To destroy the possibility of small talk, Fleabag brusquely heads back inside.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> "Fuck you, then."</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> (shocked) *turns to stare at him*</p> 
    
    <p><speaker>Hot Priest:</speaker> *smiles*</p>
    
    <p><speaker>Fleabag:</speaker> *smiles broadly* <notes>(&larr;humor that seems to defy social physics)</notes> <action>*heads inside*</action></p>
    
    
    <p><narration>Zoe smiles as she watches. They have good chemistry, and she can't wait to see what horrible things befall them this season.</narration></p>

<p>We can describe the comment as it relates to the emotional situation. We start by identifying it as a humor attempt—since he wanted her to smile, and not feel mistake-predominant emotions. Once we identify it as a humor attempt, we decide whether it was a charm attempt or a comedy attempt. Was he prioritizing fittedness, or intensity?</p>
 
<p>His goal wasn't intensity—how hard she laughed was less important to him than that she thought he <humor-outcome>supported an argument</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>created rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>became accepted</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>reduced defensiveness, revealed a personality trait</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>handled complaints</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolized ties</humor-outcome>, and so on. Because of this, we can call this humor attempt a charm attempt.</p>
 
<p>This is true even though he had to use a high-velocity comment to reach these humor outcomes. The woman was guarding against humor outcomes, and it took something with high velocity to reach them. These high-velocity comments don't always strike us as humor attempts, since we're used to describing them as something else—as insults, rudeness, teasing, or so on. But we can clarify things by calling it a high-velocity charm attempt.</p>

<p>A "high-velocity charm attempt" is the comments relation to the emotional situation. This is an improvement over descriptions like "joke" or "insult" which are words that often don't relate comments very well to the emotional situation.</p>

<p>We said before that high-velocity can get past defenses to reach humor tripwires—but that the same thing that makes high-velocity comments effective makes the consequences not reaching humor tripwires worse. For instance, saying <callback>"sorry, just trying to make conversation"</callback> probably wouldn't make the woman smile—but it probably wouldn't create irreparable social damage either. By contrast, <callback>"fuck you"</callback> may make the woman smile—but it could also cause social damage if it doesn't.</p>
 
<p>Why does the priest risk this? The priest risks this because he always knows what the emotional outcome will be: he has the competence to emotionally forecast that she'll eventually feel he <humor-outcome>handled her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome>acceptably criticized</humor-outcome> her—and not that he was <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>disgruntled</outcome-contrast> by her criticism</humor-outcome> and <humor-outcome><outcome-contrast>unacceptably</outcome-contrast> criticized her</humor-outcome>. The priest had gained this competence through experience and practice. (We talked about this before in our social physics interval.)</p>
 
<p>Since this is an example from spectator entertainment (a romantic comedy), we can't take it too straightforwardly as a template for our real life interactions. But at the same time, the clip does capture something that we can see all across our lives once we know what to look for—moments in our day-to-day life that aren't always easy to record or convey, but are often important to being socially comfortable and effective.</p>

<p>For instance, we can look at a story someone posted in a forum in response to calls for strong sensual memories. He wrote:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>I (male) was taking a scuba diving class in my university. There was a stunning redhead with a amazing body. We never spoke in class. Fast forward to the end of the school year. We are diving for 2 days at a lake doing the checkout dives. One day 1 as I am exiting the water she is entering the water and said something to like “hurry up you are holding me up” I have no idea why but my response was “Fuck you” in a playful tone. She smiles and responds “OK”. My mind is blown. Class ends and she said. I’ll see you tomorrow. The next day she did not make it to class because she was involved in a car accident. She had injuries that kept her from diving. So yeah. Never saw her again. It’s been 23 years and I still remember that sexy redhead in the white two piece.</narration>
        </p>
</div>

<p>We see something similar in this story as in the show. In this book, "playful" is another word for a humor attempt—the man was attempting to intentionally shift mistakes and OK into balance. <narration>(Playful tone = humor attempt.)</narration> In this case, the man doesn't sound like he had practice with this kind of comment, but felt a momentary, intuitive understanding of the outcome. </p>
 
<p>We can think about humor outcomes and humor family words to make sense of how the man saw the situation. He felt her smile showed mutual <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>closeness</emotions>, <emotions>delight</emotions>, and so on—and that their mutual humor <humor-outcome>created rapport</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>revealed a personal view</humor-outcome>, <humor-outcome>symbolized ties</humor-outcome>, and so on. (This is how he interpreted the experience, which may or may not be accurate.)</p>
