<p>Even if someone is prioritizing fittedness, that doesn’t mean their humor attempt will be above the humor dress code:</p>


<p><narration>Elias is ordering coffee.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to barista*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“If I could see the clearest skies or your eyes—damn! I’d choose your eyes every time.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Barista:</speaker> <action>*pursing lips*</action> <internalaction>(annoyed)</internalaction> <speech>“Here’s your coffee.”</speech></p>

 

<p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*to stranger*</action> <speech>“Wow, you’re beautiful. Message me, okay?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;charm attempt that’s below dress code)</notes></p>

<p><speaker>Stranger:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“You know I won’t.”</speech></p>

<p><speaker>Elias:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“I know. But message me.”</speech></p>


<p>Elias isn’t focused on intensity—it’s not comedy. Instead, his goal is to reach humor outcomes—it’s charm. Elias wants to help himself become accepted, open a new topic of conversation, reduce her defensiveness, reveal a personal view, deal with taboo topics, control a situation, acceptably criticize himself, and so on.
    </p>
    
<p>But even though Elias was prioritizing fittedness, his humor attempt was still below the situation’s humor dress code—since the topics were irrelevant and there’s a high dress code with strangers:</p>

 

<p>Being unfitted doesn’t mean someone will censure Elias. It just means that if someone does, people will see the justification for the censure as greater than the justification for the charm.</p>

    <p class="considertext">Someone can feel humor and also justifiably censure us—since intensity and fittedness are two different things. A laugh doesn’t mean the humor is fitted—it just means the humor was relatively intense. We can’t use the intensity of humor tells to straightforwardly think“it must have been fitted.”</p>
