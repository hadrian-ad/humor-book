<p>Charm is usually a two-way street. It’s not enough to make <term>others</term> feel fitted humor—we have to allow <em>ourselves</em> to feel fitted humor as well.</p>

<p>Zoe’s goal isn’t to be emotionally guarded while making Sara feel humor. Instead, Zoe has to <sem>also</sem> express humor when Sara is charming in return, or when Zoe feels <emotions>realization</emotions> or <emotions>insight</emotions>.</p>

 

<p><narration>Sara sets her backpack down and admires Zoe’s plants.</narration></p>

<p><speaker>Sara:</speaker> <narration>“You’ve always done such a good job with your plants. I can barely keep that succulent you gave me alive, let alone look after twenty pots!”</narration></p>

<p>Over time, <sem>mutual</sem> fitted humor allows for <sem>mutual</sem> feelings of <emotions>appreciation</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>reconciliation</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on—which accomplishes Zoe’s goal of mutually renewing their friendship.</p>

<p>This is why Zoe gives greater priority to fittedness than intensity for most of the conversation—consistent fittedness is more in-line with her long-term objectives than intensity by itself.</p>

 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Default.</headline> Charm is our default stance—we default to prioritizing fittedness. That's because fitted humor allows us have functioning and enjoyable experiences with each other. We continually help each other feel humor family words and reach humor outcomes by default, which allows a genuine conversation to happen—one where we mutually feel <emotions>acceptance</emotions>, <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>generosity</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.</p>
     
    <p>Sometimes we don't default to charm because we're not good at it. Helping someone feel <emotions>connection</emotions> may be frightening or challenging. Other people default to comedy instead, like class clowns who take every opportunity to produce laughs, no matter what.</p>
     
    <p>When we can default easily to charm, it doesn't just improve our day-to-day interactions with others—it also improves our skill at comedy too. That's because having a successful base lets us pick and choose the best moments to prioritize intensity, instead of feeling compelled to try for intensity all the time and hoping that something lands. This makes us more successful at avoiding bad comedy outcomes, while promoting good ones.</p>
