      This is in contrast to efforts to base an understanding of the world through clinical psychology or computational or evolutionary biology. Those approaches are useful in some contexts, won't be referenced in this book.</p> 
      
                  
      <p>We're used to this approach just about everywhere&mdash;except, sometimes, when it comes to ourselves.</p>
      
    <p>If we've noticed that some buildings feel better to be in than others, we won't pick up a book about physics to start trying to figure out why this is.</p>
      
    <p>Similarly, if we watch a great video essay on beautiful movies, we'd feel insight and change our relation to those movies&mdash;and we wouldn't worry about whether the essayist confirms their statements through evolutionary theory. 
            </p> 
        
    <p>It's the same for humor. Our first goal is to organize some of our observations and experiences in a way that creates insight, and changes our relation to things and people.</p>

<p>
 These evaluations may or may not be statistically sound&mdash;they're subjective.</p>

          Statistically, any dice roll is as likely as any other. But that doesn't mean Yasmin feels every dice roll is equally expected. Similarly, Zoe may expect to get 100% on her essay&mdash;even though if you ask her, she'd say she usually gets 95%.</p>
           
    
           <p>That's because our expectations and evaluations are subjective, and can go against our past experiences or attempts thoughtfully estimate likelihoods.</p>

		We sometimes try really hard to prevent humor—like to win a no-smiling contest, to run a somber tabletop roleplaying scene, to respectfully listen, and so on. The easiest way to prevent breaking out into a smile is to worry less about <em>eliminating</em> humor. This gives our evaluations a sizing that doesn't find small mistakes funny.</p>

    <p>It takes some practice and understanding of method to balance mistakes and OKs like this. But we <term>can</term> practice, <term2>because</term2> it's a skill—it's something we can improve at!</p>

        <p>And while we won’t use these words in this book, we could also use words too, like
        <emotions>discovery</emotions>,
        <emotions>reinterpretation</emotions>, <emotions>self-discovery</emotions>, <emotions>transformation</emotions>,
        and so on—all of which describe moments of humor.</p>

   <p>Often, humor tells are shaped by circumstances—like how <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell> looks different depending on where people are. If they're close, we may share a glance; if they're in another room, we may run into it to find them; if they're in another state we may pull out our phone to text them. These are all variations of <humor-tell>social seeking</humor-tell>.</p>
