    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Emotion networks are why we can communicate without words</h1>
    

<p>Emotion networks can help us look past words and speakings to get at a deeper fabric of how people interact with each other. </p>
  
<div class="for-instance"><p class="for-instance">For instance</p>
      
      <p class="for-instance-text">If people synchronize mistakes and OKs over an emotional network&mdash;then we generate humor in others by getting them to synchronize their mistake or OK with us in a way that brings that topic's evaluations into balance.</p>
      
      <p class="for-instance-text">This helps us think with greater depth and breadth about how humor is often intentionally or unintentionally brought about&mdash;with or without words.</p> 
      
      </div>  

 <p>To help us think beyond words, it's worth thinking about all the things our emotion network allows us to do&mdash;all wordlessly, like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
    <li>assemble things together <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>assign tasks with a specified degree of urgency <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>claim a section of a beach <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>express affection <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>fan out to search for something <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>flirt with someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>indicate something with a specified degree of permissiveness <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>organize ourselves on a bus <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show that we’re unbothered <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show support <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>walk around busy streets <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>welcome someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Humor plays a role in all of those things above&mdash;we smile to share evaluations, which allows others to reach evaluatory consensus with us.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This helps us see how humor is more than something that happens in reaction to jokes. Instead, jokes are using on a broader <sem-weak>system</sem-weak> of grouping around evaluations. Focusing on this <sem-weak>system</sem-weak> helps us see a fuller scope to something like humor.</p>
</div>

<p>This all applies to any emotion, not just humor. All this is often easiest to see in dramatic circumstances, like when:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>awareness of a shocking event trickles from one end of the bar to everyone else <callback>(without spoken explanation)</callback></li>
    <li>belligerent attitudes harden people into groups <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>fear travels throughout a city <callback>(without spoken reasoning)</callback></li>
    <li>festive attitudes draw people together <callback>(without spoken invitation)</callback></li>
    <li>good news ripples through a classroom <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>a restaurant suddenly falls silent <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>uncertainty sweeps through a train <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>worried crowds soften into release and celebration <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>What's worth noticing above is that we usually think <term>evaluations</term> are <sem>more</sem> important than the <em>context</em>.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">If we're about to go into a bar, we don't care so much <term>what</term> people are talking about. We instead care about <em>how</em> they're talking about things—whether they're afraid, belligerent, laughing, relaxed, and so on.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">Similarly, if a bar we're in suddenly goes silent, we'll go silent too—since our first concern isn't <term>what</term> happened, it's how people <em>feel</em> about what happened.</p>    
    </div>
    
    <p>This all is important to humor. Humor often happens as smiles exchanged while walking or after a greeting, or laughter after hugging or recieving good news, from someone rolling their eyes, and other interactions.</p>
    
     <p>These can be wordless or not&mdash;but despite how important these instances of humor are to our sense of being around others, we don't always find it easy to talk about how or why this happens. This is especially true humor happens wordlessly.</p> 

<p>We'll use "emotion networks" throughout this book as a way of talking about how evaluations are shared between people. Essentially, emotion networks are the social or evaluatory medium that everything happens in.</p>


<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">This isn't specific to <term>humor</term>—it's the same for <term>any</term> emotion. Like humor, mistake-predominate emotions can happen simply by exchanging looks or listening to angry people. Words are <em>sometimes</em> involved, but not <em>always</em>.</p>
</div>




 
 <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Medium.</headline> Emotion networks are important! We can't ignore them—trying to learn about humor without mentioning emotion networks would be like trying to learn about fish without mentioning water.</p>
     
<p>When we think about the people in our lives who have been good at making others laugh, we'll notice that they often have a field-like quality of influence on people around them&mdash;part of their good understanding of the overall emotional situation.</p> 
    
    <p>In other words, they're skilled at being able to see, interpret, and act within these emotion networks! This skill is inseparable from their broader skill at making others laugh. It's a skill we can improve ourselves through attention and practice.</p>

    <p>That's the end of this chapter!</p>

<div class="content-example">
    
<p>As we increase our attention to each other’s emotional state, we increase the informational tension between them—forming a connection between them.</p> 
     
<p>This <vocab>human surface tension</vocab> is what makes groups groups:</p>

     >

 

<p>We can see the degrees of human surface tension any time we look at any group of people:</p>


<div class="vignette">

<p>We increase or decrease this informational tension by how much mutual attention we give each other:</p>

<p>"Grouping" is so normal that it's sometimes hard to even think about. Human surface tension is one way of drawing attention to the connection that groups us, how that connection happens, what it is, and how it changes over time.</p>

<p>It can also more elegantly describe emotion networks and subnetworks:
    </p>

<img src=../images/closer-look/cl-information-tension/cl-7-surface-tension-is-networks.png

    alt="This figure takes our previous image for emotion networks and subnetworks, and replaces them with surface tension diagrams.";
    title="Dots more accurately describe emotion network";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>These groupings are fluid and can quickly change over time—since we’re constantly changing which people we put effort into sharing and receiving information with.</p> 

<p>We can see arrangements, degrees, and changes of human surface tension whenever we look at anyone. We can see this in some pictures:</p>


<img src=../images/closer-look/cl-information-tension/cl-8-surface-tension-examples.png

    alt="This figure has close-ups of people at tables at a ballroom, and transposes them into surface tension diagrams. People who are disinterested in each other have small dots, people who are deeply interested have large dots, and groups of non-mutual interest have both large and small dots.";
    title="Applying surface tension diagrams";
    style="max-width: 28rem ; margin-left: 1rem; "

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 28rem ; margin-left: 1rem;" 
     >



<p>In each of these pictures, the human surface tension is fluid and tangible—it's the constantly changing degree of informational exchange between people. </p>

<p>Our ability to handle human surface tension is what enables us to form or disband groups. And while this skill is broader than just "humor," it's also essential to any skill around humor.</p>

<p>We can improve our awareness and control of human surface tension&mdash;which in turn enables connective and precise humor with others. That's because it gives us the nuanced information needed to shift mistakes and OKs on various topics to generate mutual humor.</p>
