    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We form cohesive emotion networks by synchronizing</h1>
    
We always network emotionally with everyone around us—it’s why we always feel the mood of a room whenever we walk into one.

> Consider:

For instance, we can walk into a room and immediately tell if the people there are belligerent, bored, cowering, delighted, focused, posturing, relaxed, scared, studious, worried, and so on—and in what combination. We can do this even if we don't know the context, and even if the people aren't aware of us! 

When we walk into a coffee shop, we’ll be part of the overall emotion network:

 

To join the overall network, we synchronize on just a few high-level topics, like ‘public manners,’ ‘physical safety,’ ‘noise decorum,’ and so on. 

Within the overall network are subnetworks, which synchronize on many more topics:



For instance, Zoe and Emma will be closely synchronizing and resynchronizing on many topics all the time. They’ll notice small differences in evaluations:

 

Emma: “Thank god Justin gave us all extensions.’

Zoe: “Yeah.” *tilts head back slightly* (<- Zoe doesn’t feel their evaluatory information is synchronized)

Emma: (curious) “Yeah? But what? (<- Emma picks up their desynchronization, and wants to resynchronize)

 

Zoe and Emma are on their laptops, when Zoe gives a small laugh.

Emma: *looks up* *smiling* “What?” (<- Emma picks up their desynchronization, and wants to synchronize)

While head tilts or small laughs will desynchronize Emma and Zoe’s subnetwork, they won’t desynchronize the overall emotion network of the cafe—since Zoe’s head tilt didn’t involve any of the network-wide topics.

By contrast, if someone starts yelling, the overall network may feel desynchronized: 



Someone start yelling and the entire cafe goes quiet. (<- yelling desynchronizes the overall network) Zoe and Emma start looking around. Zoe makes eye contact with someone sitting near the window, and Emma examines a couple who’s looking at the person yelling. The barista scans everyone in the room. (<- cafe tries to synchronize evaluations and reach a consensus assessment) 

When the cafe becomes desynchronized, everyone there will try to resynchronize their evaluations. This establishes an emotional consensus, which helps them decide on what to do—like whether to intervene with the yeller or not. 

If the cafe can’t resynchronize, there's no emotional consensus. The emotion network fragments, and people will feel uncomfortable or unsafe and leave:



 

Efficiency. Our emotion network lets us be aware of the evaluations of others, which gives us efficiency of scale. Since many hands make light work, this shrinks our evaluatory responsibilities.

For instance, when a dish breaks in a cafe, all twenty people inside don't need to make the same twenty investigations to decide whether or not everything's okay. Instead, they can quickly come to an evaluatory conclusion using the evaluations of others. 

If a dish breaks and the staff are calm, we'll be calm—even if we don't actually know what happened. By pooling our evaluations, we limit the number of redundant evaluations that have to happen. We experience this all the time. If we:
know someone is watching the baby or a fire, we don’t need to check on those things as often
search a field or a house as a group, we can spread out and not have to all retread the same ground
walk a busy street, we can focus on what's nearby and ignore things further away from us  
(and so on)

In all these cases, our emotion network allows us to have greater evaluatory awareness than we would on our own.
