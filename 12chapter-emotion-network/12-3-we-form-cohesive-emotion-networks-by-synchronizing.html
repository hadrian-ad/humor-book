    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We form cohesive emotion networks by synchronizing</h1>
    
<p>We always network emotionally with everyone around us—it’s why we always feel the mood of a room whenever we walk into one.</p>
<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">We can walk into a room and immediately tell if the people there are belligerent, bored, cowering, delighted, focused, posturing, relaxed, scared, studious, worried, and so on—and in what combination. We can do this even if we don't know the context of those feelings, and even if they're not aware of us! 
        </p>
    </div>
    
    
    <button type="button" class="collapsible-example" style="margin-top: 1rem">Picture example:</button>
  
  <div class="content-example">

  <p>In the picture below, we have an immediate impression of everyone's emotional state. We know they're not about to break into a fight, or into tears; they're not exceptionally bored, or worried, or focused; or so on.
                    </p>

<p>We can know these things becaues everyone is always radiating emotion tells, and forming an emotion network. In a picture, we pick up on a slice of the emotion network—which we can do even without knowing anything about the context.</p>
     
    </div>

    
    <p>When we walk into a coffee shop, we’ll be part of the overall emotion network:</p>

     <img src=../images/12c-emotion-network/12-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks/12-3-1-overall-network.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: 20rem; margin-left: " 
     >


<p>To join the overall network, we synchronize on just a few high-level topics, like ‘public manners,’ ‘physical safety,’ ‘noise decorum,’ and so on.</p> 

<p>Within the overall network are subnetworks. These are smaller groups of people, who synchronize on many more topics:</p>

     <img src=../images/12c-emotion-network/12-3-we-form-cohesive-emotion-networks/12-3-2-emotion-network-subnetworks.png

    title="";
    style="max-width: 28rem; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>For instance, Zoe and Emma will be closely synchronizing and resynchronizing on many topics all the time. They’ll notice small differences in evaluations:</p>

 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>"Thank god Justin gave us all extensions."</speech></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <speech>“Yeah.”</speech> <action>*tilts head back slightly*</action> <notes>(&larr;Zoe doesn’t feel their evaluations are synchronized)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(curious)</internalaction> <speech>“Yeah? But what?"</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma picks up their desynchronization, and wants to resynchronize)</notes></p>
    </div>
 

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Zoe and Emma are on their laptops, when Zoe gives a small laugh.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*looks up*</action> <action>*smiling*</action> <speech>“What?”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Emma picks up their desynchronization, and wants to synchronize)</notes></p>
    </div>

<p>While head tilts or small laughs will desynchronize <term>Emma and Zoe’s</term> subnetwork, they won’t desynchronize the <em>overall</em> emotion network of the cafe—since Zoe’s head tilt didn’t involve any of the network-wide topics.</p>

<p>By contrast, if someone starts yelling, the overall network may feel desynchronized: 
    </p>


<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Someone start yelling and the entire cafe goes quiet.</narration> <notes>(&larr;yelling desynchronizes the overall network)</notes></p>
   
   <p><narration>Zoe and Emma start looking around. Zoe makes eye contact with someone sitting near the window, and Emma examines a couple who’s looking at the person yelling. The barista scans everyone in the room.</narration> <notes>(&larr;cafe tries to synchronize evaluations and reach a consensus assessment)</notes></p> 
    </div>

<p>When the cafe becomes desynchronized, everyone there will try to resynchronize their evaluations. This establishes an emotional consensus—which helps them decide on what to do, like whether to intervene with the yeller or not. 
    </p>
    
<p>If the cafe can’t resynchronize, there's no emotional consensus. The emotion network fragments, and people will feel uncomfortable or unsafe and leave:</p>

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Efficiency.</headline> Our emotion network lets us be aware of the evaluations of others. This gives our evaluations an efficiency of scale. In the same way many hands make light work for everyone, many <term>evaluators</term> shrink our individual evaluatory responsibilities.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, when a dish breaks in the kitchen of a cafe, all twenty customers don't need to personally walk to the kitchen to decide whether or not everything's okay. Instead, all twenty can quickly come to an evaluatory conclusion using the evaluations of just one or two other people.</p> 
    
    <p>If a dish breaks and the staff are calm, we'll be calm—even without actually know what specifically happened. By pooling our evaluations, the cafe limited the number of redundant evaluations that had to happen.</p>
    
     <p> We experience this all the time, like if we:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>know someone is watching the baby or a fire, we don’t need to check on those things as often</li>
        <li>search a field or a house as a group, we can spread out and not have to all retread the same ground</li>
        <li>walk a busy street, we can focus on what's nearby and ignore things further away from us</li>
        </ul>  
    
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>
    
<p>In all these cases, our emotion network allows us to have greater evaluatory awareness than we would on our own.</p>
