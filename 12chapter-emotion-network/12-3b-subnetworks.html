  <p>When we walk into a room, we have an immediate impression of everyone's emotional state&mdash;in the picture below, we know they're not about to break into a fight; start crying; take a nap; mill about with worry worried, or focused; or so on.
                    </p>

<p>We know these things because everyone is always radiating emotion tells, forming an emotion network. We can access all this information to make sense of everyone's evaluatory state.</p>
     
       <p>But within an overall network are subnetworks, which we are often most obvious in larger groups of people. At the dance hall below, we can see how people aren't splitting their attention evenly among all fifty people&mdash;instead, people give different amounts of attention to different people, leading to subneworks:</p>

<p>Similarly, at a cafe everyone is vaguely aware of everyone else <callback>(overall nework)</callback>&mdash;but different groups are more intensely aware of subsections <callback>(subnetwork)</callback>.</p>
