  <p>Emotion networks let us make sense of everyone's evaluatory state:</p>

<p>We know these things because everyone is always radiating emotion tells, forming an emotion network.</p>
    
<div class="consider">
       <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
        <p class="considertext">We often don't realize how much we know from an emotion network until we think about what we know <sem>isn't</sem> going to happen.</p> 
        
        <p class="considertext">In the picture above, we know there's not going to be a fight, a nap, a dance party, screams, shared grief, and so on. We can realize we know a lot by realizing we can exclude a lot!</p> 
                 </div>
     
         <p>Within an overall network are subnetworks. At the dance hall below, we can see how people aren't splitting their attention evenly among all fifty people&mdash;instead, people give different amounts of attention to different people, leading to subneworks:</p>

<p>Similarly, at a cafe everyone is vaguely aware of everyone else <callback>(overall nework)</callback>&mdash;but different groups are more intensely aware of subsections <callback>(subnetwork)</callback>.</p>
