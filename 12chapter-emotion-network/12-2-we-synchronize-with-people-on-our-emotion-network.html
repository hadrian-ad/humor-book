<p>We use emotion networks to synchronize our evaluations together. We synchronize to reach evaluatory consensus—to get on the same emotional page:</p>

<div class="consider">
   
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">This is what Zoe did on the train. The unexpected bounce activated similar topics for all the passengers.
    
    <p class="considertext">Since Zoe didn't <term>herself</term> know how to evaluate these topics, she instead paid attention to the evaluations made by the <em>other</em> passengers—and synchronized her mistakes and OKs to theirs.</p>
