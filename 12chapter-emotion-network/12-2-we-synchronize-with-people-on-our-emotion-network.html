    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We synchronize with people on our emotion network</h1>
    

We use emotion networks to synchronize our evaluations together. We synchronize to reach evaluatory consensus.

> Consider:

This is what Zoe did on the train. The unexpected bounce gave all the passengers similar topics. Since Zoe didn't know how to evaluate these topics, she paid attention to the evaluations made by the other passengers—and synchronized her mistakes and OKs to theirs.

 



We try to synchronize with the people around us, since it feels uncomfortable to not reach evaluatory consensus:



“Shit!” Trevor drops the knife and puts his finger into his mouth. “I almost severed my pinky!” Yasmin comes over, ashen faced. Then Trevor laughs and waves his pinky. Just joking.



Yasmin laughs with relief and pulls on him in happy annoyance. “Trevor! Agh, you had me worried!” (<- Trevor and Yasmin have synchronized mistakes and OKs <-> Trevor and Yasmin have reached evaluatory consensus)

- OR -

He laughs at her reaction. Yasmin just stares at him, furious. (<- Yasmin and Trevor have unsynchronized mistakes and OKs <-> Trevor and Yasmin have not reached evaluatory consensus) 



Zoe is at a coffee shop when she hears a loud noise outside. Everyone looks around.



Some people come in the door, looking over their shoulder, smiling and joking at what they saw. Everyone relaxes. (<- coffee shop synchronizes their mistakes and OKs with people who have firsthand evaluations <-> coffee shop has reached evaluatory consensus)

- OR -

Some people go back to talking, but others are still sharing looks. There’s a bit of an uncomfortable mood in the cafe. (<- coffee shop is unable to synchronize <-> coffee shop has not reached evaluatory consensus)

 

Sam is watching Fired Fireman and laughs.



After a split second, Riley laughs too. (<- Riley synchronizes her mistakes and OKs with Sam <-> Sam and Riley have reached evaluatory consensus)

- OR –

 “What? What?” Riley says. (<- Riley is desynchronized with Sam <-> Riley feels discomfort <-> Sam and Riley have not reached evaluatory consensus)

 

Emma pulls out her phone, but is stupefied to see she accidentally grabbed Owen’s phone. Zoe doubles over with laughter at Emma’s expression.

“It’s not funny!” Emma says, still stupefied. “Where’s my phone?”



This makes Zoe laugh harder, and eventually Emma starts laughing too. (<- Emma synchronizes mistakes and OK with Zoe <-> Zoe and Emma have reached evaluatory consensus)

- OR –

This makes Zoe laugh harder, and Emma gets more and more annoyed. (<- Emma is desynchronized with Zoe <-> Zoe and Emma have not reached evaluatory consensus)

Emma: “I wish you would take this seriously.” (<- Emma tries to get Zoe to synchronize with her)

Zoe: *smiling* “Okay, okay, sorry.” (<- Zoe starts to synchronize with Emma)
