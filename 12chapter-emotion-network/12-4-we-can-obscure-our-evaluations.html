    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can obscure our evaluations on an emotion network</h1>
    
  
<p>We use emotion networks to share information about our evaluations. Sometimes the information we share is straightforwardly accurate—but other times, we obscure our evaluations:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table, and they look up at him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>*stares blankfaced*</internalaction> <notes>(&larr;Emma is guarding her evaluations)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(carefully)</internalaction> <speech>"Nice hat."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe is guarding her evaluations)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(uncomfortable)</internalaction> <speech>"Thanks."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen is uncomfortable he can’t read their true evaluations)</notes></p>   
    </div>
    
<p>We obscure our evaluations for a variety of reasons, but this isn’t particular to humor—since we also obscure anger or boredom.</p>

<p>More specifically, we’re not trying to obscure humor or anger—we're trying to obscure the size of our mistake or OK:</p>

<h2>Obscuring the size of a mistake or OK</h2>

<div class="vignette">
 <p><narration>Trevor feels ridiculous in his tiny suit. Yasmin’s extended family is chatting around him. His stomach is twisted from nervousness and he tries as hard as possible to look at ease.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor has a small OK, but tries to act as if he has a large OK)</notes></p>
 </div>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Jennifer and Amber are having coffee while Riley is playing with toy cars on the floor. Out of the blue, Riley says a slur and asks Jennifer what it means. Amber coughs and takes a drink.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Amber is amused, but tries to disguise her emotion tells)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Jennifer’s a bit shocked and embarrassed</narration> <speech>“Where did you hear that word, sweetie?”</speech> <narration>she asks, calmly.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer sees this as a large mistake, but tries to act as if it were a small mistake)</notes>
    
     </div>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Alina is uninterested in the story Hana is telling, and can’t understand why Hana thinks the subject is a big deal. But to be polite, Alina pretends to be shocked. Hana finishes her story about her burnt pizza.</narration></p> 
    <p>
    <speaker>Alina:</speaker> <internalaction>(pretending to care)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh my gosh,”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Alina sees this story as built around a small mistake, but tries to act as if she saw it as a big mistake)</notes>

<p>Often, the better we know someone's emotion profile, the better we can draw accurate information from both obscured and transparent evaluations. This is one reason it's often easier to generate humor with our friends than with strangers.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
        <p class="considertext">One reason some people connect quicker with strangers is that they're transparent on their emotion network—they're not trying to obscure things.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">This lets others feel comfortable synchronizing with them and generating humor with them—which allows them to reach humor family words faster, like <emotions>belonging</emotions>, <emotions>connection</emotions>, <emotions>welcome</emotions>, and so on.
    </p>

        <p class="considertext">We're also familiar with our friends' emotion profile, which lets us gather information about their emotional state better in general—obscuring or transparent—than we would if we were observing them for the first time.</p>

   <p><headline>Sensuous.</headline> Emotion networks are sensuous systems. They can be felt or described as colorful, expressive, in motion, intense, noisy, physical, quiet, subtle, warm, and so on. They’re also:</p> 
    
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Spatial.</strong> Someone’s emotion tells takes up space—like how whispering under a blanket or shouting in an empty ballroom has a spatial dimension to it. When we close a door to shut out another conversation, we’re spatially changing how our emotion network works. </li>
        
    <li><strong>Unique.</strong> An emotion network is composed of unique evaluators, as well as taking place in a unique circumstances in a distinct space. This is why the feeling of an emotion network changes when someone leaves or enters a room—the composition changes. For this reason, each emotion network is never the same twice, and always has a distinct flavor.
                </li>    
        
        <li><strong>Aesthetic.</strong> Emotion networks can be captivating, and permeate everything around us. They can include the way voices sound and interact with spatial acoustics; the way people sit or dress; the way chairs or clothes feel; the smell of the place we’ve chosen to gather; and so on—all of which can contribute to how we express and understand emotion tells.</li>
        </ul> 
    
    <p>These combine into how we think about emotion networks. Being around the <term>same</term> friend is <em>different</em> depending on whether we're lounging by the pool with them or sitting together on a terrace at a formal restaurant. The space and the aesthetics shape our emotion network, which contribute to these being <term>emotionally</term> different experiences. </p>
