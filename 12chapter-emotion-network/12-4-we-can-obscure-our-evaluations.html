<h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can obscure our evaluations</h1>
    
<p>We use emotion networks to share information about our evaluations. Sometimes, our evaluations are shared transparently—but other times, we obscure our evaluations:</p>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table, and they look up at him.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>*stares blankfaced*</internalaction> <notes>(&larr;Emma is guarding her evaluations)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(carefully)</internalaction> <speech>"Nice hat."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Zoe is guarding her evaluations)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(uncomfortable)</internalaction> <speech>"Thanks."</speech> <notes>(&larr;Owen is uncomfortable he can’t read their true evaluations)</notes></p>   
    </div>
    
<p>We obscure our evaluations for a variety of reasons, but this isn’t particular to <term>humor</term>—since we also obscure <em>anger</em> or <em>boredom</em>.</p>

<p>More specifically, we’re not trying to obscure an emotion, like humor or anger—we're trying to obscure the size of our mistake or OK:</p>

<div class="vignette">
 <p><narration>Trevor feels ridiculous in his tiny suit. Yasmin’s extended family is chatting around him. His stomach is twisted from nervousness and he tries as hard as possible to look at ease.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor has a small OK, but tries to act as if he has a large OK)</notes></p>
 </div>

 
<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Jennifer and Amber are having coffee while Riley is playing with toy cars on the floor. Out of the blue, Riley says a slur and asks Jennifer what it means. Amber coughs and takes a drink.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Amber is amused, but tries to disguise her emotion tells)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Jennifer’s a bit shocked and embarrassed</narration> <speech>“Where did you hear that word, sweetie?”</speech> <narration>she asks, calmly.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Jennifer sees this as a large mistake, but tries to act as if it were a small mistake)</notes>
    
     </div>

<div class="vignette">
<p>
    <narration>Alina is uninterested in the story Hana is telling, and can’t understand why Hana thinks the subject is a big deal. But to be polite, Alina pretends to be shocked. Hana finishes her story about her burnt pizza.</narration></p> 
    <p>
    <speaker>Alina:</speaker> <internalaction>(pretending to care)</internalaction> <speech>“Oh my gosh,”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Alina sees this story as built around a small mistake, but tries to act as if she saw it as a big mistake)</notes>

<p>Often, the better we know someone's <a href="../9chapter-humor-profile/9-0-humor-profile.html">emotion profile</a>, the better we can draw accurate information from both obscured and transparent evaluations. This is one reason it's often easier to generate humor with our friends than with strangers.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
        <p class="considertext">Some people connect quicker than others with classmates, coworkers, strangers, and so on. One reason for this is that they're transparant about their evaluations. By not obscuring their evaluations, others have access to the information they need to generate humor with them.</p>
        
        <p class="considertext">Sometimes we think being "open" means sharing intimate or vulnerable thoughts and memories. But usually, it more means being transparent with our evaluations.</p>

        <p class="considertext">We're also familiar with our friends' emotion profile, which lets us gather information about their emotional state better in general—obscuring or transparent—than we would if we were observing them for the first time.</p>

   <p><headline>Physical.</headline> Emotion networks are sensual systems&mdash;they can be felt or described as colorful, expressive, in motion, intense, noisy, physical, quiet, subtle, warm, and so on. They’re also:</p> 
    
    <ul>
       <li><strong>Spatial.</strong> Someone’s emotion tells takes up space—like how whispering under a blanket or shouting in an empty ballroom has a spatial dimension to it. When we close a door to shut out another conversation, we’re spatially changing how our emotion network works. </li>
        
    <li><strong>Unique.</strong> An emotion network is composed of unique evaluators, as well as taking place in a unique circumstances in a distinct space. This is why the feeling of an emotion network changes when someone leaves or enters a room, or even when a chair is removed&mdash;the composition changes. Each emotion network is never the same twice.
                </li>    
        
        <li><strong>Aesthetic.</strong> Emotion networks can be captivating, and permeate everything around us. They can include the way voices sound and interact with spatial acoustics; the way people sit or dress; the way chairs or clothes feel; the smell of the place we’ve chosen to gather; and so on—all of which can contribute to how we express and understand emotion tells.</li>
        </ul> 
    
    <p>These combine into how we think about emotion networks. Being around the <term>same</term> friend is <em>different</em> depending on whether we're lounging by the pool with them or sitting together on a terrace at a formal restaurant.</p>
