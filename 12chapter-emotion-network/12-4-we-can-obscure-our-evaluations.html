    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We can obscure our evaluations on an emotion network</h1>
    
  
We use emotion networks to share evaluatory information, and sometimes this evaluatory information is straightforwardly accurate—but other times, we obscure our evaluations:

 

Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table, and they look up at him. Emma stares at him, blank-faced. (<- Emma is guarding her evaluations) “Nice hat,” Zoe says carefully. (<- Zoe is guarding her evaluations) “Thanks,” Owen says, uncomfortable. (<- Owen is uncomfortable he can’t read their true evaluations) 

We obscure our evaluations when we feel our evaluations would be burdensome for others to synchronize toward. This isn’t particular to humor though—since we also obscure anger or boredom.

More specifically, we’re not obscuring humor or anger—we're trying to obscure the size of our mistake or OK:

Obscuring the size of a mistake or OK

Trevor feels ridiculous in his tiny suit. Yasmin’s extended family is chatting around him. His stomach is twisted from nervousness and he tries as hard as possible to look at ease. (<- Trevor has a small OK, but tries to act as if he has a large OK)

 

Jennifer and Amber are having coffee while Riley is playing with toy cars on the floor. Out of the blue, Riley says a slur and asks Jennifer what it means. Amber coughs and takes a drink. (<- Amber is amused, but tries to disguise her emotion tells) Jennifer’s a bit shocked and embarrassed. “Where did you hear that word, sweetie?” she asks, calmly. (<- Jennifer sees this as a large mistake, but tries to act as if it were a small mistake)

 

Alina is uninterested in the story Hana is telling, and can’t understand why Hana thinks the subject is a big deal. But to be polite, Alina pretends to be shocked. Hana finishes her story about her burnt pizza. “Oh my gosh,” Alina says, trying to pretend she cares. (<- Alina sees this story as built around a small mistake, but tries to act as if she saw it as a big mistake) 

We're often transparent about our evaluations with our friends—which is one of the reasons it's easier to generate humor with friends than strangers. With friends, we often have better access to the information we need to help shift their mistakes and OKs into balance!

 

 

Sensuous. Emotion networks are sensuous systems. They can be felt or described as colorful, expressive, in motion, intense, noisy, physical, quiet, subtle, warm, and so on. They’re also: 

Spatial. Someone’s emotion tells takes up space—like how whispering under a blanket or shouting in an empty ballroom has a spatial dimension to it. When we close a door to shut out another conversation, we’re spatially changing how our emotion network works. 
Unique. An emotion network is composed of unique evaluators, as well as taking place in a unique circumstances in a distinct space. This is why the feeling of an emotion network changes when someone leaves or enters a room—the composition changes. This is why each emotion network is never the same twice, and always has a distinct flavor.
Aesthetic. Emotion networks can be captivating, and permeate everything around us. They can include the way voices sound and interact with spatial acoustics; the way people sit or dress; the way chairs or clothes feel; the smell of the place we’ve chosen to gather; and so on—all of which can contribute to how we express and understand emotion tells. 
These combine into how we think about emotion networks. Being around the same friends is different depending on whether we're lounging by the pool with them or sitting together on a terrace at a formal restaurant. The space and the aesthetics shape our emotion network, which contribute to these being emotionally different experiences.
