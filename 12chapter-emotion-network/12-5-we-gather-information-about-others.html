    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We gather information about others from our emotion network
 </h1>
    
 <p>We use our emotion network for all kinds of things:</p>

<h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem">We can form groups with our emotion network</h3>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Xiaowei and Lina find Damien sitting by himself.</narration> <speech>“Want to come sit with us?”</speech> <narration>Xiaowei asks. Damien gathers his lunch bag and sits with them.</narration></p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>Xiaowei and Lina are making each other laugh, and are explaining inside jokes to Damien. After a while, Damien starts smiling and showing humor tells.</narration> <notes>(&larr;as people synchronize their evaluatory information, they start forming a group)</notes>
    </p>
    </div>
 

<h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem">We can link to an emotion network</h3>

<div class="vignette">
   <p>
       <narration>Santiago is leading a youth camp, and the middle schoolers are a bit nervous around each other the first day.</narration> <notes>(&larr;middle schoolers start synchronizing over their emotion network, but are cautious until they synchronize more on more active topics)</notes>
   </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>As the facilitator, Santiago notes when humor tells start appearing, which indicate they’re transitioning into feeling safe.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Santiago can pull information off their emotion network)</notes>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <narration>Santiago tries to observe them individually to track how each one is feeling, and makes an effort to include kids that are showing fewer tells.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Santiago uses their emotion network to identify where he thinks he should intervene)</notes>
    </p>
    </div> 

<h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem">We can foster trust or distrust on a network</h3>

<div class="vignette">
   <p>
       <speech>“Shit!”</speech> <narration>Trevor drops the knife and puts his finger into his mouth.</narration> <speech>“I almost severed my pinky!”</speech> <narration>Yasmin comes over, ashen-faced. Then Trevor waves his pinky. Just joking. He laughs at her reaction.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Trevor deceives Yasmin)</notes>
   </p>
    
    <p><narration>Yasmin just stares at him, furious.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin is angry that Trevor abused the trust she had put in their emotion network)</notes> </p>
    </div>
    
<h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem">We can become aware when a network is desynchronized</h3>

<div class="vignette">
   <p>
       <narration>Amaya is at Minh’s apartment, and they’re joking and having fun. They start kissing, and Amaya is enjoying herself. She tosses off her shirt and starts massaging Minh over his pants. She stops when she realizes that he’s lost his humor tells. Is he not feeling comfortable or safe right now? Embarrassed and concerned, she leans back and they talk for a while.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Amaya realizes she’s desynchronized with Minh, and pauses to resynchronize)</notes>
   </p> 
    </div>
    
<h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem">We can see ranks within networks</h3>

<div class="vignette">
  <p> <narration>Jessica is drinking a can of sweet tea, and Elias is looking at it.</narration> <speech>“That’s the difference between here and there,”</speech> <narration>he says, amused.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speech>“What is?”</speech> <narration>she asks.</narration></p>
    
    <p>
        <speech>“You wouldn’t get it. Swee-tea.”</speech> <narration>He says. He laughs.</narration> <notes>(&larr;since Elias doesn’t bother resynchronizing with Jessica, we can see he sees her as a less important part of the network)</notes>
    </p> 
    </div>
    
<h3 style="margin-top: 1.5rem">Someone can join a network to determine evaluations</h3>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Justin and Heather are mountain biking when Justin flips on a root and tumbles down a small hill.</narration> <speech>“Oh my god! Justin! Are you okay?”</speech> <narration>Heather calls, jumping off her bike and scrambling down to the body and bike below.</narration></p> 
   
 <p><narration>Justin stirs and sits up.</narration> <speech>“Oof,”</speech> <narration>he says, adjusting his helmet shakily.</narration> <speech>“I’m fine!”</speech> <narration>he says. They look at each other and start giggling with relief.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>A stranger watches the fall, horrified, and runs over. When he sees them giggling he slows down.</narration> <notes>(&larr;stranger uses humor tells to gauge severity of the consequences)</notes> <speech>“Bad fall there! You okay?”</speech> <narration>he asks, just to be polite. Justin nods and waves appreciatively.</narration></p>
    </div>

<p>In all these examples, people were sharing and receiving information about emotional states—evaluations were reactively passing back and forth on emotion networks. This is an indispensable part of how we communicate with others.

<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Medium.</headline> Emotion networks are important! We can't ignore them—trying to learn about humor without mentioning emotion networks would be like trying to learn about fish without mentioning water.</p>
     
<p>When we think about the people in our lives who have been good at making others laugh, we'll notice that there's often a field-like quality of influence on people around them, and an acute understanding of the situational zeitgeist. In other words, they're skilled at being able to see, interpret, and act within these emotion networks—which is inseparable from their skill at making others laugh.</p>
     
 <p>We can improve at our skill at making people laugh. But doing so effectively requires thinking about the broader system of how people share evaluations with each other. As we become comfortable seeing and thinking about this process, we'll become increasingly capable at generating humor.</p>
