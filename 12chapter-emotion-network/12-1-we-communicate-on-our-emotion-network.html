<p>Once our emotion network is pointed out, we notice it everywhere:</p>

<p>Everyone on the train was sharing their evaluations of mistakes and OKs. Zoe was able to synchronize her evaluations to theirs <callback>("they're not worried so I'm not worried")</callback>—even though she was around people she didn’t know and who spoke a different language than her.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Everyone else on the train could also assess Zoe’s evaluations of mistakes and OKs, just like she could theirs. Unless there's a substantial emotional <a href="../10chapter-spectator-entertainment/10-5-spectator-entertainment-has-a-screen.html">screen</a>, like if we’re watching people in a recording or looking at them from a window—we can’t <term>receive</term> information from an emotion network without also <em>putting in</em> information.</p>
    </div>
    
<p>We do this whenever we’re around others, on everything—even when the subject seems inconsequential. Below, Owen gets feedback on his new hat through his emotion network:</p> 

<div class="vignette">
    
    <p><narration>Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table, and they look up at him.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>A.</strong> <speaker>Emma:</speaker> <action>*stares blankfaced*</action></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(carefully)</internalaction> "Nice hat."</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(uncomfortable)</internalaction> "Thanks." <notes>(&larr;Owen determines from Emma and Zoe that they see the hat as a mistake and that they are unsure if it’s OK)</notes></p>    
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>B.</strong> <narration>Zoe and Emma laugh.</narration></p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Zoe:</speaker> <internalaction>(admiringly)</internalaction> "Nice hat, man!"</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <internalaction>(pleased)</internalaction> <internalaction>(happily)</internalaction> "Thanks! <notes>(&larr;Owen determines that Zoe and Emma see the hat as a mistake but that they feel it’s OK)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p class="vig-indent"><strong>C.</strong> <narration>Zoe and Emma barely glance at Owen. He was hoping for a bit of a reaction—but at least it must look normal.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Owen determines that Zoe and Emma see the hat as not a mistake and so without negative consequences)</notes></p>
    
    
    </div>

<p>Owen isn't focused so much on literal statements made by Zoe and Emma. Instead, he pays attention to what he learns over their emotion network. This provides the the evaluatory context for everything happening.

<div class="box">
   <p><headline>Communal sense.</headline> Our emotional state isn’t private—to varying degrees, our emotional state is common information to everyone around us, just like theirs are to us. Our ability to pick up on these collective evaluations is almost like a sense—a “communal” sense.</p>
    
    <p>For many of us, our communal sense is so obvious that we only notice it when we <sem-weak>don’t</sem-weak> have it. For instance, when we go up to give our big presentation, we can get so nervous that we lose our ability to see our audience's emotion tells as coherent information.</p>
    
    <p>We can still <sem-weak>see</sem-weak> the audience when this happens—we just lose ability to interpret their emotional state. This can be as disorienting as losing any other sense, and when it happens we can feel socially unmoored and vulnerable.</p>
