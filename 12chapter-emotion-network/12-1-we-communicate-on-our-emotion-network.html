    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">We communicate on our emotion network</h1>
    
   
 Once our emotion network is pointed out, we notice it everywhere: 

Emotions as a communication system

Zoe is backpacking in Brazil. The train she’s on gives a frightening bounce. Alarmed, she looks around.



A. The bounce made the commuters sit up and mutter darkly to each other. Zoe’s heart continues to pound. (<- Zoe determines from others that the bounce was a mistake and not OK)



B. The bounce made the commuters sit up and laugh and chat with each other. Zoe relaxes a bit. (<- Zoe determines from others that the bounce was a mistake but OK)



C. All the commuters seem bored and uninterested. She calms down. (<- Zoe determines from others that the bounce was not a mistake and so was OK)





Everyone on the train was sharing their evaluations of mistakes and OKs—and Zoe was able to synchronize her evaluations to theirs, even though she was around people she didn’t know and who spoke a different language than her.

> Consider:

Everyone else on the train could also assess Zoe’s evaluations of mistakes and OKs, just like she could theirs. Unless there's a substantial emotional screen—like if we’re watching people in a recording or looking at them from a window—we can’t receive information from an emotion network without also putting information in.

We do this whenever we’re around others, on everything—even when the subject seems inconsequential. Below, Owen gets feedback on his hat through his emotion network: 

Emotions as an everyday communication system

Owen decides to wear a hat for the first time. He sits down at Zoe and Emma’s table, and they look up at him.



A. Emma stares at him, blank-faced.

“Nice hat,” Zoe says carefully. “Thanks,” Owen says, uncomfortable. (<- Owen determines from Emma and Zoe that they see the hat as a mistake and that they are unsure if it’s OK)



B. Zoe and Emma laugh.

“Nice hat, man!” Zoe says, admiringly. Owen is pleased. “Thanks!” he says, happily. (<- Owen determines that Zoe and Emma see the hat as a mistake but that they feel it’s OK)



C. Zoe and Emma barely glance at him. He was hoping for a bit of a reaction—but at least it must look normal. (<- Owen determines that Zoe and Emma see the hat as not a mistake and so without negative consequences)





  



Communal sense. Our emotional state isn’t private—to varying degrees, our emotional state is common information to everyone around us, just like theirs are to us. Our ability to pick up on these collective evaluations is almost like a sense—a “communal” sense.
For many of us, our communal sense is so obvious that we only notice it when we don’t have it. For instance, when we go up to give our big presentation, we can get so nervous that we lose our ability to register our audience's emotion tells as coherent information.

We can still see the audience when this happens—we just lose ability to interpret their emotional state. This can be as disorienting as losing any other sense, and we can feel socially unmoored and vulnerable when this happens.
