    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Emotion networks are why we can communicate without words</h1>
    

<p>Our emotion network lets us think about how we communicate without speaking. Our emotion network is how we can:</p>
<ul class="close-list">
    <li>assemble things together <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>assign tasks with a specified degree of urgency <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>claim a section of a beach <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>express affection <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>fan out to search for something <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>flirt with someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>indicate something with a specified degree of permissiveness <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>organize ourselves on a bus <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show that we’re unbothered <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show support <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>walk around busy streets <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>welcome someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Often, this process is even more obvious in dramatic circumstances, like when:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>awareness of a shocking event trickles from one end of the bar to everyone else <callback>(without spoken explanation)</callback></li>
    <li>belligerent attitudes harden people into groups <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>fear travels throughout a city <callback>(without spoken reasoning)</callback></li>
    <li>festive attitudes draw people together <callback>(without spoken invitation)</callback></li>
    <li>good news ripples through a classroom <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>a restaurant suddenly falls silent <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>uncertainty sweeps through a train <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>worried crowds soften into release and celebration <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>We carefully notice these evaluative changes—since we usually think evaluations are  <em>more</em> important than the context.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">If we're about to go into a bar, we don't care so much <term>what</term> people are talking about. We instead care about <em>how</em> they're talking about things—whether they're afraid, belligerent, laughing, relaxed, and so on.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">Similarly, if a bar we're in suddenly goes silent, we'll go silent too—since our first concern isn't <term>what</term> happened, it's how people <em>feel</em> about what happened.</p>    
    </div>
    
    <p>This all is important to humor. A lot of humor happens simply by exchanging smiles—or watching happy people celebrate—or through wordless interactions.</p> 

<p>But this isn't specific to <term>humor</term>—it's the same for any emotion. A lot of <em>anger</em> happens simply by exchanging looks, or by listening to angry people.</p>

<p>We don't always have words for how this happens. But being able to talk about it is necessary to broad understanding of humor.</p>

<p>We'll use <term>emotion networks</term>—and how our evaluations are either <term>synchronized</term> or <term>desynchronized</term> on them—throughout this book as a way of talking about how evaluations are transferred between people.</p>
 

 
<div class="box">
    <p><headline>Intentional.</headline> Sometimes our emotion network feels indirect and outside our control, like how we just ambiently know if everyone is anxious or calm. But other times, we can intentionally use our emotion network to communicate things, like when we:</p>
    
    <ul class="close-list">
       <li>see someone we know through a window, and we can’t hear each other</li>
        <li>give silent goodbyes because a baby is sleeping</li>
        <li>wordlessly express approval at the movie theater</li>
        <li>alert someone who has headphones on</li>
        <li>indicate to our partner that we want to leave at a party</li>
        <li>share a nice moment with someone</li>
        </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 
    
    <p>In these cases, we're making active use of our emotion network. We often have the same feeling when we're making others feel humor: often generating humor in someone is in the way we smile, share looks, tilt our head, and so on. The foundation of generating humor in others happens in this exchange of emotion tells on our emotion network.</p>
