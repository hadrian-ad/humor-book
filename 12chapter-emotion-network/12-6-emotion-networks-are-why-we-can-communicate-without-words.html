    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Emotion networks are why we can communicate without words</h1>
    

<p>Our emotion network lets us think about how we communicate without speaking. Our emotion network is how we can:</p>
<ul class="close-list">
    <li>assemble things together <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>assign tasks with a specified degree of urgency <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>claim a section of a beach <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>express affection <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>fan out to search for something <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>flirt with someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>indicate something with a specified degree of permissiveness <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>organize ourselves on a bus <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show that we’re unbothered <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show support <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>walk around busy streets <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>welcome someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Often, this process is even more obvious in dramatic circumstances, like when:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>awareness of a shocking event trickles from one end of the bar to everyone else <callback>(without spoken explanation)</callback></li>
    <li>belligerent attitudes harden people into groups <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>fear travels throughout a city <callback>(without spoken reasoning)</callback></li>
    <li>festive attitudes draw people together <callback>(without spoken invitation)</callback></li>
    <li>good news ripples through a classroom <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>a restaurant suddenly falls silent <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>uncertainty sweeps through a train <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>worried crowds soften into release and celebration <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>We carefully notice these evaluative changes—since we usually think evaluations are <sem>more</sem> important than the context.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">If we're about to go into a bar, we don't care so much <term>what</term> people are talking about. We instead care about <em>how</em> they're talking about things—whether they're afraid, belligerent, laughing, relaxed, and so on.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">Similarly, if a bar we're in suddenly goes silent, we'll go silent too—since our first concern isn't <term>what</term> happened, it's how people <em>feel</em> about what happened.</p>    
    </div>
    
    <p>This all is important to humor. A lot of humor happens simply by exchanging smiles—or watching happy people celebrate—or through wordless interactions.</p> 

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    <p class="considertext">This isn't specific to <term>humor</term>—it's the same for <em>any</em> emotion. A lot of anger happens simply by exchanging looks, or by listening to angry people.</p>
</div>

<p>We don't always have words for how this happens. But being able to talk about it is necessary to broad understanding of humor.</p>

<p>We'll use emotion networks throughout this book as a way of talking about how evaluations are transferred between people.</p>
 
 <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Medium.</headline> Emotion networks are important! We can't ignore them—trying to learn about humor without mentioning emotion networks would be like trying to learn about fish without mentioning water.</p>
     
<p>When we think about the people in our lives who have been good at making others laugh, we'll notice that they often have a field-like quality of influence on people around them, along with an acute understanding of the situational zeitgeist.</p> 
    
    <p>In other words, they're skilled at being able to see, interpret, and act within these emotion networks! This skill is inseparable from their broader skill at making others laugh. As we improve our ability to see and think about emotion networks, our broader skill at making others laugh improves as well. </p>
     </div>

 
     
     
         <div class="chapter-end">
    <p>That's the end of this chapter! Next, we'll see what kind of information is communicated over emotion networks.</p>

<p>People have informational tension between them. As people increase their attention to each other’s emotional state, they increase this informational tension—pulling them together. This <vocab>human surface tension</vocab> is what makes groups groups:</p>

<p>We can see the degrees of human surface tension any time we look at any groups of people:</p>

<p>We increase or decrease this informational tension by how much mutual attention we give each other:</p>

<p>Human surface tension lets us think about what makes individual people part of groups—and how subnetworks form and fluctuate on an emotion network:</p>

<img src=../images/12c-images-emotion-network/12-6-information-tension-interval/12-6-6-surface-tension-is-networks.png

    alt="";
    title="";
    style="max-width: ; margin-left: " 
     >

<p>These groupings are fluid and can quickly change over time—since we’re constantly changing which people we put effort into sharing and receiving information with.</p> 

<p>We can see arrangements, degrees, and changes of human surface tension whenever we look at anyone. We can see this in some pictures:</p>


<img src=../images/12c-images-emotion-network/12-6-information-tension-interval/12-6-7-surface-tension-examples.png

     >



<p>In each of these pictures, the human surface tension is fluid and tangible—it's the constantly changing degree of informational exchange between people. </p>

<p>One of the ways we improve at generating humor is by improving our awareness and control around human surface tension. We enable connective and precise humor by increasing our informational tension with someone—otherwise, we simply have no way to reactively shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor.</p>

<p>Our ability to handle human surface tension is what enables us to form or disband groups. While this skill is broader than just "humor," it's also essential to any skill around humor.</p>
