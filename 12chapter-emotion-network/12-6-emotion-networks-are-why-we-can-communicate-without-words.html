    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">Emotion networks are why we can communicate without words</h1>
    

<p>Our emotion network lets us think about how we communicate without speaking. Our emotion network is how we can:</p>
<ul class="close-list">
    <li>assemble things together <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>assign tasks with a specified degree of urgency <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>claim a section of a beach <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>express affection <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>fan out to search for something <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>flirt with someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>indicate something with a specified degree of permissiveness <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>organize ourselves on a bus <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show that we’re unbothered <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>show support <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>walk around busy streets <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    <li>welcome someone <callback>(without speaking)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Often, this process is even more obvious in dramatic circumstances, like when:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>awareness of a shocking event trickles from one end of the bar to everyone else <callback>(without spoken explanation)</callback></li>
    <li>belligerent attitudes harden people into groups <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>fear travels throughout a city <callback>(without spoken reasoning)</callback></li>
    <li>festive attitudes draw people together <callback>(without spoken invitation)</callback></li>
    <li>good news ripples through a classroom <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>a restaurant suddenly falls silent <callback>(without spoken declaration)</callback></li>
    <li>uncertainty sweeps through a train <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    <li>worried crowds soften into release and celebration <callback>(without spoken announcement)</callback></li>
    </ul>
<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>We carefully notice these evaluative changes—since we usually think evaluations are  <em>more</em> important than the context.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">If we're about to go into a bar, we don't care so much <term>what</term> people are talking about. We instead care about <em>how</em> they're talking about things—whether they're afraid, belligerent, laughing, relaxed, and so on.</p> 
   
   <p class="considertext">Similarly, if a bar we're in suddenly goes silent, we'll go silent too—since our first concern isn't <term>what</term> happened, it's how people <em>feel</em> about what happened.</p>    
    </div>
    
    <p>This all is important to humor. A lot of humor happens simply by exchanging smiles—or watching happy people celebrate—or through wordless interactions.</p> 

<p>But this isn't specific to <term>humor</term>—it's the same for any emotion. A lot of <em>anger</em> happens simply by exchanging looks, or by listening to angry people.</p>

<p>We don't always have words for how this happens. But being able to talk about it is necessary to broad understanding of humor.</p>

<p>We'll use <term>emotion networks</term>—and how our evaluations are either <term>synchronized</term> or <term>desynchronized</term> on them—throughout this book as a way of talking about how evaluations are transferred between people.</p>
 
 <div class="box">
    <p><headline>Medium.</headline> Emotion networks are important! We can't ignore them—trying to learn about humor without mentioning emotion networks would be like trying to learn about fish without mentioning water.</p>
     
<p>When we think about the people in our lives who have been good at making others laugh, we'll notice that there's often a field-like quality of influence on people around them, and an acute understanding of the situational zeitgeist. In other words, they're skilled at being able to see, interpret, and act within these emotion networks—which is inseparable from their skill at making others laugh.</p>
     
 <p>We can improve at our skill at making people laugh. But doing so effectively requires thinking about the broader system of how people share evaluations with each other. As we become comfortable seeing and thinking about this process, we'll become increasingly capable at generating humor.</p>

    <div class="content">

<p>Each evaluator is constantly radiating their evaluations to other evaluators. This creates a potential or actual network of evaluation. These <vocab>emotion networks</vocab> are foundational parts of communication, and are the medium where humor happens.</p>

<ul>
   <li>We automatically become part of emotion networks whenever we're around others.</li> 
    
   <li>We synchronize evaluations over emotion networks. When we don't feel synchronized on an emotion network, we feel uncomfortable.</li> 
    
    <li>There can be emotion networks within emotion networks. These subnetworks try to stay synchronized on more minute topics.</li>
