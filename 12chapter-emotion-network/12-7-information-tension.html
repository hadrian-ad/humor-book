   People have informational tension between them. As people increase their attention to each other’s emotional state, they increase this informational tension—pulling them together. This “human surface tension” is what makes groups groups:

 

We can see the degrees of human surface tension any time we look at any groups of people:


Zoe and Emma are walking down the campus quad, arguing about which dinosaur would make the best pet. (<- high surface tension) They pass someone relaxing on a bench. They register basic things about that person’s emotional state, but don’t put in any more effort to register his evaluatory state. (<- low surface tension)





We increase or decrease this informational tension by how much mutual attention we give each other:



Owen goes to office hours to speak to Justin. Owen pokes his head in.

Justin: “Come in!” *typing* “Hang on, I’ll be with you in just a second… Have a seat!”

Owen: *sits* (<- lack of attention decreases human surface tension)

Justin: *typing* *finishing email* *swivels* *looks at Owen* *puts hands together* “Okay. Now, what can I do for you?” (<- attention increases human surface tension)

Owen hates talking to professors. He always feels tongue-tied.  







Owen goes up to the register. The barista is busy at the espresso machine. (<- low human surface tension) She glances over and gives a smile of recognition. 

Barista: “Hey! I’ll be right with you.” 

Owen: *smiles* “Okay!” (<- mutual attention increases human surface tension)

The barista goes back to making her drink. (<- reduction of mutual attention decreases human surface tension)







A teacher corners Sam to complain. Sam nods and listens carefully, but Heather keeps going on and on. After about ten minutes, Sam briefly checks his phone, trying to signal to her that it’s time to wrap up the conversation.  





Zoe is reading on the bus. Someone sits next to her. (<- low human surface tension) She can feel him look over at her book. (<- increased human surface tension)

Stranger: “Watcha reading?” (<- stranger tries to increase surface tension)

Zoe: *not looking up* “Just an assignment.” (<- Zoe tries to decrease surface tension)

Stranger: “Oh so you’re a student!” (<- stranger tries to increase surface tension)

Zoe says something noncommittal and shifts to try to show she’s focusing on the book. (<- Zoe tries to decrease surface tension)







Damien sees Xiaowei and Lina come over, and dreads having to talk to people.

Xiaowei: “Want to come sit with us?”

Damien gathers his lunch bag and sits with them. They include him in their conversation, and explain some of their inside jokes to him, and he starts to join the discussion more fully. (<- Xiaowei and Lina increase surface tension with Damien)



 

Human surface tension lets us think about what makes individual people part of groups—and how subnetworks form and fluctuate on an emotion network:



 

These groupings are fluid and can quickly change over time—since we’re constantly changing which people we put effort into sharing and receiving information with. 

We can see arrangements, degrees, and changes of human surface tension whenever we look at anyone. We can see this in some pictures:






In each of these pictures, the human surface tension is fluid and tangible—it's the constantly changing degree of informational exchange between people. 

One of the ways we improve at generating humor is by improving our awareness and control around human surface tension. We enable connective, precise humor by increasing our informational tension with someone—otherwise, we simply have no way to reactively shift mistakes and OKs to generate humor.

Our ability to handle human surface tension is what enables us to form or disband groups. This skill is broader than just "humor," but is essential at any skill around humor.
