    <h1 id="exclude-navigation">12. Emotion network</h1>
    
   
We use emotions to communicate with each other. Our emotion tells project information about our emotional state:



We're communicating this information every moment of our lives:

 

Emma is sniffling on the bus from sadness, her eyes red. The people around her are aware that she’s sad. (<- emotion tells as a communication system)

 

Zoe asks Emma if she wants to go to a movie, and Emma says sure. At hearing her tone of voice, Zoe pauses and evaluates Emma’s downcast posture and red eyes. “You sure?” she asks, concerned. (<- emotion tells as a communication system)

 

While waiting for the Fired Fireman screening to start, Emma perks up, which makes Zoe feel happy. (<- emotion tells as a communication system)

Everyone around Emma could take information from her emotion tells—even people who didn’t know her:



This information goes both ways—people could read Emma’s emotion tells, just like Emma could read theirs. Whenever we're around others, we can’t help but share and receive information. 

This system is our “emotion network.” We join these networks automatically, whenever we're around others:



Our emotion network is why being at a cafe doesn’t feel the same as drinking coffee alone at home—since being around others feels intensely different than just being by ourselves:



For most of us, the fact that we’re aware of what other people are feeling is so obvious, it’s almost hard to think about—it’s invisibly normal, like breathing. But by focusing on this, we’ll be able to make sense of what humor is doing in our lives, and why. 

We'll be going over this in the rest of this chapter.

 

 

Emotional communication. We radiate information about our emotional state in all kinds of ways. For instance, if we're at a movie theater, we can pick up on the emotion tells of the audience around us—even in the dark, around people we don’t know, facing away from them, in a noisy environment, and so on.

We do this through the tone of their whispering, style of shifting, rustling of candy packets, tone and duration of laughter, exclamations, rate of bathroom-leaving, and so on. Everyone is constantly radiating information about their emotional state, which we pick up in all kinds of ways.
