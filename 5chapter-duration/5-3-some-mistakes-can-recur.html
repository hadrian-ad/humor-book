Some mistakes recur 
</h3>
  
<p>
	Some things only produce mistakes once&mdash;like the punchline of a joke. 
</p>
<p>
	The <term>first</term> time we hear the punchline, it <term>deviates</term> from our expectations. The <term2>second</term2> time we hear the punchline, it's already <term2>become</term2> our expectations&mdash;so there's no mistake:

<p>
	But things are different when things deviate from integrated expectations&mdash;since then mistakes can be felt repeatedly at a high size:

<p>
	So some things generate humor three days in a row <callback>(putting on glasses)</callback>, but other things don't <callback>(hearing a joke)</callback>&mdash;which is partially determined by how integrated our expectations are.

            Mistakes can also recur in a way that doesn't repeatedly generate <term>humor</term>, but repeatedly generates <term2>mistake-predominant</term2> emotions instead:
