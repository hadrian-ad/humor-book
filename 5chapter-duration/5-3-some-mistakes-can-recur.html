Some mistakes can recur 
</h1>
  
<p>
	Some things only produce mistakes once—like the punchline of a joke. 
</p>
<p>
	The <term>first</term> time we hear the punchline, it <em>deviates</em> from our expectations. The <term>second</term> time, the punchline has <em>become</em>	our expectations—so there's no mistake:

	But things are different when we have durable expectations. We can often feel mistakes multiple times from these expectations:

<h2>Mistake does recur</h2>

	So some things do generate humor three days in a row <callback>(putting on glasses)</callback>, but other things don't <callback>(hearing a joke)</callback>. This is determined by the durability of our expectations.

        We can use humor to draw information about people. With someone's <em>intensity</em> of humor, we learn about the <term>size</term> of their evaluations—with someone's <em>duration</em> of humor, we learn about the <term>durability</term> of their expectations.
