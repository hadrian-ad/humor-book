Some mistakes recur 
</h1>
  
<p>
	Some things only produce mistakes once—like the punchline of a joke. 
</p>
<p>
	The <term>first</term> time we hear the punchline, it <term>deviates</term> from our expectations. The <em>second</em> time we hear the punchline, it's already <em>become</em> our expectations—so there's no mistake:

<p>
	But things are different when things deviate from settled expectations—since mistakes can be felt repeatedly when they go against our settled expectations:

	So some things can generate humor three days in a row <callback>(putting on glasses)</callback>, but other things can't <callback>(hearing a joke)</callback>&mdash;which is partially determined by how settled our expectations are.

        Mistakes can also recur in a way that doesn't repeatedly generate <term>humor</term>, but repeatedly generates <em>mistake-predominant</em> emotions instead:
