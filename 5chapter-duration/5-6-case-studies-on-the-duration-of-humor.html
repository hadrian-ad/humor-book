    Case studies on the duration of humor
</h1>
  <!-- 05.60 -->

<p>
	Putting everything together, we can think about why a specific instance of humor was as short or long as it was:
</p>

<h2><outcome-contrast>Short</outcome-contrast> duration of humor</h2>
<div class="h2">
    <div class="vignette">
    <p>
        <narration>Trevor is talking the dog out at night. As General Zod squats to pee, Trevor looks into the nearby patch of dark trees, and a deep fear comes over him.</narration></p>
        
    <p><narration>He starts to jog back to the house with the dog until he feels possessed by terror and sprints the final way. He races inside and locks the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.</narration></p>

    <p>Trevor’s mistake wasn’t durable, since nothing really went contrary to any of his longstanding expectations. His OK became so large so fast that there wasn't much time for the evaluations to balance and generate humor.</p>

<h2><outcome-contrast>Medium</outcome-contrast> duration of humor</h2><div class="h2">
    
        <div class="vignette">
        <p><narration>Lina gets an email that her college decision notification is ready. Her blood freezes. Heart pounding, she logs on to her account and clicks the ‘view decision update letter.’ Her mouth is dry while it loads.</narration></p>

    <p>
        Lina had spent a year investing thought and worry into a particular outcome, which strengthened her expectations. When she was accepted to the university, this went contrary to these durable expectations and generated a long duration of humor.

	<h2><outcome-contrast>Long</outcome-contrast> duration of humor</h2>
	<div class="h2"><div class="vignette">
	    <p>
	    <narration>Dr. Timothy Ailes participates in Doctors Without Borders, and spends six months assisting people displaced by violence. While he has comfortable lodging not far from the capital, seeing the degraded infrastructure, services, and environment continually shocks him.</narration>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    <narration>When he returns home to Washington, he’s shocked in reverse. As he lands in Tacoma and takes the train into Seattle, he’s speechless at the orderly housing and surplus of urban trees and efficient infrastructure with clean boundaries.</narration>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    <narration>For weeks, he finds himself laughing almost at random. It’s complex humor, giving a strange sense of unreality as he goes about his old routines in Seattle.</narration> <notes>(&larr;two weeks of <emotions-in-notes>humor</emotions-in-notes>)</notes>
	    </p>
	        </div>
	    <p>
	    Since Timothy had habituated to living in Seattle, he had developed durable expectations to those urban conditions. When he moved somewhere else, the different conditions went against his durable expectations. 
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    This created a long <term>mistake</term>, since it took him a long time to acclimate. But this long mistake <outcome-contrast>didn’t</outcome-contrast> generate long <em>humor</em>, since this mistake didn't constantly match with an OK. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    The same process happens in reverse when Timothy moves back to Seattle. He had by then developed new expectations around <term>Bangui</term>, which meant that it was now <em>Seattle</em> that deviates from those expectations.</p> 
	    
	    <p>This long mistake <sem-weak>does</sem-weak> generate long duration of humor, since the long mistake is seen as mostly OK.

	        alt="There are two evaluation graphs, one showing mistake and OK, the other showing the intensity of humor.

        <headline>Awareness.</headline> It's usually second nature to note the <term>intensity</term> of humor. <callback>("How much humor are they feeling?")</callback> But once it's pointed out, it quickly becomes second nature to note the <em>duration</em> of humor too. <callback>("How long are they feeling humor for?")</callback>
    </p>
    <p>
        Both dimensions of humor are important to notice, since both give us important information about their evaluations.

    A deeper look (Senses)

<div class="content-example">

<p>We usually think of our senses as things that let us be aware of <term>what</term> is around us. An interesting alternative perspective is that our senses let us be aware of what’s <em>changing</em> around us. Our senses are “difference noticers.” </p>

<p>This is why our eyes glide over familiar things, while immediately latching onto very small differences, like a:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>fork that’s out of place on the counter</li>
    <li>new grey hair</li>
    <li>frame that’s no longer level</li>
    <li>new behavior in the dog</li>
    <li>small scratch on our partner’s face</li>
    <li>single typo in a four-hundred-page book</li>    
    <li>new flower in our yard</li></ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>Our senses <term>de-emphasize</term> whatever <term>accords</term> with our expectations, while <em>emphasizing</em> things that <em>deviate</em> from those expectations. That means our senses prioritize our awareness of mistakes.</p>

  <img class="img-indent"
    src="../images/closer-look/cl-senses/cl-0-differencer-noticers.png"
    title=""
    alt=""
    style="max-width:24rem; margin-top: .5rem">



<p>The things that conform to our expectations accrue <vocab>perceptual camouflage</vocab>. Our attention slide off of things with perceptual camouflage. The more perceptual camouflage something has, the more effort it takes to evaluate something and to generate emotions from it.</p> 

<p>By screening out the things that have perceptual camouflage, we create a flat backdrop <callback>(“expectations”)</callback> that mistakes <callback>(“<outcome-contrast>deviations</outcome-contrast> from expectations”)</callback> pop out on.</p>


<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Perceptual camouflage is a bit like laying out a white tablecloth on the grass. This flat background makes it easy to see insects crawling across it. If we weren’t able to use a tablecloth, it would be much harder to notice insects on the grass.</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">By turning the expected things around us into a "tablecloth," anything that moves onto that tablecloth pops to attention.</p>
    </div>

<p>This is why the view from our new office may be intensely interesting to us at first&mdash;but over the course of a few weeks, the view stops generating emotions in us at all. When the view has fully accrued perceptual camouflage, we’re no longer noticing or evaluating the view.</p> 

<p>Sometimes, perceptual camouflage gets stripped. A guest may exclaim at the view from our office, which brings it back to our attention&mdash;or a building in the distance may catch on fire&mdash;and the smoke jumps out at us, making the view noticeable again</p>

<p>Similarly, if we move to a new house, we’ll notice every single creak and groan for a few weeks. But as those noises accrue perceptual camouflage, we stop registering any noises from the house at all. This de-emphasis of regular sounds creates a flat backdrop that lets even small noises to jump out at us—like how unexpected soft noises demand our attention, even as we no longer register the much louder cars, creaks, pipes, wind, and so on. </p>

<p>Sometimes, something happens that peels all the perceptual camouflage on something, like when we:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>use glasses for the first time <callback>(and everything seems clear)</callback></li>
    <li>have a first snowfall <callback>(and the landscape seem new)</callback></li>
    <li>watch high winds <callback>(and we’re mesmerized by how the trees move)</callback></li>
    <li>celebrate a festival <callback>(and decorations reenvigorated an old space)</callback></li>
    <li>visit a new city <callback>(and everything seems interesting)</callback></li>
    <li>get high <callback>(and everything becomes jewel-like)</callback></li>
    <li>attend a street protest <callback>(and the world seems different)</callback></li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on) </p>

<p>In these cases, since everything deviates from our expectations, <sem>everything</sem> is interesting to us! Normally, it takes effort to give attention to the branch outside our window—but after the first snowfall, the snowy branch <sem>attracts</sem> our attention.</p>

<p>We have vivid experiences whenever something strips most of our perceptual camouflage. Sometimes, these events are mistake-predominant experiences—like how driving through high winds can cause us attentive worry, and not humor.</p> 

<p>But often, these camouflage-stripping events generate broad feelings of humor—like when Yasmin gets glasses for the first time. We often describe these positive experiences as being alive, interesting, intense, joyful, or so on.</p> 

<p>This happens with our <term>external</term> senses <callback>(what we hear or see)</callback>—but it also happens with our <em>internal</em> senses too <callback>(what we think or feel)</callback>.</p> 

<p>When we get used to <sem>framing</sem> something a particular way, that framing accrues perceptual camouflage, just like something we look at all the time does. Eventually, we stop giving evaluatory attention to that framing:</p>

    <p><narration>After school one day, the text conversation crosses Zoe’s mind. It wasn’t such a big deal after all, was it? She gives a loud laugh, suddenly feeling cleansed.</narration> <notes>(&larr;a reframing from “big deal” to “not a big deal” strips perceptual camouflage)</notes></p>
    </div>


<div class="vignette">
   <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*getting ready*</action> <action>*thinking*</action> <speech>“I can’t believe I have to blow off Trevor just because Stephen and Tucker wants me to come into work this weekend. Tucker’s an entitled asshole, and Stephen thinks I’m like some kind of slave. God I hate this job, but I have to stick with it, because this is the only way I’ll ever be able to one day have a nice life. I have no choice!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;Yasmin is used to a framing of “trapped”)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>She stops to think about that.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Wow. Maybe I should look for a new job.”</speech></p>
    
    <p><narration>A weight falls off her, and she feels a clarity to things, and she laughs again.</narration> <notes>(&larr;a reframing from “trapped” to “not trapped” strips perceptual camouflage)</notes></p> </div>



<p>When we get used to framing something a particular way, this framing becomes expected and invisible. Since they fade into our expectations, they seem like just how the world is—and it becomes hard to give these framings attention. But new framings strip perceptual camouflage, making things seem new. </p>

<p>In the same way looking at something from a new <term>angle</term> <callback>(our house, our face, a tourist attraction)</callback> generates mistakes, looking at something from a new <em>framing</em> also generates mistakes.</p>

<p>All this helps us think about how emotions and senses connect to mistakes. Mistakes are nubs of non-regular information. Our senses highlight those nubs for us, which fast-tracks them for evaluation. These evaluations of mistakes make up our evaluatory state—our emotional state. Sometimes, these evaluations are expressed as humor.</p> 

<p>This gives us a brief initial look at the connection between expectations, senses, and humor—and the connection between humor and the positive removal of perceptual camouflage.</p>
