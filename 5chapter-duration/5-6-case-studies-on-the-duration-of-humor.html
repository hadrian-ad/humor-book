    Case studies on the duration of humor
</h1>
  <!-- 05.60 -->

<p>
	We can put everything together and think about why the duration of humor was as short or long as it was:
</p>

<h2>short duration of humor</h2>
<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Trevor is talking the dog out at night. As General Zod squats to pee, Trevor looks into the nearby patch of dark trees, and a deep fear comes over him.</narration></p>
	
<p><narration>He starts to jog back to the house with the dog until he feels possessed by terror and sprints the final way. He races inside and locks the door, and breathes a sigh of relief.</narration></p>

	<p><speech>“Phew. We made it, Zod. Safe!”</speech> <narration>He laughs as the dog wags its tail.</narration><notes> (&larr;two seconds of humor)</notes> <narration>Trevor goes about his business.</narration></p>
    </div>

<p class="indepth">Trevor’s mistake wasn’t durable. Nothing really went contrary to any of his durable expectations, and his OK quickly became so large that the mistake soon lost its ability to generate humor.
    </p>
<h2>medium duration of humor</h2>
	<div class="vignette">
	<p><narration>Lina gets an email that her college decision notification is ready. Her blood freezes. Heart pounding, she logs on to her account and clicks the ‘view decision update letter.’ Her mouth is dry while it loads.</narration></p>
	
	<p><speech>“Congratulations!”</speech> <narration>the letter says. Lina leaps up and pumps her fist.</narration> </p>
	
<p><speech>“Mom, mom!”</speech> <narration>she yells, thumping down the stairs.</narration> <speech>“I got into Pitt!”</speech> <narration>he jumps up and down and dances, glowing with happiness.</narration></p>
<p>
	<narration>As her mom congratulates her, she puts on a celebratory plastic tiara, feeling invincibly happy. They head out to get pizza, and she catches her reflection in the doors and laughs, and spends the rest of the evening joking with her mom.</narration> <notes>(&larr;two hours of humor)</notes>
    </p>

<p class="indepth">
	Lina had spent a year investing thought and worry into a particular outcome, which strengthened her expectations. When she was accepted to the university, this went contrary to her durable expectations and generated a long duration of humor. 
</p>
	<h2>long duration of humor</h2>
	<div class="vignette">
<p>
	<narration>Dr. Timothy Ailes participates in Doctors Without Borders, and spends six months assisting people displaced by violence. While he has comfortable lodging not far from the capital, seeing the degraded infrastructure, services, and environment continually shocks him.</narration>
</p>
<p>
	<narration>When he returns home to Washington, he’s shocked in reverse. As he lands in Tacoma and takes the train into Seattle, he’s speechless at the orderly housing and surplus of urban trees and efficient infrastructure with clean boundaries.</narration>
</p>
<p>
	<narration>For weeks, he finds himself laughing almost at random. It’s complex humor, giving a strange sense of unreality as he goes about his old routines in Seattle.</narration> <notes>(&larr;two weeks of humor)</notes>
</p>
    </div>
<p class="indepth">
	Timothy had strong expectations throughout this example. He had strongly habituated to conditions in Seattle, which was disrupted when he moved somewhere with different civil conditions for six months. 
</p>
<p class="indepth">
	This created a durable mistake, since it took him a long time to acclimate. But this durable mistake didn’t generate persisting <em> humor, </em> since this mistake doesn’t constantly match with an OK. 
</p>
<p class="indepth">
	The same process happens in reverse when Timothy moves back to Seattle. He had by then developed <em>new</em> durable expectations, which meant that now it was <term>Seattle</term> that deviates from those expectations. Since it takes a while to acclimate to those mistakes, he feels a long duration of humor—since the durable mistake is seen as mostly OK, even though it’s part of a complicated emotional state.

<p>
	It's usually second nature to note the intensity of humor. <callback>("How much humor are they feeling?")</callback> But once it's pointed out, it quickly becomes second nature to note the duration of humor as well. <callback>("How long are they feeling humor for?")</callback>
</p>
<p>
	Both dimensions of humor are important to notice, since both give us important information about the size and durability of their evaluations.

            Humor doesn't just have a magnitude, but a duration as well.

                The duration of humor is determined by the
                        duration that our <strong><a href="5-0-duration.html">evaluations are near to a 1 ratio
                    </a></strong>.

        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The size of our evaluations change at different rates based on how <strong>
                    <a href="5-1-mistakes-have-varying-longevity.html">
                        durable</a></strong> our expectations or sense of personal consequences are. The durability of our evaluations—their resistance to change—plays a role in the duration of humor.

                This model is about more than just humor—since it models <strong><a href="5-5-durable-mistakes-can-lead-to-long-grief-not-just-long-humor.html"> any emotion</a></strong>. Durable expectations can lead to long durations of grief or boredom the same way it can humor.
