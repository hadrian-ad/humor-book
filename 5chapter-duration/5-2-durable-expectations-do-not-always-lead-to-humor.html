Durable expectations don't always lead to humor 
</h1>
  
<p>
	The duration of a <term>mistake</term> isn't the same thing as the duration of <emotions>humor</emotions>. That's because humor only happens when the mistakes and OKs <em>balance</em>.
</p>
<p>
	It doesn't matter if it takes us a long or short time to acclimate to the mistake—without the mistake <em>also</em> being balanced with an OK, there won't be humor:

    style="max-width:27rem;">
<p>
	That means the duration of <em>humor</em> is controlled by how long a mistake and OK are in balance:

<p>
	When Justin telegraphs the joke, Heather can quickly acclimate to the coming mistake. Since she soon has a medium mistake and a large OK, she feels a short duration of humor.
</p>
<p>
	By contrast, Justin rarely makes speaking errors—which builds up durable expectations for Heather. Since her medium mistake and medium OK balance for a peried of time, she has a relatively longer duration of humor.
