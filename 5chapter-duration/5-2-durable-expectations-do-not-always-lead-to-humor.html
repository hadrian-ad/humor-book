Durable expectations don't always lead to humor 
</h1>
  
<p>
The duration of a mistake isn't the same thing as the duration of humor.
    </p> 
	
	<p>That's because humor only happens when the mistakes and OKs balance. So a long mistake won't generate long humor if it's not also balanced by an OK.</p>

	The duration of humor is controlled by how long a mistake and OK are balanced:

<p>
	When Justin telegraphs the joke, Heather quickly acclimates to the mistake. Since she soon has a medium mistake and a large OK, she feels a short duration of humor.
</p>
<p>
	By contrast, Justin rarely makes speaking errors—which builds up durable expectations for Heather. Since her medium mistake and medium OK balance for a peried of time, she has a relatively longer duration of humor.
