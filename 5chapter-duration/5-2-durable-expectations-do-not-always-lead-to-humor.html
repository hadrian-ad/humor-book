    <!--
<p>
	When Justin telegraphs the joke, Heather quickly acclimates to the mistake. Since she soon has a medium mistake and a large OK, she feels a short duration of humor.
</p>
<p>
	By contrast, Justin rarely makes speaking errors—which builds up durable expectations for Heather. Since her medium mistake and medium OK balance for a period of time, she has a relatively longer duration of humor.
