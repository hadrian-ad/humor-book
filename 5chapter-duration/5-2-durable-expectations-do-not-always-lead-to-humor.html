A long mistake doesn't mean long humor
</h1>
  
<p>
The <term>duration</term> of a <term>mistake</term> isn't the same thing as the <em>duration</em> of <em>humor</em>. That's because humor only happens when the mistakes and OKs <sem>balance</sem>.</p> 
        
<p>So a long mistake won't generate long humor unless it's also balanced by an OK:</p>

    style="max-width:27rem; margin-top:.5rem;">
<p>
	The duration of humor is controlled by how long a mistake and OK are balanced:

<p>
	When Justin telegraphs the joke, Heather quickly acclimates to the mistake. Since she soon has a medium mistake and a large OK, she feels a short duration of humor.
</p>
<p>
	By contrast, Justin rarely makes speaking errors—which builds up durable expectations for Heather. Since her medium mistake and medium OK balance for a period of time, she has a relatively longer duration of humor.
