	We experience long durations of mistake-predominant emotions all the time, like when:

<ul>
	<li class="indepth">
		a friend dies
	</li>
	<li class="indepth">
		a limb is lost

	<li class="indepth">

	<li class="indepth">

<p>The same process that prolongs our humor <callback>(things that go against integrated expectations)</callback> is what can prolong our anger or sadness as well.</p>

<p>Sometimes, this process can learn to long durations of humor:</p>

<p>
	When Justin telegraphs the joke, Heather quickly acclimates to the mistake. Since she soon has a medium mistake and a large OK, she feels a short duration of humor.
</p>
<p>
	By contrast, Justin rarely makes speaking errors—which builds up durable expectations for Heather. Since her medium mistake and medium OK balance for a period of time, she has a relatively longer duration of humor.
