<p>That's because when something <term>deviates</term> from our expectations, we immediately start <em>adjusting</em> our expectations. Eventually, our expectations completely readjust:</p>

<p><headline>Hourglasses.</headline> One component of "integrated" expectations is their durability. We can use an hourglass as a metaphor for this. When we start to form expectations, we flip over the hourglass and sand pours into the bottom.</p>
        
<p>The longer something behaves in ways we expect, the more sand we accumulate at the bottom of our hourglass. And the more sand on the bottom, the longer it takes to empty the bottom of our expectations when we flip the hourglass over again.</p>
        
<p>For instance, when Trevor makes a 69 joke, it’s like briefly flipping the hourglass over, and then flipping it over again—the mistake empties quickly:</p>

    alt="This diagram shows an hourglass being flipped briefly, then flipped again. Since the sand didn't have much time to accumulate at the bottom, things reset to normal quickly."
    style="max-width:28rem;">
	
	<p>
		By contrast, if Zoe and Emma look at a building every day for four years, they have a lot of time for sand to be added to their expectations. Once the building is torn down, it then takes a while for the sand to drain out:

    alt="This diagram shows an hourglass being flipped for a long time. Since the sand had a lot of time to accumulate at the bottom, it takes a while for a new normal to occur."
    style="max-width:28rem;">
	
<p>Once the sand has drained out, they’ve readjusted to a new normal, and they start adding sand to new expectations.</p>
