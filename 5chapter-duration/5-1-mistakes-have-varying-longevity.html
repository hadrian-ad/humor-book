Mistakes have varying longevity 
</h1>
 
<p>
	All mistakes shrink over time. At first, something <term>deviates</term> from our expectations—but we immediately start <em>acclimating</em> to that deviation. 
</p>
<p>
	Eventually, what was a deviation from our expectations turns <em>into</em> our expectations:

    <narration>Eventually, she starts to look normal to herself when she looks in the mirror.</narration> <notes>(&larr;Heather acclimates to mistake)</notes>

    <narration>A month later, Heather looks at an old post of her with her old hairstyle. She looked so different back then! </narration><notes>(&larr;Heather’s old mistake has become her expectations, and her old expectations have become a mistake)</notes>

<p>
	But while we always acclimate to mistakes, sometimes this happens quickly, and other times slowly:

</p>
    <p>The rate of acclimation depends on the <vocab>durability</vocab> of our expectations. Sometimes our expectations are <term>mallable</term>, and adjust quickly. Other times, our expectations are <em>durable</em>, and it takes us longer to adjust:</p>

		<p><headline>Hourglasses.</headline> We can use an hourglass as a metaphor for the durability of our expectations. When we start to form expectations, we flip over the hourglass and sand pours into the bottom.</p>
        
        <p>The longer something behaves in ways we expect, the more sand we accumulate at the bottom of our hourglass. The more sand on the bottom, the longer it takes to empty the bottom of our expectations when we flip the hourglass over again.</p>
        
        <p>For instance, when Trevor makes a 69 joke, it’s like briefly flipping the hourglass over, and then flipping it over again—the mistake empties quickly:</p>

	<p>
		By contrast, if Zoe and Emma look at a building every day for four years, they have a lot of time for sand to be added to their expectations. Once the building is torn down, it then takes a while for the sand to drain out:

<p>Once the sand has drained out, they’ve acclimated to a new normal, and they start adding sand to new expectations.</p>
