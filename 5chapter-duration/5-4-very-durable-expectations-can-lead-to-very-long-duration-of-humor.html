Very durable expectations can lead to very long duration of humor
</h1>

<p>
	Sometimes we feel humor not just for a few <term>seconds</term>—but for <em>hours</em> or <em>days</em>. This happens when when something deviates from particularly durable expectations:

<p>
	Eventually, we acclimate to even very durable expectations—and then the old expecations becomes our new mistakes. This is like how eventually <sem>not</sem> wearing glasses will be a mistake for Yasmin. 
</p>
<p>
	At that point, Yasmin will be more likely to feel humor if she <sem>doesn't</sem> put on her glasses than if she does.
</p>

    <div class="box">

		<p><headline>Fuel.</headline> Sometimes, it seems like <term>one</term> mistake generates a long duration of humor. When Yasmin puts on glasses for the first time, she’ll think of getting glasses as a single mistake that causes a lot of humor.</p>
	<p>
		Other times, it seems like <em>many</em> mistakes generate a long duration of humor. When Yasmin watches a comedian, she’ll think of the comedian's jokes and stories as many different mistakes that together cause a lot of humor. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We can use a metaphor with wood fuels to think about this. Durable expectations are like logs that burn for a long time <callback>(getting glasses)</callback>. If we don't have a method or opportunity to burn a big log for humor, we can use many smaller sticks instead <callback>(watching a comedian)</callback>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Comedy often feels like many sticks continually added to the fire—but that doesn't mean we <sem>always</sem> feel humor this way. Even though most comedians can't make the audience chuckle  for an hour after just a single joke, this often does  happen in our own lives—like when we get glasses, hear really good news, have good luck, and so on. In these cases, there's nothing surprising about laughing and smiling for ten minutes, an hour, or more.
