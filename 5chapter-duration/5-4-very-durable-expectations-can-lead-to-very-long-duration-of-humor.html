Some long mistakes lead to long humor
</h1>

<p>
	Sometimes we feel humor not just for a few seconds—but for hours or days. This happens when something deviates from particularly durable expectations:

    title="Humor that lasts for several days often involves a slow rate of acclimation"
    alt="A comparison of evaluation graphs demonstrates why something with a slow rate of acclimation, like getting glasses for the first time, may lead to long duration of humor"
    style="max-width:35rem; margin-top: 1rem;">

<p>
	Eventually, we acclimate to even very durable expectations—and then the old expectations becomes our new mistakes. This is like how eventually <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> wearing glasses will be a mistake for Yasmin. 
</p>
<p>
	At that point, Yasmin will be more likely to feel humor if she <outcome-contrast>doesn't</outcome-contrast> put on her glasses than if she does.
</p>

    <div class="box">

		<p><headline>Fuel.</headline> Sometimes, it seems like one mistake generates a long duration of humor. When Yasmin puts on glasses for the first time, she’ll think of getting glasses as a <term>single</term> mistake that causes a lot of humor.</p>
	<p>
		Other times, it seems like many mistakes generate a long duration of humor. When Yasmin watches a comedian, she’ll think of the comedian's jokes and stories as <em>many</em> different mistakes that together cause a lot of humor. 
	</p>
	<p>
		We can use a metaphor with wood fuels to think about this. Durable expectations are like logs that burn for a long time <callback>(getting glasses)</callback>. If we don't have a method or opportunity to burn a big log for humor, we can use many smaller sticks instead <callback>(hearing a comedic routine)</callback>.
	</p>
	<p>
	 Even though most comedians can't do one thing and make the audience chuckle for an hour afterward, this often does  happen in our own lives—like when we get glasses, hear really good news, have good luck, and so on.</p> 
	 
	 <p>In these cases, there's nothing surprising about laughing and smiling for ten minutes, an hour, or more&mdash;they're just things that deviate from our <sem-weak>durable</sem-weak> expectations.
