	We can describe and predict the duration of humor using the same ideas we looked at <a href="../4chapter-continuity/4-0-continuity.html">last chapter</a>: the duration of humor is however long the mistakes and OKs are close to matching in size:

	We’ll be looking at the duration of humor for the rest of this chapter.

     <p><headline>Emotions and durations.</headline> All emotions have a duration to them&mdash;like how grief or irritation can last for a split second, a minute, an hour, a day, a month, and so on.
		 </p>
<p>If we're sad all day, that doesn't mean we're sobbing for twenty hours straight. Instead, the intensity of sadness increases and decreases over the course of the day—and <sem-weak>if</sem-weak> it crests into crying, it'll eventually pull back and continue at a lower intensity.</p>

<p>It’s the same for humor. When we feel humor all day, that doesn't mean we're laughing non-stop for twenty hours straight. Instead, the intensity of humor increases and decreases over the course of the day—and <sem-weak>if</sem-weak> it crests into laughing, it'll eventually pull back and continue at a lower intensity:</p>

	    <p>
	    Any peak of humor will be bookended by less intense humor. To think about the duration of humor, we'll have pay close attention to the bookending moments of humor peaks.
