Witty banter is surreal
</h1>

<p>We don't always notice that witty banter is surreal&mdash;but it is!</p>

<p>Like an action scene, this comedic scene is emotionally, practically, and situationally surreal.</p>

<ul>
   <li>The scene is <strong>emotionally</strong> surreal. No one reacts normally. It would be surreal for Emma, Zoe, and Owen to somehow have an impromptu conversation like this in a field and not show any amazement, amusement, reflection, self-reference, or so on.</li>
   
    <li>The scene is <strong>practically</strong> surreal. Emma, Zoe, and Owen can’t have this kind of prolonged, rhythmic, and spontaneous wit, any more than they can have prolonged, rhythmic, and spontaneous sword fights. It’s just not something people can suddenly do.</li> 
    
    <li>The scene is <strong>situationally</strong> surreal. They’re collecting rocks from tall grass without gloves, work clothes, wheelbarrows, and so on.</li> 
    </ul>
    
<p>We can <term>produce</term> this scene with effort, but it won't <em>happen</em> in our lives like this. </p>
    
    <p>In the same way extended fist fights don’t actually happen in the world, extended witty repartee doesn’t happen either. These things are surreal!</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">In real life, there <sem>are</sem> witty conversations, and there <sem>are</sem> fist fights&mdash;but they’re <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> extended, rhythmic, unhesitating, and crystal clear to spectators, like they can be in some spectator entertainment. </p>
   
    
<p class="considertext">Once it’s pointed out, it’s obvious that scripted, practiced, stylized, witty conversations <sem>aren't</sem> straightforward mirrors to the witty conversations that happen in real life.</p>
 </div>
 
<div class="box">
   
    <p><headline>Evolution.</headline> Since spectator entertainment prioritizes the evaluations of spectators, there's an evolution of everything in it to orient around us&mdash;everything from the character design to the camera angles to the sets evolve toward our evaluations.</p> 
   
   <p>In some ways, we can think of a lot of spectator entertainment as a kind of yes man&mdash;someone who is trying to get into our good graces even at the cost of relevance to reality.</p>
   
    <p>Some things don't evolve for spectators, but for participants&mdash;while the design of Disney World evolves for spectators, that's not always the case of residential streets, which evolves for all users. These differing priorities make them evolve differently.</p>
