The presence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>Sometimes the <term>absence</term> of humor is surreal&mdash;but other times the <em>presence</em> of humor is surreal.</p> 
    
    <p>We often notice this in advertisements or corporate videos:</p> 

    <img src="../images/13c-images-surreal/13-03-presence-surreal/13-3-0-multiple-graphs.png"

title="Smiling advertisements"
alt="There are three images of advertisements. 1) an airline steward smiles broadly, 2) a woman spays chemical fragrance while smiling heroically, 3) an illustration of a woman in an old poster advertisemt smiles with wonder as she examines a can of food."
style="max-width: 40rem; margin-left: "

<p>The smile made by the airline steward is surreal&mdash;it’s uncomfortable to show teeth for very long and to not adjust our smiles. It’s not something people do in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
<p class="considertext">The humor in spectator entertainment sometimes becomes so familiar that we no longer notice the humor tells as surreal. It's not until we stop to pay attention that we realize how odd it all is&mdash;like how our friends would be concerned if we expressed humor the way it often is in advertisements.
            </p>    

    </div>

<p>Similarly, we can spot surrealness in the advertisement below by asking: <callback>“who is the women in the sewing machine advertisement smiling at?”</callback> The answer is simultaneously no one and everyone&mdash;it’s surreal!</p>

alt="An old advertisement in Japanese shows a woman at a new fancy home sewing machine making eye-contact and smiling at us. An annotation asks 'who is the woman smiling at?'"
style="max-width: ; margin-left: "

<p>Emotional surrealism is often enjoyable or effective&mdash;there’s nothing inherently wrong or right about it. But it <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> become a problem if we start thinking that emotionally surreal things reflect the world more straightforwardly than they really do.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">Many of us have seen more apartments and homes in TV shows and movies than we've been in in real life. That menas these surreal apartments can start bleeding into how we think apartments actually are.</p>

    <p class="considertext">Similarly,  if we watch hundreds of actors and characters &mdash;in advertisements, podcasts, video essays, movies, cartoons, books, and so on&mdash;these surreal people can also start bleeding into how we think people actually act.</p>
                  
    <p class="considertext">By being able to thoughtfully track what's surreal and what isn't, we can better avoid the distorted thinking that can happen from focusing on invented or performed things.

    <p>There are many surreal elements to this advertisement&mdash;like at the end, when the actor takes a distant sniff of her shoes while pretending to hold a camera or phone, with the editors adding a sound effect (a sigh of delight). Then the actor looks at the camera she's pretending to hold, and smiles. The editors add in a giggle as a sound effect. </p>
