The presence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>Sometimes the <term>absence</term> of humor is surreal&mdash;but other times the <em>presence</em> of humor is surreal.</p> 
    
    <p>This is often most noticeable in advertisements or corporate videos:</p> 

    <img src="../images/11c-images-spectator-humor-profiles/11-09-presence-surreal/11-9-0-multiple-graphs.png"

title="Smiling advertisements"
alt="There are three images of advertisements. 1) an airline steward smiles broadly, 2) a woman spays chemical fragrance while smiling heroically, 3) an illustration of a woman in an old poster advertisemt smiles with wonder as she examines a can of food."
style="max-width: 40rem; margin-left: "

<p>The smile made by the airline steward is surreal—it’s uncomfortable to show teeth for very long and to not adjust our smiles. It’s not something people do in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
<p class="considertext">The spectator humor profiles in advertisements are so familiar that we often no longer notice them as unrealistic. It's not until we stop to pay attention that we realize how odd they are&mdash;like that our friends would be concerned if we expressed humor how the characters in advertisements often do.
            </p>    

    </div>

<p>Similarly, we can spot surrealness in the advertisement below by asking: <i>“who is the women in the sewing machine advertisement smiling at?” </i>The answer is simultaneously no one and everyone—it’s surreal!</p>

title="Smiling advertisements"
alt="An old advertisement in Japanese shows a woman at a new fancy home sewing machine making eye-contact and smiling at us. An annotation asks 'who is the woman smiling at?'"
style="max-width: ; margin-left: "

<p>Emotional surrealism is often enjoyable or effective—there’s nothing inherently wrong or right about it. But it can become a problem if we start thinking that emotionally surreal things reflect the world more straightforwardly than they really do.</p>

    <p>There are many surreal elements to this advertisement—like at the end, when the actor takes a distant sniff of her shoes while pretending to hold a camera or phone, with the editors adding a sound effect (a sigh of delight). Then the actor looks at the camera she's pretending to hold, and smiles. The editors add in a giggle as a sound effect. </p>

<div class="content-example">

  <p>Spectator entertainment is often commercialized&mdash;which means that there's a priority for maximizing money somewhere in the production chain. Commercialization gives things design priorities that shape how they turn out.</p> 

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to hotels, since commercialization shapes how hotels are built. For instance, architects are told that the hotel rooms should:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>be easy to clean</li>
    <li>be durable</li>
    <li>be inoffensive</li>
    <li>have an orderly and efficient arrangement</li>
    <li>not be more expensively furnished then necessary</li>
    <li>reduce theft</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This helps us understand part of why hotel rooms look like hotel rooms, and not like someone’s bedroom. In our bedroom, we can put whatever art we like on the walls&mdash;since we're not worried someone will steal it or give them a bad review, like we might if decorating a hotel.</p> 

<p>Something similar happens to when humor is a goal of something commercialized. The commercialization gives design priorities to things like movies or comedians, where the creators may then try to:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>appeal to a broad audience</li>
    <li>be a conventional length</li>
    <li>be accessible to many people</li>
    <li>be reproducible</li>
    <li>fit an advertising model</li>
    <li>not allow disruptive interaction from the audience</li>
    <li>represent the distributor or host</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>This explains in part why a funny clip from a <term>comedy</term> and a funny video from our <em>partner</em> aren't similar. In part, that’s because our partner isn’t shaped by any commercial priorities!</p> 

<p>Our partner can focus entirely on us alone, without worrying about whether they'll also appeal to a broad audience or if they'll fit with an advertising model. It's similar to how a residential bedroom can look different than a hotel bedroom&mdash;the goals and priorities are different.</p> 

<p>Our partner can also activate topics specific to just us, in a way a video designed for hundreds of thousands of people can't.</p>


<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If a movie is trying to reach tens of millions of people, it has design priorities that will screen out niche content.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We won’t see a blockbuster <term>movie</term> that makes a joke about a restaurant in our hometown&mdash;let alone about a gift we once got during a birthday dinner there.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">However, our <em>partner</em> may activate these topics&mdash;which is one reason people can provide things in conversation that we can't get from things with more commercialized design priorities.</p> 
</div>

<p>We’re often aware of the upsides and downsides of <vocab>scaling</vocab>, like for rented rooms. We intuitively know this when thinking about staying in a Bed &amp; Breakfast with three rooms or a resort with 1,000 rooms.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">The resort may have efficiencies of scale, so their 1,000 rooms can support a water park and commercial kitchens&mdash;while a three-room bed and breakfast can’t.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">At the same time, the resort will be unable to have an entrance that's cozy, delicate, detailed, distinctive, small, textured, unique, and so on&mdash;since there's just too many people coming in and out!</p> </div>

<p>But even though we're used to thinking this way for things like <term>hotels</term>, we sometimes aren't used to thinking this way for <em>spectator entertainment</em>&mdash;which is often similar.</p> 
 
 
 <p>A comedic movie for ten million people is very different then a small open mic night for ten listeners&mdash;which is itself different than a conversation with our partner.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
     <p class="considertext">We may wonder why people may go to local comedy open mics. There are many reasons&mdash;one of which is that we can get local references or characteristics in ways we simply can't from other spectator entertainment!</p>
     </div>
 <p>The point here isn't to say that commercialization or scalability is bad, since it's not&mdash;those things can be good or bad. Instead, the point is to notice the reasons that spectater entertainment is the way it is. This lets us be thoughtful about how these things relate to our day-to-day lives.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We may enjoy going to a hotel for a vacation. But it wouldn't make sense to think that because we enjoyed it hotel rooms are how <sem>all</sem> bedrooms everywhere should be.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">It's the same for comedic books or movies. We may enjoy them&mdash;but at the same time, it's not something that defines how all moments of humor should be everywhere.</p>

    A spectator humor profile is designed to harmonize with a specific medium so its performable for creators and engaging to spectators.

<p>Surreal things create medium-specific humor patterns due to their constraints in presenting humor. These various humor patterns are "spectator humor profiles," which allow those mediums to convey evaluatory information.</p>

<ul>
   <li>When we become familiar with different <a href="11-00-spectator-humor-profiles.html">spectator humor profiles</a>, they start seeming normal&mdash;but normal is different than "real." These spectator humor profiles aren't perfect mirrors of our lives&mdash;they're surreal.
   </li> 
   
   <li>Spectator entertainment often takes advantage of <a href="11-07-spectators-and-spectator-characters-are-usually-desynchronized.html">desynchronized evaluations</a>&mdash;the characters feel one thing while the spectators feel another. This gap allows for divergent situations and evaluations, like us laughing when they (a character) gets hit by a bus.</li> 
    
    <li>Both the <a href="11-08-the-absence-of-humor-can-be-surreal.html">absence and the presence</a> of humor in spectator entertainment can be surreal. The humor doesn't always occur where it would in real life, and sometimes occurs where it wouldn't.</li>
