The presence of humor can be surreal
</h1>


<p>Sometimes the <term>absence</term> of humor is surreal&mdash;but other times the <em>presence</em> of humor is surreal.</p> 
    
    <p>We often notice this in advertisements or corporate videos:</p> 

    <img src="../images/13c-images-surreal/13-03-presence-surreal/13-3-0-multiple-graphs.png"

title="Smiling advertisements"
alt="There are three images of advertisements. 1) an airline steward smiles broadly, 2) a woman spays chemical fragrance while smiling heroically, 3) an illustration of a woman in an old poster advertisemt smiles with wonder as she examines a can of food."
style="max-width: 40rem; margin-left: "
>



<p>The smile made by the airline steward is surreal&mdash;it’s uncomfortable to show teeth for very long and to not adjust our smiles. It’s not something people do in day-to-day interactions.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
       
<p class="considertext">The humor in spectator entertainment sometimes becomes so familiar that we no longer notice the humor tells as surreal. It's not until we stop to pay attention that we realize how odd it all is&mdash;like how our friends would be concerned if we expressed humor the way it often is in advertisements.
            </p>    

    </div>

<p>Similarly, we can spot surrealness in the advertisement below by asking: <callback>“who is the women in the sewing machine advertisement smiling at?”</callback> The answer is simultaneously no one and everyone&mdash;it’s surreal!</p>

alt="An old advertisement in Japanese shows a woman at a new fancy home sewing machine making eye-contact and smiling at us. An annotation asks 'who is the woman smiling at?'"
style="max-width: ; margin-left: "

<p>Emotional surrealism is often enjoyable or effective&mdash;there’s nothing inherently wrong or right about it. But it <sem-weak>can</sem-weak> become a problem if we start thinking that emotionally surreal things reflect the world more straightforwardly than they really do.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">If we've seen more apartments in TV shows and movies than we have in real life&mdash;these surreal apartments can start bleeding into how we think apartments actually are.</p>

    <p class="considertext">Similarly,  if we watch hundreds of actors and characters &mdash;in advertisements, podcasts, video essays, movies, cartoons, books, and so on&mdash;these surreal people can also start bleeding into how we think people actually act.</p>
                  
    <p class="considertext">By being able to thoughtfully track what's surreal and what isn't, we can better avoid the distorted thinking that can happen from focusing on invented or performed things.

       <p><headline>Illusions.</headline>     
            While the word illusion today has connatation with magic, mystery, deception, optical tricks, and so on&mdash;the etymology of illusion comes from a word that means "in play." <callback>(Illudere.)</callback></p>
         
        <p>So when childern arrange dolls and have them go about their doll lives, there's an illusion involving the children and dolls. Or, in this chapter, there's an illusion between us and the TV actors.</p>
                     
        <p>It's not illusions that are bad themselves&mdash;since they're not. Instead, it can be bad when we're caught unaware by them&mdash;the feeling of disillusionment.</p> 
        
        <p>One of the challenges when thinking about humor is the often the overwhelming intrusion of these illusions, which become flattened to unremarkable by our familiarity with them.</p> 
        
        <p>This can slant our thinking in ways that&mdash;if we're not careful&mdash;can make interacting with people around us harder than it has to be.</p>
        
        
       <!--
       <p>We've been using the word "surreal" as being familiar and good enough. But it's not a very clear word. In this book, something is as "surreal" as the effort needed to create and sustain it.</p>
       
       <p>A play is surreal for not being spontaneous&mdash;a lot of effort goes into the two hours of a play. and an emergency would have it dissipate immediately.</p>

    A deeper look (Money)

<div class="content-example">

  <p>Spectator entertainment is often commercialized&mdash;which means that there's a priority for maximizing money somewhere in the production chain. Commercialization gives things design priorities that shape how they turn out.</p> 

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to hotels, since commercialization shapes how hotels are built. For instance, architects are told that the hotel rooms should:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>be easy to clean</li>
    <li>be durable</li>
    <li>be inoffensive</li>
    <li>have an orderly and efficient arrangement</li>
    <li>not be more expensively furnished then necessary</li>
    <li>reduce theft</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This helps us understand part of why hotel rooms look like hotel rooms, and not like someone’s bedroom. In our bedroom, we can put whatever art we like on the walls&mdash;since we're not worried someone will steal it or give them a bad review, like we might if decorating a hotel.</p> 

<p>Something similar happens to when humor is a goal of something commercialized. The commercialization gives design priorities to things like movies or comedians, where the creators may then try to:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>appeal to a broad audience</li>
    <li>be a conventional length</li>
    <li>be accessible to many people</li>
    <li>be reproducible</li>
    <li>fit an advertising model</li>
    <li>not allow disruptive interaction from the audience</li>
    <li>represent the distributor or host</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>This explains in part why a funny clip from a <term>comedy</term> and a funny video from our <em>partner</em> aren't similar. In part, that’s because our partner isn’t shaped by any commercial priorities!</p> 

<p>Our partner can focus entirely on us alone, without worrying about whether they'll also appeal to a broad audience or if they'll fit with an advertising model. It's similar to how a residential bedroom can look different than a hotel bedroom&mdash;the goals and priorities are different.</p> 

<p>Our partner can also activate topics specific to just us, in a way a video designed for hundreds of thousands of people can't.</p>


<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If a movie is trying to reach tens of millions of people, it has design priorities that will screen out niche content.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We won’t see a blockbuster <term>movie</term> that makes a joke about a restaurant in our hometown&mdash;let alone about a gift we once got during a birthday dinner there.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">However, our <em>partner</em> may activate these topics&mdash;which is one reason people can provide things in conversation that we can't get from things with more commercialized design priorities.</p> 
</div>

<p>We’re often aware of the upsides and downsides of <vocab>scaling</vocab>, like for rented rooms. We intuitively know this when thinking about staying in a three-room Bed &amp; Breakfast or a 1,000 room resort.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">The resort may have efficiencies of scale, so their 1,000 rooms can support a water park and commercial kitchens&mdash;while a three-room bed and breakfast can’t.</p> 
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">At the same time, the resort will be unable to have an entrance that's cozy, delicate, detailed, distinctive, small, textured, unique, and so on&mdash;since there's just too many people coming in and out!</p> </div>

<p>But even though we're used to thinking this way for things like <term>hotels</term>, we sometimes aren't used to thinking this way for <em>spectator entertainment</em>&mdash;which is often similar.</p> 
 
 
 <p>A comedic movie for ten million people is very different then a small open mic night for ten listeners&mdash;which is itself different than a conversation with our partner.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
     <p class="considertext">We may wonder why people may go to local comedy open mics. There are many reasons&mdash;one of which is that we can get local references or characteristics in ways we simply can't from other spectator entertainment!</p>
     </div>
 <p>The point here isn't to say that commercialization or scalability is bad, since it's not&mdash;those things can be good or bad. Instead, the point is to notice the <sem-weak>reasons</sem-weak> that spectater entertainment is the way it is&mdash;and to notice what isn't in spectator entertainment.</p> 
 
 <p>This lets us be thoughtful about how these things relate to our day-to-day lives.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">We may enjoy going to a hotel for a vacation. But just because we enjoyed it doesn't mean hotel rooms are how <sem>all</sem> bedrooms everywhere should be.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">It's the same for comedic books or movies. We may enjoy them&mdash;but at the same time, it's not something that defines how <sem>all</sem> moments of humor should be everywhere.</p>
