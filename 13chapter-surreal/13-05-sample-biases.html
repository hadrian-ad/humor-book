Accurately sampling humor
</h2>

     <p>For many of us, when we hear the word "humor" we think of surreal things&mdash;like jokes, memes, satires, comedies, comedians, and so on.</p>  

<p>While these things can be fun and wonderful&mdash;we also don't want to have a <em>bias</em> toward those things. If those were the only things we looked at, our understanding of humor lopsided.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <aside class="consider"><!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>-->
        
        <p>If we wanted to study warfare, we would lose our grounding if we <em>only</em> studied movies set in wartime.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, if we wanted to study smiling and laughing, we would also lose our grounding if we <em>only</em> studied our favorite comedies.</p> </aside></div>

<p>Where do we <em>actually</em> smile and laugh in the world, outside of spectator entertainment? Until it's pointed out, we often don't notice all the places we do:</p>

<p>Above, we can see people laughing and smiling in a way that arise out of day-to-day situations&mdash;in ways that aren't always clearly represented in surreal spectator entertainment.</p>

<p>By being able to see and think about humor as it happens spontaneously, we'll gain access to improving at a variety of skills that require a spontaneous touch, like:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>connecting with strangers</li>
    <li>delighting our partner</li>
    <li>leading a group</li>
    <li>supporting a struggling friend</li>
    <li>defusing an argument</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p>

<p>To understand these moments well, we have to be able to set aside spectator humor to be able to see the situation with clear reality.</p>
   
<div class="consider">
     <aside class="consider">
         <p>  We know that <term>reading</term> about a feast isn't the same thing as <term2>being</term2> at a feast. Similarly, reading about a terrible event isn't the same thing as living thorugh that terrible event.</p>
                    
             <p>For the same reason, <term>watching</term> a witty conversation isn't the same thing as <term2>participating</term2> in a witty conversation&mdash;just like watching someone delight their partner isn't the same thing as delighting our partner.</p> 
                                
                    
             <p>We can't compare ourselves to&mdash;or straightforwardly learn from&mdash;surreal standards. Being able to compare apples to oranges correctly here matters in reaching a high competence in assessment and ability. </p>

    <p><headline>Play.</headline> The word illusion is an interesting one&mdash;and today has connotations with magic, mystery, deception, tricks, and so on. Of course, the etymology of the word gives a clearer picture&mdash;illusion came from a word that means "in play."</p>
      
        <p>So football players have their illusion thorugh their game&mdash;children arranging dolls are composing an illusion&mdash;we pretend or daydream about being someone else through illusion. We're in play.</p>
                  
        <p>It's not that illusions that are bad themselves&mdash;since they're not. Instead, it can be bad when we're caught unaware by them. Then we risk the feeling of disillusionment&mdash;the sense of being expelled from a game we didn't know we were part of.</p> 
     
        <p>Even if we're not disillusioned, when we don't quite realize what's <em>pretended</em> coherence and what isn't&mdash;our thinking can become slanted in ways that make interacting with others harder than it has to be.</p>

<p>We've been using the word "surreal" as being familiar and good enough. But it's not a very clear word. In this book, something is as "surreal" as the effort needed to create and sustain it.</p>

<p>A play is surreal for not being spontaneous&mdash;a lot of effort goes into the two hours of a play. and an emergency would have it dissipate immediately.</p>

    A deeper look (Money)
    
    </button>
     
<div class="content-example">

  <p>Spectator entertainment is often commercialized&mdash;which means that there's a priority for maximizing money somewhere in the production chain. Commercialization gives things design priorities that shape how they turn out.</p> 

<p>We can understand this with an analogy to hotels, since commercialization shapes how hotels are built. For instance, architects are told that the hotel rooms should:</p> 

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>be easy to clean</li>
    <li>be durable</li>
    <li>be inoffensive</li>
    <li>have an orderly and efficient arrangement</li>
    <li>not be more expensively furnished then necessary</li>
    <li>reduce theft</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>This helps us understand part of why hotel rooms look like hotel rooms, and not like someone’s bedroom. In our bedroom, we can put whatever art we like on the walls&mdash;since we're not worried someone will steal it or give them a bad review, like we might if decorating a hotel.</p> 

<p>Something similar happens to when humor is a goal of something commercialized. The commercialization gives design priorities to things like movies or comedians, where the creators may then try to:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>appeal to a broad audience</li>
    <li>be a conventional length</li>
    <li>be accessible to many people</li>
    <li>be reproducible</li>
    <li>fit an advertising model</li>
    <li>not allow disruptive interaction from the audience</li>
    <li>represent the distributor or host</li>
    </ul>

<p class="and-so-on">(or so on)</p> 

<p>This explains in part why a funny clip from a <term>comedy</term> and a funny video from our <term2>partner</term2> aren't similar. In part, that’s because our partner isn’t shaped by any commercial priorities!</p> 

<p>Our partner can focus entirely on us alone, without worrying about whether they'll also appeal to a broad audience or if they'll fit with an advertising model. It's similar to how a residential bedroom can look different than a hotel bedroom&mdash;the goals and priorities are different.</p> 

<p>Our partner can also activate topics specific to just us, in a way a video designed for hundreds of thousands of people can't.</p>


<div class="for-instance">
    <aside class="consider"><!--<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>-->
        
        <p>If a movie is trying to reach tens of millions of people, it has design priorities that will screen out niche content.</p> 
        
        <p>We won’t see a blockbuster <term>movie</term> that makes a joke about a restaurant in our hometown&mdash;let alone about a gift we once got during a birthday dinner there.</p>
        
        <p>However, our <term2>partner</term2> may activate these topics&mdash;which is one reason people can provide things in conversation that we can't get from things with more commercialized design priorities.</p> </aside>
</div>

<p>We’re often aware of the upsides and downsides of <vocab>scaling</vocab>, like for rented rooms. We intuitively know this when thinking about staying in a three-room Bed &amp; Breakfast or a 1,000 room resort.</p>

<div class="for-instance">
   <aside class="consider"><!--<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>-->
        
        <p>The resort may have efficiencies of scale, so their 1,000 rooms can support a water park and commercial kitchens&mdash;while a three-room bed and breakfast can’t.</p> 
        
        <p>At the same time, the resort will be unable to have an entrance that's cozy, delicate, detailed, distinctive, small, textured, unique, and so on&mdash;since there's just too many people coming in and out!</p> </aside></div>

<p>But even though we're used to thinking this way for things like <term>hotels</term>, we sometimes aren't used to thinking this way for <term2>spectator entertainment</term2>&mdash;which is often similar.</p> 
 
 
 <p>A comedic movie for ten million people is very different then a small open mic night for ten listeners&mdash;which is itself different than a conversation with our partner.</p>

<div class="consider">
    <aside class="consider">
        <!--<p class="consider">Consider:</p>--> 
         <p>We may wonder why people may go to local comedy open mics. There are many reasons&mdash;one of which is that we can get local references or characteristics in ways we simply can't from other spectator entertainment!</p>
    </aside>
     </div>
 <p>The point here isn't to say that commercialization or scalability is bad, since it's not&mdash;those things can be good or bad. Instead, the point is to notice the <sem-weak>reasons</sem-weak> that spectator entertainment is the way it is&mdash;and to notice what isn't in spectator entertainment.</p> 
 
 <p>This lets us be thoughtful about how these things relate to our day-to-day lives.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <aside class="consider">
        <!--<p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>-->
        
        <p>We may enjoy going to a hotel for a vacation. But just because we enjoyed it doesn't mean hotel rooms are how <em>all</em> bedrooms everywhere should be.</p>
        
        <p>It's the same for comedic books or movies. We may enjoy them&mdash;but at the same time, it's not something that defines how <em>all</em> moments of humor should be everywhere.</p>
