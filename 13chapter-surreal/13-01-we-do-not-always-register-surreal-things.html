We acclimate to surreal things
</h1>

<p>We sometimes get so familiar to surreal things that we don’t even register them as they’re surreal. This is like how <sem-weak>editing</sem-weak> is surreal, even though we sometimes stop noticing it's there:</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Trevor and Yasmin are watching <book-title>Fired Fireman 2</book-title></narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>The lieutenant and Chief are arguing about the secret identity of the Arsonist King as they walk down a hallway in the police station. The scene cuts to them in the lieutenant's car, but their dialogue continues unbroken from where it was in the hallway.</narration></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Yasmin:</speaker> <speech>“I love how the movie just cuts as if they paused their conversation for ten minutes while they got into the car!"</speech> <notes>(&larr;the scene treats time and space surreally by continuing same conversation in different places)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Trevor:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“I never noticed that before!" </speech> <notes>(&larr;Trevor has lost track of the surreal elements of spectator entertainment)</notes></p> </div>

<p>No one has ever had a conversation like Chief and the lieutenant, where causality, space, and time warp to allow a conversation to continue unbroken. It’s surreal!</p> 

<p>There’s nothing wrong with this surrealness, since the movie’s goal is to generate humor&mdash;not be realistic for realism’s sake.</p> 

<p>At the same time, it would be wrong to lose track that these comedies <sem>are</sem> surreal. That would give us a distorted understanding of how the world is actually working around us.</p>


<div class="for-instance">
   <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
    
<p class="for-instance-text">If police took grappling cues from professional wrestling matches, they’d be taking spectator entertainment as a template for how to interpersonally interact with others&mdash;a disturbing error.</p>
    
    <p class="for-instance-text">If we watched a musical and thought people were <i>supposed</i> to be able to make a train car full of strangers spontaneously dance, we’d be comparing ourselves to a surreal standard.</p>
        
    <p class="for-instance-text">In the same way, if we watch a <sem>comedy</sem> with amazing extended repartee and think it’s a template for how we should interacting with others&mdash;we also end up in disharmony with how humor and the world works around us.</p>
    </div>

   

   <div class="box">

<p><headline>Seeing surrealness</headline>. With practice, we can see how spectator entertainment is surreal. For instance, we can imagine:</p>

<ul class="close-list">
   <li>sitcoms with the laugh track removed&mdash;and notice how the cadence of conversation is surreal without it.</li>
    <li>transcripts of a hilarious night with family or friends&mdash;and notice how the transcription doesn’t at all mimic the script of a comedic scene</li>
    <li>screenplays that took months to write and tune&mdash;and notice that movie characters pretend to do all that extemporaneously during conversation</li>
    <li>comedies with the editing removed, and being just a single camera following a single person&mdash;and notice how that changes the flow of the film</li>
    <li>scenes where a character doesn’t notice someone is obviously hiding something behind their back&mdash;and notice that this isn’t how people would usually behave</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="and-so-on">(and so on)</p> 

<p>The goal isn't to see this surrealness as "bad"&mdash;the goal is simply to see surrealness <sem-weak>as</sem-weak> surrealness. This lets us avoid seeing surreal things as straightforwardly mirrors of life.</p>
