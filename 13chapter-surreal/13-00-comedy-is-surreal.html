<p class="overtitle">Surreal</p>
</div>

<body>

<p>In this chapter, we'll look at how spectator entertainment is <vocab>surreal</vocab>. 

<p>It's obvious that fight scenes are surreal:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen and Emma are watching the trailer for <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title>.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>The hero, Rage Man, guns down dozens of henchmen while they ineffectively return fire. Then a missile explodes near him, throwing Rage Man against a concrete wall&mdash;but he gets up in time to behead a charging henchmen with a keyboard.</narration> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“You know, I hear your body just liquidates if you’re close enough to be blasted off your feet by an explosion.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Yeah, but the dude’s not even wearing earplugs, so he’s clearly made of sterner stuff!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(thoughtfully)</internalaction> <speech>“Do you think you could really decapitate someone with a keyboard?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>          
    </div>

<p>Emma and Owen know this is surreal&mdash;they don't go around thinking that they could elegantly decapitate henchmen with keyboards.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">It doesn't matter to Emma and Owen that <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title> is surreal&mdash;because they aren't looking for realism for realism’s sake.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">They want the movie to <term>entertain</term> them&mdash;not to <em>teach</em> them how to fight with keyboards.</p>
    </div>

<p>But while it’s often obvious to us that <term>action</term> scenes are surreal, we don’t always think of <em>comedy</em> scenes as being equally surreal&mdash;but they are!</p>


<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sam watches <book-title>Fired Fireman 3</book-title> on his laptop.</narration></p> 
   
   <p><narration>Chief is trying to get the household ready for school, but he’s comically inept at it. As he runs to get the doorbell, he slips on a toy car left on the stairs.</narration></p>
   
    <p><narration>Chief rolls down three flights of stairs, but gets up and shakes it off.</narration> <notes>(&larr;character is immune to harm)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="vig-or-indent">- OR -</p>
    
    <p><narration>Sam watches Jennifer slip on a toy car left on the stairs.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>Jennifer is bruised, sore, and frightened for the rest of the day.</narration> <notes>(&larr;scene from movie was surreal, which is why Jennifer was hurt when chief wasn't)</notes></p>
    
    </div>
<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Sam and Jennifer are performing a play. In the audience, Justin and Heather are enjoying themselves.</narration></p>  
   
   <p><narration>Sam jumps on the table and smoothly props his head up, just like he's practiced hundreds of times. The audience laughs.</narration></p>
   
    <p><narration>The audience doesn't know how much trouble the prop team had in getting a table that was sturdy and low enough for Sam. This was one of the hardest scenes to do in the entire play!</narration> <notes>(&larr;Sam has the right props and practice to lay across the table in a play)</notes></p>
    
    <p class="or">- LATER -</p>
    
    <p><narration>While eating breakfast the next morning, Justin decides to get on the table to make Jennifer laugh&mdash;but Heather's table shakes ominously as he awkward clambers on. He barely avoids knocking off a plate, and he doesn't fit on the table like he thought.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>Heather is shocked, bewildered, and concerned.</narration> <notes>(&larr;scene from a comedy is surreal, which is why it can't be straightforwardly imitated in real life)</notes></p>

<p>Like the action scene, this comedic scene is emotionally, practically, and situationally surreal.</p>

<ul>
   <li>The scene is <strong>emotionally</strong> surreal. No one reacts normally. It would be surreal for Emma, Zoe, and Owen to somehow have an impromptu conversation like this in a field and not show any amazement, amusement, reflection, self-reference, or so on.</li>
   
    <li>The scene is <strong>practically</strong> surreal. Emma, Zoe, and Owen can’t have this kind of prolonged, rhythmic, and spontaneous wit, any more than they can have prolonged, rhythmic, and spontaneous sword fights. It’s just not something people can suddenly do.</li> 
    
    <li>The scene is <strong>situationally</strong> surreal. They’re collecting rocks from tall grass without gloves, work clothes, wheelbarrows, and so on.</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p>In the same way extended fist fights don’t actually happen in the world, extended witty repartee doesn’t happen either. These things are surreal!</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
<p class="considertext">In real life, there <sem>are</sem> witty conversations, and there <sem>are</sem> fist fights&mdash;but they’re <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> extended, rhythmic, unhesitating, and crystal clear to spectators, like they can be in some spectator entertainment. </p>
   
    
<p class="considertext">Once it’s pointed out, it’s obvious that scripted, practiced, stylized, witty conversations <sem>aren't</sem> straightforward mirrors to the witty conversations that happen in real life.</p>
 </div>
 
 <p>We'll be talking about this surreality throughout this chapter.</p>
 
     <div class="box">
    
<p><headline>Coherent and surreal.</headline>  When the audience watches Rage Man punch through concrete in the opening scene of <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title>, they know this is surreal&mdash;people can't punch through concrete.</p> 

<p>Even though it's <term>surreal</term>, Rage Man's strength can still be <em>coherent</em> if the movie is consistent to its surreal premise. If he can punch through concrete all throughout the movie, it's surreal and coherent&mdash;but we wouldn't take this coherence to be the same thing as realism.</p>

<p>It's the same for emotions too. If James Bond is always calm or focused, the emotional premise is that he always has a large OK and small mistake. We know this is surreal&mdash;people aren't calm when gambling, fighting, debating, and so on.</p>

 <p>At the same time, if the movie is <sem-weak>consistent</sem-weak> to these surreal evaluatory premises the movie will be emotionally <term>surreal</term> while still be emotionally <em>coherent</em>.</p>


<p>As before, we shouldn't take this coherence to be the same thing as realism. If James Bond is consistently unflappable, that doesn't mean it's realistic&mdash;it just means its consistent.</p>
