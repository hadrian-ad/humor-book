<body>

<p>In this chapter, we'll look at how spectator entertainment is <vocab>surreal</vocab>.

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">The things depicted in spectator entertainment <sem>can't</sem> happen without effort and the intention to prioritize others&mdash;what we're calling surreal.</p>
    

    
    <p class="considertext">We can't expect this effort and intention to happen without effort and intention&mdash;these surreal things can't straightforwardly happen spontaneously in our life.</p>
    
    <!--
    <p class="considertext">Anything from rehearsal to a replay button to stage make-up contribute to this surrealness&mdash;a sometimes subtle or hard-to-see distinction .</p> 
    -->
    
    </div>


<p>It's obvious that fight scenes are surreal:</p>

<div class="vignette">
   <p><narration>Owen and Emma are watching the trailer for <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title>.</narration></p>
    
    <p><narration>The hero, Rage Man, guns down dozens of henchmen while they ineffectively return fire. Then a missile explodes near him, throwing Rage Man against a concrete wall&mdash;but he gets up in time to behead a charging henchmen with a keyboard.</narration> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <speech>“You know, I hear your body just liquidates if you’re close enough to be blasted off your feet by an explosion.”</speech> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Owen:</speaker> <action>*laughs*</action> <speech>“Yeah, but the dude’s not even wearing earplugs, so he’s clearly made of sterner stuff!”</speech> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><speaker>Emma:</speaker> <internalaction>(thoughtfully)</internalaction> <speech>“Do you think you could really decapitate someone with a keyboard?”</speech> <action>*laughs*</action> <notes>(&larr;action is surreal)</notes></p>          
    </div>

<p>Emma and Owen know this is surreal&mdash;they don't go around thinking that they could elegantly decapitate henchmen with keyboards.</p>

<div class="consider">
   <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
    
    <p class="considertext">It doesn't matter to Emma and Owen that <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title> is surreal&mdash;because they aren't looking for realism for realism’s sake.</p> 
    
    <p class="considertext">They want the movie to <term>entertain</term> them&mdash;not to <em>teach</em> them how to fight with keyboards.</p>
    </div>

<p>But while it’s often obvious to us that <term>action</term> scenes are surreal, we don’t always think of <em>comedy</em> scenes as being equally surreal&mdash;but they are!</p>

<div class="vignette">
    <p><narration>Sarah is trying to make a video of a funny rant. She's been scripting in her head on the bus ride home, and when she gets home she hops in front of the mirror for some aesthetic adjustments.</narration> 
    
    <p><narration>She opens the blinds for light, and then records herself. She's not satisfied with the take.</narration></p> 
    
    <p><narration>She repositioning herself, takes a few breaths, and records again.</narration> </p>
    
    <p><narration>Satisfied, she trims the ending of the clip a bit, and hits upload.</narration> <notes>(&larr;rant video is surreal)</notes></p>
    
    <p><narration>Zoe watches a great rant by Sarah about her daycare kids. Sarah's so funny!</narration></p>
</div>

<p>Above, Sarah's video is surreal. In the same way <term>Owen</term> can't be like <term>Rage Man</term> <callback>(use grit to survive missiles)</callback>, <em>Zoe</em> can't be like <em>Sarah</em> <callback>(give fluid, funny rants)</callback>.</p> 

<p>In fact, <term>Rage Man's actor</term> can't be like <term>Rage Man</term>, and <em>Sarah</em> can't spontaneously be like her <em>performance character</em>.</p> 

<p>When we can seperate what is and isn't possible to experience or do spontaneously, we can relate better to spectator entertainment.</p>

     <p>We'll be talking about this surreality throughout this chapter.</p>

         There's nothing wrong with surreal things&mdash;instead, <sem-weak>we</sem-weak> can be wrong if we don't spot when surreal things require effort and intention to produce.</p> 
         
         <p class="considertext">
         Partly, it's a matter of apples and oranges. There are two skills: <term>producing</term> amusing rant videos, and actually <em>ranting</em> to someone.</p>
         
         <p class="considertext">If Zoe confuses the two, she can make inaccurate comparisons or judgements.</p>

<p><headline>Coherent and surreal.</headline>  

  When the audience watches Rage Man punch through concrete in the opening scene of <book-title>Blood Soul Revenge</book-title>, the audience knows this is surreal&mdash;people can't punch through concrete.</p> 

<p>Even though it's <term>surreal</term>, Rage Man's strength can still be <em>coherent</em> if the movie is consistent to its surreal premise. Rage Man punches through concrene throughout the movie, making his abilities both surreal and coherent&mdash;but we shouldn't take this coherence to be the same thing as realism.</p>

<p>It's the same for emotions too. Rage Man is always angry, so the emotional premise is that he always has a large mistake and small OK. We know this is surreal&mdash;people get calm from time to time.</p>  
 
<!--
      If James Bond is always calm or focused, the emotional premise is that he always has a large OK and small mistake. We know this is surreal&mdash;people aren't calm when gambling, fighting, debating, and so on.
-->

 <p>At the same time, if the movie is <sem-weak>consistent</sem-weak> to these surreal evaluatory premises, the movie will be emotionally <term>surreal</term> while still be emotionally <em>coherent</em>.</p>

<p>As before, we shouldn't take this coherence to be the same thing as realism. If Rage Man is consistently furious, that doesn't mean it's realistic&mdash;it just means it's consistent.</p>

<p>This is relevant to comedies, where the character's emotional reactions may be coherent to a surreal emotional premise&mdash;and we shouldn't take it for more realistic than it is.   </p>
