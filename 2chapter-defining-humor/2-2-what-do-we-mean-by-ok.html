    What do we mean by "OK"?
</h1>

    <p>
    The next part of the pattern we'll look at is <vocab>OK</vocab>.</p> 
            
<p class="lesson">
    Humor is a mistake that’s evaluated as <i>OK</i>.
    </p>

    
    <p>In this book, OK doesn't refer to something "good"&mdash;instead, it refers to someone's personal relation to consequences:

    In all these examples, people felt that a mistake was OK.</p> 
    <!--
    <p>They encountered something that was a <vocab>deviation from their expectations</vocab>. At the same time, they felt they were <vocab>personally secure from negative consequences</vocab>. 
    </p>
    -->

<div class="box">   
          <p><headline>Consequences.</headline>
           A more formal term for OK would be <vocab>secure from negative personal consequences</vocab>. As we observe things, we pay attention to how those observations will personally affect us.
           </p>
       <p>
           This isn’t about whether something is good or bad&mdash;it's just about our sense of security to negative personal consequences.

       <div class="for-instance">
           <p class="for-instance">
               For instance:
               </p>
           
           <p class="for-instance-text">
               If we hear a building collapses two thousand miles away from us, we may feel it’s OK&mdash;because we feel we are <sem>personally</sem> secure from negative consequences. This doesn’t mean we’re “okay” that it happened!</p> 
               
               <p class="for-instance-text">All our OK here means is that the possibility of <sem-weak>personal</sem-weak> consequences seems remote.
               </p>
           <p class="for-instance-text">
               By contrast, if the building next door to us collapsed, or a building collapsed in the city our best friend lived in, we won’t feel <sem>personally</sem> secure from negative consequences&mdash;and it would be <outcome-contrast>not</outcome-contrast> OK.

       </div>
       <p>
           We’ll be using both terms interchangeably <callback>(OK = secure from negative personal consequences)</callback>. We’ll mostly use “OK,” since it’s shorter and less cumbersome.
