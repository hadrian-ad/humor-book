<h2 id="2-03">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h2>
<!--    01.30 -->

 <p>The last part of our pattern is the word <vocab>evaluated</vocab>.</p>

<p class="lesson">Humor is a mistake that’s <i>evaluated</i> as OK.</p>



    <p>The word evaluation is like a hinge, where mistakes can swivel to OK or to not-OK. This lets our pattern describe when humor does and <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> occur:</p>

<p>This is the start of our  <vocab>model definition</vocab> of humor. We'll keep adding and refining it as we go along.</p>

 <p>A model is something that simplifies something more complex&mdash;a bit like how a map simplifies what it's mapping. Since you can't hold a 1:1 map of Canada in your hand, you simplify how you represent Canada until it meets your needs.

        <p>We introduced our model definition of humor. This model uses two input parameters: a <vocab>mistake and an OK</vocab>. We also described these inputs as coming from a person&mdash;they're <vocab>evaluations</vocab>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <strong><a href="2-1-what-do-we-mean-by-mistake.html">mistake</a></strong> is something that deviates from our expectations. A mistake isn't "good" or "bad"&mdash;it's just about how something relates to our expectations.</li>
    <li>Our <strong><a href="2-2-what-do-we-mean-by-ok.html">OK</a></strong> is how secure we feel from personal negative consequences. An OK doesn't mean we're "okay with" something bad happening. It's just how we're relating ourselves to negative consequences.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="2-3-what-do-we-mean-by-evaluated.html">Evaluations</a></strong> create these mistakes and OK. This means someone is required for there to be humor. Without an evaluator, there's no mistake or OK&mdash;and so can't be humor.</li>
