<h1 id="exclude-navigation">What do we mean by “evaluated”?</h1>
<!--    01.30 -->

 <p>The last part of our pattern is the word <vocab>evaluated</vocab>.</p>

<p class="lesson">Humor is a mistake that’s <i>evaluated</i> as OK.</p>



    <p>The word evaluation is like a hinge, where mistakes can swivel to OK or to not-OK. This lets our pattern describe when humor does and <outcome-contrast>doesn’t</outcome-contrast> occur:</p>

       <p class="considertext">Does a book of jokes sitting on a shelf have any humor in it? Not according to our humor pattern&mdash;since no one is currently <sem-weak>evaluating</sem-weak> the jokes. Humor is only possible if someone is evaluating the jokes.</p>

            <p>That's because we won't be able to fully understand why we sometimes laugh at jokes, hugs, failure, and so on without also being able to understand why we sometimes <outcome-contrast>don’t</outcome-contrast> laugh at them.</p> 
            
            <p>By the end of this book, we’ll become as comfortable explaining the <term>presence</term> of laughter as we are explaining the <em>absence</em> of laughter.</p>

    <p>In this book, we'll be assembling one way of thinking about humor&mdash;a model of humor.</p> 
    
    <p><term>Last</term> chapter we had:</p> 
    
     <p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion</p>

<p><em>This</em> chapter we had:</p>

<p class="lesson">Humor is a mistake that's evaluated as OK</p>

<p>We can connect these together to get our current model of humor:</p>

     
<p class="lesson">Humor is an emotion that someone feels when they evaluate a mistake as OK</p>   
 
 
<p>This is the start of our  <vocab>model definition</vocab> of humor. A model is something that simplifies something more complex&mdash;a bit like how a map simplifies what it's mapping.

 <p class="considertext">We can map Canada in all kinds of ways. These different maps aren't wrong&mdash;instead, our <sem-weak>choice</sem-weak> of map can right or wrong, depending on our task or goals. It's the same for models.</p>

 <p>This book owes a debt of gratitude to the philosopher Warren Shibles. 
   His lunar clarity of thought made a unforgettable impression on me as a teenager&mdash;and set me down a long path of humor ethnography and teaching.</p>
 
<p>My fate was sealed the moment I stumbled across Shible's monumental (and monumentally weird) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;a forgotten, uncompleted, contradictory, and occasionally disturbing opus that now exists only on Internet archives. I got hooked bad.</p>

<p>This book initiated me&mdash;not painlessly or quickly&mdash;into several profound mysteries that I'll be unfolding for you over the course of this book. My goal is to unfold these with greater grace. After all, when the light shines just right on this subject, there's smile-causing beauty to things&mdash;an angle of illumination I hope to help you find with less struggle.</p> 

<p>I am not part of any academic tradition of humor&mdash;the ideas in this book came not from study but from years of growing the seeds Warren Shibles planted in me.</p> 

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">Shibles' personal style of "philosophical psychology" also helped ground my thoughts during times where other approaches&mdash;computational, biochemical, or clinical psychology&mdash;had a kind of hegemony over everything.</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">We've probably all read books that try to draw authority from these approaches. <callback>("Several studies confirm that people like laughing. Let's talk about the chemistry.")</callback></p>
    </div>
    
 <p>There's something refreshing about Shibles&mdash;a career failure, he could never gain the respect of his students, department, discipline, or publishers.</p>
 
  <p>Despite this, he wrote prolifically, publishing books on humor, emotions, death, lies, ethics, time, love, humanism, joy, linguistics, metaphor, and so on. These books achieved little readership and occasionally direct scorn.</p>
 
 <p>He insisted that the only legitimate purpose of scholarship was understanding joy&mdash;but as an autistic man, with a penchant for attacking second-wave feminism, he had an almost comical inability to articulate this case.</p> 
 
 <p>The few people who read his books frequently described them as simple, naive, or just plain maddening. I felt this too at times, the sort of rage and generously large <sem-weak>wtf</sem-weak> that characterizes reading a book like <book-title>Time: A Critical Analysis for Children</book-title>.</p> 
  
  <p>On the other hand, whenever I would close one eye&mdash;what I would see was this distant, lunar clarity he was channeling. This priestly revelation was the one calm, coherent thing I had ever encountered. Untangling all this wool for re-weaving has been inescapable passion of mine.</p>
  
  <p>I like thinking about Shibles canoeing out onto the lake he lived by, where he liked to think, away from his petty coworkers who looked down on him. He had a special friend in Germany whom he loved, and when he died, the obituary he wrote read: "What began as an investigation into death became an exploration of love and joy."</p>
   
    <p>I never met him, but consider him an important teacher in an important tradition. I am glad to dedicate this book to his memory.</p>

    <div class="content">

        <p>We introduced our model definition of humor. This model uses two input parameters: a <vocab>mistake and an OK</vocab>. We also described these inputs as coming from a person&mdash;they're <vocab>evaluations</vocab>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>A <strong><a href="2-1-what-do-we-mean-by-mistake.html">mistake</a></strong> is something that deviates from our expectations. A mistake isn't "good" or "bad"&mdash;it's just about how something relates to our expectations.</li>
    <li>Our <strong><a href="2-2-what-do-we-mean-by-ok.html">OK</a></strong> is how secure we feel from personal negative consequences. An OK doesn't mean we're "okay with" something bad happening. It's just how we're relating ourselves to negative consequences.</li>
    <li><strong><a href="2-3-what-do-we-mean-by-evaluated.html">Evaluations</a></strong> create these mistakes and OK. This means someone is required for there to be humor. Without an evaluator, there's no mistake or OK&mdash;and so can't be humor.</li>
