 <p>This book owes a debt of gratitude to the philosopher Warren Shibles. 
   His lunar clarity of thought made a unforgettable impression on me as a teenager&mdash;and set me down a long path of humor ethnography and teaching.</p>
 
<p>My fate was sealed the moment I stumbled across Shible's monumental (and monumentally weird) <book-title>Online Humor Reference Guide</book-title>&mdash;a forgotten, uncompleted, contradictory, and occasionally disturbing opus that now exists only on Internet archives. I got hooked bad.</p>

<p>This book initiated me&mdash;not painlessly or quickly&mdash;into several profound mysteries that I'll be unfolding for you over the course of this book. My goal is to unfold these with greater grace. After all, when the light shines just right on this subject, there's smile-causing beauty to things&mdash;an angle of illumination I hope to help you find with less struggle.</p> 

<p>I am not part of any academic tradition of humor&mdash;the ideas in this book came not from study but from years of growing the seeds Warren Shibles planted in me.</p> 

<div class="consider"><p class="consider">Consider:</p> 
    <p class="considertext">Shibles' personal style of "philosophical psychology" also helped ground my thoughts during times where other approaches&mdash;computational, biochemical, or clinical psychology&mdash;had a kind of hegemony over everything.</p>
    
     <p class="considertext">We've probably all read books that try to draw authority from these approaches. <callback>("Several studies confirm that people like laughing. Let's talk about the chemistry.")</callback></p>
    </div>
    
 <p>There's something refreshing about Shibles&mdash;a career failure, he could never gain the respect of his students, department, discipline, or publishers.</p>
 
  <p>Despite this, he wrote prolifically, publishing books on humor, emotions, death, lies, ethics, time, love, humanism, joy, linguistics, metaphor, and so on. These books achieved little readership and occasionally direct scorn.</p>
 
 <p>He insisted that the only legitimate purpose of scholarship was understanding joy&mdash;but as an autistic man, with a penchant for attacking second-wave feminism, he had an almost comical inability to articulate this case.</p> 
 
 <p>The few people who read his books frequently described them as simple, naive, or just plain maddening. I felt this too at times, the sort of rage and generously large <sem-weak>wtf</sem-weak> that characterizes reading a book like <book-title>Time: A Critical Analysis for Children</book-title>.</p> 
  
  <p>On the other hand, whenever I would close one eye&mdash;what I would see was this distant, lunar clarity he was channeling. This priestly revelation was the one calm, coherent thing I had ever encountered. Untangling all this wool for re-weaving has been inescapable passion of mine.</p>
  
  <p>I like thinking about Shibles canoeing out onto the lake he lived by, where he liked to think, away from his petty coworkers who looked down on him. He had a special friend in Germany whom he loved, and when he died, the obituary he wrote read: "What began as an investigation into death became an exploration of love and joy."</p>
   
    <p>I never met him, but consider him an important teacher in an important tradition. I am glad to dedicate this book to his memory.</p>

         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">A model is something that approximates or predicts outcomes. Models do this by simplifying something more complex—like how a map works.</p>
         
<p class="considertext">A <term>map</term> of Canada is a <term>map</term>, not Canada. In the same way, a <term2>model</term2> of humor is a <term2>model</term2>, not humor.</p> 
         
     </div>

     
     
      <p>There's no single way of describing humor. This is just one model of humor that exists simultaneously with others. Like a tool in our toolbox, we can use this model or not as it fits our observations and goals.</p> 
                 
                 
<div class="consider">
  <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
  <p class="considertext">We sometimes we get so used to models that we start to think the <term>models</term> are actually the <term>thing</term> they're modeling&mdash;which is a bit like thinking a <term2>portrait</term2> of a person is the <term2>person</term2> themselves!</p> 
           
    <p class="considertext">This book is like a portrait or map of humor&mdash;not actually humor itself.</p>   
      </div>   
                  
<p>Since most people haven't been taught any good models of humor, we often think it's not really possible&mdash;and even potentially misleading or degrading. Historically, this is a warranted fear&mdash;something we'll talk about in later chapters. </p> 
   
       


     

<p>Our model of humor will be useful in a few ways. We'll use it to think coherently and insightfully about humor. We'll also use it to help us in our day-to-day life and activities.</p>

    <p>A model is good or bad based on our goals.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
     
    <p class="for-instance-text
    ">A globe would be bad if our goal was to plan a bike route to the store. On the other hand, a globe would be good if our goal was to quickly see where political borders are.</p>
</div>

   <p>The goal of our model of humor is to spark insight, and to help us answer questions about humor in ways that seem organized, productive, and satisfying.</p>
   
<p>Some models are very complex and require computing to use&mdash;but our particular model is meant to be something simple that we can use in day-to-day situations.</p>   


            

<p>Many people are suspicious of modeling humor, and for good reason&mdash;many previous models of humor have been cruel, degrading, dismissive, incoherent, narrow, oddly focused, subordinate to ulterior motives, and so on.</p>
    
<p>We'll revisit this history later in this book. But as this book was started in part because of skepticism to how humor has been modeled, this book can only encourage continuing skepticism on your end.</p>   
 

    
<div class="for-instance">
         <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
          
          <p class="for-instance-text">Many of us have heard the model <callback>comedy = tragedy + time</callback>. This model is usually used proverbially, and so is usually "good .</p>
          
          <p class="for-instance-text">However, we can see that it's not far away from our current model of mistakes and OKs&mdash;which, as we'll see, have improvements over that other model.</p>
