         <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
         <p class="considertext">A model is something that approximates or predicts outcomes. Models do this by simplifying something more complexâ€”like how a map works.</p>
         
<p class="considertext">A <term>map</term> of Canada is a <term>map</term>, not Canada. In the same way, a <em>model</em> of humor is a <em>model</em>, not humor.</p> 
         
     </div>

     
     
      <p>There's no single way of describing humor. This is just one model of humor that exists simultaneously with others. Like a tool in our toolbox, we can use this model or not as it fits our observations and goals.</p> 
                 
                 
<div class="consider">
  <p class="consider">Consider:</p>
  <p class="considertext">We sometimes we get so used to models that we start to think the <term>models</term> are actually the <term>thing</term> they're modeling&mdash;which is a bit like thinking a <em>portrait</em> of a person is the <em>person</em> themselves!</p> 
           
    <p class="considertext">This book is like a portrait or map of humor&mdash;not actually humor itself.</p>   
      </div>   
                  
<p>Since most people haven't been taught any good models of humor, we often think it's not really possible&mdash;and even potentially misleading or degrading. Historically, this is a warranted fear&mdash;something we'll talk about in later chapters. </p> 
   
       


     

<p>Our model of humor will be useful in a few ways. We'll use it to think coherently and insightfully about humor. We'll also use it to help us in our day-to-day life and activities.</p>

    <p>A model is good or bad based on our goals.</p> 

<div class="for-instance">
    <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
     
    <p class="for-instance-text
    ">A globe would be bad if our goal was to plan a bike route to the store. On the other hand, a globe would be good if our goal was to quickly see where political borders are.</p>
</div>

   <p>The goal of our model of humor is to spark insight, and to help us answer questions about humor in ways that seem organized, productive, and satisfying.</p>
   
<p>Some models are very complex and require computing to use&mdash;but our particular model is meant to be something simple that we can use in day-to-day situations.</p>   


            

<p>Many people are suspicious of modeling humor, and for good reason&mdash;many previous models of humor have been cruel, degrading, dismissive, incoherent, narrow, oddly focused, subordinate to ulterior motives, and so on.</p>
    
<p>We'll revisit this history later in this book. But as this book was started in part because of skepticism to how humor has been modeled, this book can only encourage continuing skepticism on your end.</p>   
 
 

    
<div class="for-instance">
         <p class="for-instance">For instance:</p>
          
          <p class="for-instance-text">Many of us have heard the model <callback>comedy = tragedy + time</callback>. This model is usually used proverbially, and so is usually "good .</p>
          
          <p class="for-instance-text">However, we can see that it's not far away from our current model of mistakes and OKs&mdash;which, as we'll see, have improvements over that other model.</p>
